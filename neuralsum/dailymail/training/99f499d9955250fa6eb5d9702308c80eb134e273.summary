by @entity0 he may not be able to bring people back from the dead , but one scientist can make corpses look fresher thanks to s secret chemical bathing process			1
dr @entity8 has developed an unusual method to transform gnarled human remains into plumper and more life - like bodies			1
the process is so useful as it can reveal features such as fingerprints , scars and tattoos , which can be used to identify individuals and solve crimes			1
he plunges whole bodies - as well as body parts ( pictured in the boxes ) into a large tank filled with a secret mixture of chemicals only dr @entity8 knows the ingredients of this secret soak which is used to refresh corpses			1
after a few days to a week , shrivelled and partially - mummified remains are ' pumped up ' and look like fresher corpses			2
features such as scars , tattoos and moles are revealed that can identify individuals and can potentially be used to solve crimes			1
bathing a hand can also revive it enough so that fingerprints can be taken			0
while other methods are also used to obtain fingerprints from shrivelled hands , dr @entity8 ' is thought to be the only one that can freshen up whole bodies			1
they are bathed in a tank containing 60gallons ( 273litres ) of his secret mixture			2
dr @entity8 told @entity51 that he divides him time between dentistry , teaching forensic courses at @entity54 and identifying human remains at the @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 – a region renowned for its violence and high murder rate			1
since 2008 he has been plunging bodies – some shrivelled and scorched and some disfigured from accidents – into a tank that he refers to as the ‘ jacuzzi ’			2
it holds approximately 60 gallons ( 273 litres ) of a secret chemical formula which magically turns back time and plumps up bodies left to soak for around five days			0
the method has so far revealed scars , moles , tattoos and wounds as well as fingerprints that have been used to identify missing people			2
heads shrivelled in the desert heat regain plump lips and bruises that hint at a person ’s final moments			0
bodies go through seven stages of decomposition and dr @entity8 ’ technique reverses two of these stages – putrefaction when the proteins in the body break down so that tissue rots and decomposition , when water in the body dries up – leaving shrivelled remains			1
since 2008 dr @entity8 has been plunging bodies - some shrivelled and scorched such as the head and hand pictured - into a tank that he refers to as the ' jacuzzi '			1
his method has so far revealed scars , moles , tattoos and moles which can be used to identify individuals and potentially to solve crimes dr @entity8 added that his patent - pending secret soak can reveal a corpse ’s identity and sometimes the cause of death			1
he has done hundreds of body part rehydrations and around a dozen full body soaks			0
when a body is taken out of the bath it feels plump and limbs and joints such as fingers are pliable – but it smells			0
while he bathes the bodies , he talks to the corpses and condoles them , according to a report in the @entity125			0
he sometimes plays them romantic music while they float , or turns on rap and hip - hop for victims whose faces look ‘ menacing ’			0
glycerin injections have long been used to reconstitute fingers from which to get fingerprints , but the method can not be used for whole bodies			2
it is of particular use in the dusty region , where bodies decompose and mummify rapidly in the fierce heat of the city and its surrounding desert landscape			0
dr @entity8 does what many people might consider a grim job to give grieving families the chance to bury loved ones dumped in sprawling mass graves in the city of @entity154 ( mapped ) which contains unidentified bodies dr @entity8 said that his patent - pending secret soak can reveal a corpse 's identity and sometimes the cause of death			1
fingertips can be ' plumped up ' so that prints can be taken from them ( pictured ) - even if the remains were formerly partially mummified			0
other methods exist to extract prints in this way , but dr @entity8 is thought to be the only one that can ' revive ' whole bodies forensic researchers from the @entity172 secured a patent for a rehydration technique to obtain fingerprints from dehydrated fingers			1
their ‘ @entity178 ’ method uses sodium hydroxide to plump up a finger , but timing is critical as too much of the chemical could dissolve it completely			0
it is unknown whether the same chemical is used in dr @entity8 ' process , but experts think he is the only person attempting the feat on such a large scale			2
dr @entity191 , a forensic researcher at @entity192 , @entity190 has witnessed a full - body rehydration and said : ‘ it was quite amazing			0
it looked like a relatively fresh body			0
’ dr @entity8 does what many people might consider a grim job to give grieving families the chance to bury loved ones dumped in sprawling mass graves in the area which contains unidentified bodies			2
he even funds the rehydration technique himself .			0

*warning* *graphic* content
secret mixture of chemicals is used to make corpses them look fresher
method is used to identify individuals and solve crimes in @entity154 , @entity58 , which is renowned for its high murder rate
it can mean fingerprints can be taken from formerly shrivelled bodies and identify features like scars , tattoos and injuries revealed
other techniques exist for reviving *bodyparts* such as fingertips but dr @entity8 is the only expert refreshing entire bodies
