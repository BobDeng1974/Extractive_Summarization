veteran @entity1 dj @entity0 has accused the police of launching a ' witch hunt ' against innocent celebrities to cover up their failures over @entity6			1
the 65 - year - old said he had suffered ' a year from hell ' as officers tried to drum up their case against him after he was arrested in 2013			1
he was finally told he would not face any sexual assault charges in october			1
mr @entity0 also claimed he had been ' left out to dry ' on bail for months longer than necessary because the police did not want people to see a former radio 1 dj cleared before their case against his former colleague @entity18 had concluded			1
mr @entity0 blamed his arrest on the ' moral panic ' sparked by the revelations over @entity33 which exposed the police 's own failures to stop the prolific paedophile			1
' i faced the full weight of the state with unlimited financial resources for 12 months for no reason - it was a completely fictitious case , ' he told the @entity24			1
he said : ' someone whose identity we do not know , who i call the @entity57 , the person sitting behind the curtain , pulling the levers , setting off smoke and light shows , decided " i 've got a great idea , let 's have a witch - hunt , let 's divert the attention of the public from the police who knew about but failed to stop @entity6 in his lifetime and shine that spotlight instead on his contemporaries and we 'll get perverts from show business in the 1970s and 1980s ''			1
' the furious @entity1 @entity20 added : ' when you open a website and a phone line - as the police did - for the dedicated purpose of accusing celebrities , then you are going to get some people who are responding to the offer of money and attention			1
' he told @entity75 there was no excuse for his treatment and urged them to overhaul the law to protect innocent victims from spending months on bail			1
' it 's obvious they wanted to keep me in the frame , because my name got out to the press ' [ but ] there is no possible excuse for leaving someone out to dry			2
' he added : ' you do n't need a witch hunt to enforce the law			2
' he also accused the @entity94 of carefully timing the extensions of his bail to coincide with big sex abuse cases , such as the @entity99 trial , in order to avoid public scrutiny over their flimsy case against him			2
mr @entity0 blamed his arrest on the ' moral panic ' sparked by the revelations over @entity6 which exposed the police 's failure to tackle abuse over decades mr @entity0 told mps he was ' left out to dry ' until the end of the case against @entity18			1
he also said he was re-bailed to coincide with the case against @entity99 ( right ) while mr @entity0 was making the accusation it emerged @entity99 had been stripped of his cbe , awarded to him by the queen the 84 - year - old @entity119 was awarded the @entity117 in 2006 for his services to entertainment but it has now been retracted following his sentencing to six years in prison after being found guilty of sexually assaulting girls as young as seven - years - old			1

the @entity130 - born @entity20 was re-bailed several times during his ordeal – and only found out about one after it had been reported to the @entity1 and @entity133			1

mr @entity0 had his bail extended when publicist @entity141 was sentenced for indecent assaults he told the committee that during that time , his bail was extended on seven occasions with only ' vague ' explanations from police , but he gradually realised that the dates often coincided with important developments in the @entity150 investigation			1
bail was extended on may 2 , when publicist @entity141 was sentenced for historic indecent assaults , on june 30 , hours after the conviction of @entity99 and on september 12 , when former @entity153 doctor @entity152 appeared in court charged with rape , he said			2
' you know what they say			2
twice is a coincidence , three times is a trend , ' said mr @entity0			1
' it was kind of interesting when i was rebailed the same day @entity141 was sentenced			0
it was kind of infuriating when i was rebailed the same day @entity99 was convicted			0
but then when i was rebailed again when @entity152 was charged , i thought ' ok , what they are doing here is trying to bury the news of my being rebailed forever , because if anybody wanted to write an article about @entity176 on those days , it would n't be about me , it would be about the other suspects '			0
' when his bail was extended to september 15 , he suspected a link to the trial of @entity18 , which was due to end on that date			0
' i thought , ' this is the most obvious thing in the world			0
they are sitting on me until they are finished with @entity18 , because they do n't want the @entity18 jury to know that a former radio 1 dj can be innocent '			0
' i do believe - though i do n't have any evidence for this - that they were just sitting on me until @entity18 was finished , ' he said			2
the veteran disc jockey told mps that no one was above the law , but said celebrities were more vulnerable to false allegations because more people know them			1
he added : ' this person went after me because i was the famous person in his neighbourhood			0
' after dropping their case against him , the @entity94 revealed that the allegations against him involved two underage boys who were around 14 and 15			0

' you just did n't mess with @entity209			0
' he was the governor , because after all he had been the first great club @entity20 , he had been the originator of @entity254 and you just let him have his turf			2
' and none of us were interested in going there			0
' at social occasions we would all be together , but @entity209 would not be			0
he had his own life , ' he said on live television			0
