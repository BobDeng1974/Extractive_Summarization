@entity0 has captured the rare sight of three of @entity4 's largest moons parading across the giant gas planet 's banded face			1
the telescope took a string of images of the event which show the three satellites — @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 — in action 601 million miles ( 968 million km ) from @entity16			1
the @entity4 lunar gathering , which happens only once or twice a decade , was captured on january 23 showing the unusual sight in a single frame			1

@entity4 and its moons have long fascinated astronomers			2
the ones seen in these images are called @entity34 satellites — named after the 17th century scientist @entity36 who discovered them			0
they complete orbits around @entity4 ranging from two to seventeen days in duration			2
each of the moons can commonly be seen transiting the face of @entity4 and casting shadows onto its layers of cloud			2
the image on the left shows the @entity0 observation at the beginning of the event			0
on the left is the @entity53 and on the right , @entity14			2
the shadows from @entity12 , which can not be seen in the image , @entity13 , and @entity14 are strung out from left to right the @entity4 lunar gathering , which happens only once or twice a decade , was captured on january 23 showing the unusual sight in a single frame astronomers believe the rough , icy surface of @entity4 's moon , @entity12 , is the most likely place in the solar system to harbour alien life			1
' for the first time in the history of humanity we have the tools and technology and capability to potentially answer this question			0
and , we know where to go to find it , ' @entity74 , a @entity75 astrobiologist , said last year			0
the $ 18.5 billion @entity75 budget recently proposed by the @entity79 for next year includes money earmarked for a mission to the moon			0
previous scientific findings point to the existence of a liquid water ocean located under the moon 's icy crust			2
this ocean covers @entity12 entirely and contains more liquid water than all of @entity16 's oceans combined			1
@entity12 is the sixth closest moon to @entity4 and the smallest of the four @entity34 satellites that belong to the planet			1
it is one of the smoothest objects in the solar system with few craters on its surface			0
the moon @entity14 , which orbits significantly closer to @entity4 and so moves much more quickly , can be seen approaching the eastern limb of the planet			1
while @entity13 's shadow seems hardly to have moved , @entity14 's has set over the planet 's eastern edge and @entity12 's has risen further in the west			1
missing from this sequence is the @entity109 which was outside @entity0 's field of view			0
each moons of @entity4 have very distinctive colours			0
the smooth icy surface of @entity12 is yellow - white , the volcanic sulphur surface of @entity14 is orange and the surface of @entity53 , is a brownish colour			1
the moons are bigger than all the dwarf planets , and @entity120 , @entity13 and @entity14 are all larger than @entity16 's moon			1
@entity120 , meanwhile , is larger than the planet @entity123			0
the images were taken with @entity0 's @entity125 in visible light			0
while @entity0 captures these moons in great clarity , @entity75 says they can also be seen with a small telescope or even a strong pair of binoculars from home			0
each moons of @entity4 have very distinctive colours			0
the smooth icy surface of @entity12 is yellow - white , the volcanic sulphur surface of @entity14 is orange and the surface of @entity53 , is a brownish colour			2

images show @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 601 million miles away from @entity16
the @entity4 lunar gathering only happens only once or twice a decade
the moon @entity14 can be seen approaching the eastern limb of the planet
while @entity13 's hardly moves , @entity14 's sets over the planet 's eastern edge
meanwhile @entity12 and its shadow can be seen rising further in the west
