by @entity0 published : 03:56 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 11:04 est , 30 october 2013 an aristocrat is facing a battle with the @entity3 and furious locals over plans to build a cable car at one of the most beautiful spots in the south west of @entity10			1
the @entity11 , who is said to have acquired as many as 75 ‘ wifelets ’ to share the romantic side of his eccentric life , wants to install a cable car to encourage tourists to visit picturesque @entity19 in @entity20			1
the 81 - year - old owns the southern portion of the gorge but the north belongs to the @entity3 , which fiercely opposes the plans , claiming the £ 10m scheme will ' destroy ' the three - mile - long site			0
his plan has been hatched in response to a huge decline in visitor numbers to the site over the past four decades			0
@entity32 : @entity19 in @entity20 is ranked among @entity34 's most beautiful scenery			2
a company owned by the @entity11 wants to build a cable car at the site , which would look similar to this mock - up above the plans : the 600m cable car would run from either point a or point b through a small section of the three - mile long @entity19 to the @entity42			1
@entity43 also hopes to build a viewing platform and sky bridge at the top the conservation body 's views are echoed by locals , who feel the gorge , which also boasts ancient caves , would be made more vulgar if the cable car was built			1
@entity52 , assistant director of operations at the @entity3 , said : ' @entity3 is objecting to the proposal by @entity54 to build a cable car in @entity19			1
' we are working with @entity57 and other organisations to drive business in the @entity19 without destroying the very asset that people come to see			2
it is far better to retain the uniqueness of the place			0
' we welcome and support the initiative to take a fresh look at how @entity19 can regain its reputation as a one of the @entity34 top visitor attractions , and would like to play a full and active part in exploring this further			2
' the @entity3 has already denied permission for the car to run over its portion of the gorge but has no authority over the @entity11 owns			2
however , it is set to lobby local planning authorities over the proposals			0
@entity78 : @entity3 fiercely opposes the plans , claiming the £ 10m plans will ' destroy ' the three mile long beauty spot sketch : an artist impression of the how the top station of the cable car in the @entity19 may look @entity86 , director of @entity19 and @entity87 , said the estate needs paying tourists as it is not funded by grants - like the @entity3 - and tourist numbers have dwindled from 400,000 a year in the 1970s and 80s to just 150,000			1
' visually the cable car is a downside although the visual signature is quite small , ' mr @entity86 said			1
he added that the extra income from the cable car will benefit the area as the money can be ploughed into conservation , wildlife protection and maintenance			1
however , he admitted some of the income would be profit for the @entity11 , who in 2011 had an estimated wealth of £ 157million			0
he continued : ' @entity105 share the view that @entity19 is the finest limestone @entity19 in @entity34 , that it is a @entity108 for its rare calcareous grasslands , that it is a @entity110 for bats , amongst other endangered fauna , and with six caves that are scheduled @entity114 it is definitely a prehistoric site of national importance			0
the 81 - year - old marquess of @entity11 , pictured with long - term mistress @entity118 , owns the southern portion of the gorge			0
his representative says the extra revenue will help towards upkeep local economy : the representative for @entity11 , pictured at the reopening of @entity127 after the foot - and - mouth crisis in 2001 , said tourism is vital to the area ' however looking after @entity19 , and cherishing its values , costs money			1
the government , at a time of national austerity , has more immediate calls on @entity138 funding to provide education , health care and decent pensions for @entity143 people , rather than spending money on re-establishing rare grasslands and protecting karst limestone cliffs from erosion			0
so we have to look to ourselves to earn the money			0
' many local people , directly or indirectly , rely on tourism for their income – just as @entity105 does			0
they also know that @entity105 has a long history of re-investing in both tourism facilities , the museum , the buses , car parking , etc , and in conservation - having spent £ 2 million in recent years on conserving the 450ft high cliffs			2
' improving the @entity19 tourism product , for the needs and expectations of the 21 @entity164 visitor , as a means to protect the natural beauty and wildlife of @entity19 for future generations to enjoy , is what we have been doing and what we want to continue to do			2
' mr @entity86 is planning to make a formal planning application next spring and hopes for it to be operational in spring 2016			0
@entity173 suggests the @entity19 cable car would be similar to that used for the last 30 years at the @entity176 , in @entity177 , @entity178 , pictured above			1

@entity11 wants to attract more visitors to @entity19
but the conservation body says the proposal will blight its beauty
