most photographers would be happy to capture a beautiful sunset or sunrise			1
but for one artist , that was n't enough - so he decided to show the world 's most iconic cityscapes by day and night - in just one picture			2
the mesmerising images show the beautiful transition from day to night in some of the world 's most iconic cities from the @entity13 skyline to @entity15 's @entity14			2
@entity16 in @entity15 is given a fresh new look in just one picture			0
the mesmerising image show the beautiful transition from day to night @entity20 is one of the 15 images that show how the city 's character changes over time @entity26 in @entity15 was snapped by photographer @entity27 who spends up to 15 hours to create just one composite image @entity29 in @entity30 has two very difference sides as this images shows - from the bright sandy beach with blue waves hitting the shore in the day to a bustling , illuminated pier at night the unusual images were taken by photographer @entity27 who spent up to 15 hours and shot up to 1500 photos to create just one composite image			1
the collection entitled day to @entity40 features 15 images including works from @entity16 , the @entity43 and the @entity44			1
to create the images , @entity46 , 55 , from @entity47 , @entity48 , shoots across the entire landscape from sunrise to sunset			1
he then returns to his studio to blend around 50 of the best photographs to create one seamless image			1
each piece takes around one month to edit			2
@entity56 , @entity57 : although the crowds remain the same , the photographer captured the beauty of the changing light the @entity43 is one of @entity64 's most iconic images - and now this composition shows just how important it is to the city the @entity68 in @entity15 is one of the city 's most photographed spots and this image shows its look changes during the course of just one day the @entity75 in @entity15 looks like it 's dividing two different cities in this composition @entity46 said he first came up with the idea of shooting multiple images across a landscape when taking the cast picture for @entity84 's blockbuster @entity82 for @entity85 , in 1996			1
but it was n't until he was asked to shoot the @entity68 for @entity87 that @entity46 used this technique to show the passing of time			0
@entity46 said while he is fascinated by architecture , people and the cities of the world , what he really loves to shoot is history			0
and he has even shot @entity98 images of president @entity100 's inauguration speech as well as @entity101 in @entity16			0
there are currently 15 images in the collection but he is currently working on images from @entity106 , and hope to add works from @entity108 and @entity109 in the near future			2
@entity46 wants to add as many images as possible to his collection			0
no matter what time of the day it is , @entity15 is always heaving with people and always alight with adverts @entity14 in @entity15 shows how the beautiful and busy park can turn spookily quiet in the evening			0
mr @entity27 frst came up with the idea of shooting multiple images across a landscape when taking the cast picture for @entity84 's blockbuster @entity82 @entity123 in @entity15 looks like the scene of a blockbuster as the dark sky looms over the avenue that sees taxis race up and down the road a wintry @entity14 looks crisp and bright - until the sun sets and a dark grey shadow is cast over the sprawling public space @entity134 is caught between the day and the night as part of mr wilkes unique way of capturing scenes he said : ' i remember saying that @entity15 was very active and busy at lunchtime and very spooky at night			1
' i like to say it 's a labour of love for you to stay 15 hours and shoot 1500 images where most of the time there is no bathroom			1
' i am a street photographer by training and day to @entity40 is essentially all the things i love about photography ; my son describes it as my symphony			1
' the images are so layered ; there are so many elements that i love about the medium : street , history , people environment , narrative , and storytelling			0
' i 'm drawn to cities that have not only fantastic architecture , but also fascinating street life			0
' the human narrative is the subtext is in a lot of my photographs , so more you look at it , the more you are going to discover			0
' there is a layered effect so you will discover something new whenever you view it			0
