by @entity0 published : 04:58 est , 6 june 2013 updated : 19:47 est , 6 june 2013 @entity3 could spy on @entity5 citizens and firms through its supply of broadband equipment to @entity5 telecoms giants , @entity2 ’s intelligence watchdog has warned			1
mps on the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) said they had serious concerns about the internet deals signed by @entity14 and @entity15 with the @entity3 telecoms firm @entity16			1
@entity3 could ‘ intercept covertly or disrupt traffic passing through @entity16 - supplied networks ’ , their report said , adding that oversight of the firm in the @entity5 is ‘ feeble ’ and suffers from the ‘ absence of any strategy ’			1
security risk : @entity3 hackers could use weaknesses in equipment sold to @entity5 firms as an espionage opportunity , mps said @entity16 supplies mobile handsets , routers and equipment in telephone exchanges and street cabinets to a string of @entity5 telecoms companies			1
so scathing was the report that @entity39 , the chancellor , yesterday took the unusual step of issuing a statement in response to the @entity11 ’s findings , stressing the importance of @entity3 investment in @entity5			1
clearly anticipating a diplomatic row , he said : ‘ inward investment is critical to generating @entity5 jobs and growth			0
it is a personal priority of mine to increase trade links between the @entity5 and @entity3 and i can not emphasise enough that the @entity5 is open to @entity3 investment			1
’ the @entity25 ’ report even called for staff from the @entity56 listening agency to take over the running of @entity16 ’s cyber security evaluation centre which it built in @entity59 , @entity60			0
failings : the @entity11 , chaired by sir @entity62 , said government action to address concerns had been unaccceptable @entity16 secured a contract with @entity14 eight years ago as part of the £ 2.5billion super-fast broadband deal to supply two - thirds of @entity5 homes and companies by 2015			1
the @entity3 firm has also signed deals with @entity15 , @entity73 and @entity74			1
national security concerns were sidelined in favour of money as the @entity3 had managed to undercut local companies for the contracts , the report said			2
members of the @entity11 were ‘ shocked ’ that ministers were not even informed about the @entity14 deal until a year after it was signed			1
chairman sir @entity62 said : ‘ such a sensitive decision with potentially damaging implications should have been handed to ministers			0
a lack of clarity around procedures , responsibility and powers means that national security issues have risked , and continue to risk , being overlooked			0
’ ahead of the report ’s publication , members of the committee had warned that it would be heavily censored because of the @entity100 and @entity101 ’s fears of scaring away @entity3 investors – claims denied by @entity104			2
relations with @entity3 have been strained since @entity106 agreed to meet the @entity107 , @entity108 ’s spiritual leader , last year			0
granting him an audience was seen by @entity111 as a terrible snub to @entity3 ’s sovereignty over @entity108			0
in its last annual report , the @entity11 said that a fifth of detected cyber attacks against the @entity5 were so sophisticated that they had to be state sponsored or part of an organised crime ring			2
@entity3 is often cited as one of the main perpetrators of state - sponsored cyber attacks			2
suspicions : questions have been raised about whether @entity16 's intentions were ' strictly commercial or are more political ' a spokesman for @entity16 said it was ‘ willing to work with all governments in a completely open and transparent manner to jointly reduce the risk of cyber security			0
’ in a statement @entity14 said : ‘ security is at the heart of @entity14 and it will continue to be so in the future			0
‘ our testing regime enables us to enjoy constructive relationships with many suppliers across the globe			0
one of these is @entity16 , with whom we have had a long and constructive relationship since 2005			0

@entity11 raises concerns about @entity16
@entity3 telecoms giant has *multi-billion* pound deals with @entity14 and *02*
@entity150 *voiced* fears about links with @entity3 state a decade ago
