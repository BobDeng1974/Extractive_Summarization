if you 've ever bitten into deep fried ice cream , you might have experienced a taste and texture that was out of this world - in more ways than one			1
that 's because , according to @entity13 , the structure of @entity9 - which @entity12 's @entity11 spacecraft is currently orbiting - resembles the popular dessert			1
in an experiment , they found that while the exterior of a comet is encased in a hard , outer crust , the interior would mostly be fluffy ice			1
@entity13 scientists in @entity23 say comets are like deep fried ice cream			1
the analogy was made after an experiment on @entity28 called @entity29 looked at how comets evolve over time			1
it suggests they have a hard exterior but a soft and fluffy interior			1
shown is a mosaic of comet @entity37 taken by @entity11 on 3 february 2015 ' a comet is like deep fried ice cream , ' said dr @entity40 of @entity13 's @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity23 , corresponding author of a recent study appearing in the @entity45			1
' the crust is made of crystalline ice , while the interior is colder and more porous			1
' the organics are like a final layer of chocolate on top			0
' @entity12 's @entity11 spacecraft launched on 2 march 2004 aboard an ariane 5 rocket , on a mission to visit comet @entity56			0
it took more than ten years to reach the comet , and on the way it flew past @entity61 and two asteroids			0
on 6 august 2014 it entered orbit around the comet , beginning a series of complex manoeuvres to get the best views possible			0
on 12 november 2014 @entity11 successfully released a smaller vehicle it had carried called @entity70			2
this small probe bounced twice on the surface before coming to rest			0
although @entity70 's landing did not go as planned , it was still able to complete more than 90 per cent of the science it was intended to do before its main batteries died , sending the probe to sleep			0
the location of the lander is currently unknown			0
it is thought to be in partial shadow near a cliff but , as the comet approaches the sun , the additional light may charge its solar panels enough for the lander to wake up			0
@entity11 , meanwhile , is continuing its mission around the comet			0
@entity93 is approaching the sun and , by august this year , it is thought its activity will have dramatically increased			0
this will release much more ice , vapour and other materials from the surface - and @entity11 will be there to watch it all happen			2
to come to the conclusion , astronomers used an icebox - like instrument nicknamed @entity29			1
they showed that fluffy ice on the surface of a comet would crystallise and harden as the comet heads towards the sun and warms up			2
while researchers had already known that comets had soft interiors and hard crusts , based on data from @entity11 , their exact composition and how they formed had remained unclear			1
in this study , the researchers used labs on @entity28 to model how a comet 's crust crystallised			2
the experiments began with amorphous , or porous , ice - the proposed composition of the coldest comets and icy moons			2
in this state , water vapour molecules are flash - frozen at extremely cold temperatures of around 30 @entity130 ( -243 ° @entity131 )			2
this preserves disorderly states in the comet , so water molecules are mixed with other molecules , like organics , and remain frozen			0
according to dr @entity40 , amorphous ice is like cotton candy - light and fluffy , and filled with pockets of space			2
the researchers then used the @entity29 cryostat instrument to slowly warm their amorphous ice mixtures from 30 @entity130 to 150 @entity130			1
this mimicked the conditions a comet would experience as it journeys towards the sun. the ice was also infused with a type of organics , called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , or @entity155 , which are common in space , to mimic the composition of the comet			2
to come to the conclusion that comets are like deep fried ice cream ( stock image left ) , astronomers used an icebox - like instrument nicknamed @entity29 ( right )			1
they showed that fluffy ice on the surface of a comet would crystallise and harden as the comet heads towards the sun and warms up while researchers had already known that comets had soft interiors and hard crusts , based on data from @entity11 , their exact composition and how they formed had remained unclear			1
shown is a mosaic of comet @entity37 taken by @entity11 on 31 january 2015 , with jets of vapour being expelled from the surface how did water come to exist on our planet ? most scientists are of the opinion that it did n't begin here on @entity28 , instead being transported from elsewhere in the solar system , but whether it came from an asteroid or a comet was a mystery			1
that was one of the key questions @entity12 was hoping the @entity11 mission would solve when it arrived at comet @entity9 in august , and it mayn now have an answer			0
using the @entity200 for @entity201 and @entity202 - or @entity203 - the spacecraft ' sniffed ' the comet 's atmosphere as it remained in orbit and analysed its composition			0
it found that water in the comet 's atmosphere had a different ratio of deuterium - to - hydrogen than water on @entity28			1
the results were seemingly confirmed by the @entity70 lander on the surface			0
however , some scientists have pointed out that not all comets are the same - and others may match the water on @entity28			1
the debate over whether asteroids or comets brought water to @entity28 - or even both - looks set to continue for the foreseeable future			1
the results came as a surprise			0
' the @entity155 stuck together and were expelled from the ice host as it crystallised , ' said dr @entity231 of @entity232			0
' this may be the first observation of molecules clustering together due to a phase transition of ice , and this certainly has many important consequences for the chemistry and physics of ice			0
' with @entity155 kicked out of the ice mixtures , the water molecules had room to link up and form the more tightly packed structures of crystalline ice			2
' what we saw in the lab - a crystalline comet crust with organics on top - matches what has been suggested from observations in space , ' said dr @entity40			0
' deep fried ice cream is really the perfect analogy , because the interior of the comets should still be very cold and contain the more porous , amorphous ice			1
' the composition of comets is important to understanding how they might have delivered water and organics to the young , hot @entity28			1
new results from the @entity11 mission show that asteroids may have been the primary carriers of life 's ingredients ; however , the debate is ongoing and comets may have played a role			2
for dr @entity40 , comets are capsules containing clues not only to our planet 's history but to the birth of our entire solar system			0
' it 's beautiful to think about how far we have come in our understanding of comets			0
future missions designed to bring cold samples of comets back to @entity28 could allow us to fully unravel their secrets , ' he said .			1

@entity13 scientists in @entity23 say comets are like deep fried ice cream
the analogy was made after an experiment on @entity28 simulated comets
called @entity29 it looked at how they evolve over time
it suggest they have a hard exterior but a soft and fluffy interior
results could help *explain* how water was brought to the young @entity28
