hands off in the box is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box			1
whether it is wrestling , grappling , shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the @entity10 vs @entity12 match - the area has become a free - for - all for cheating			1
and that means fewer goals in the @entity16			1
for too long , referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring			0
it 's time to end that			0
so join us in our campaign to say @entity24 to players and referees			2
we ’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it			0
@entity16 penalty boxes are starting to look more like @entity33 wrestling rings as defenders blatantly cheat to stop attackers scoring goals from set pieces			1
sunday 's clash of the titans at @entity40 produced the most outrageous example yet seen			1
@entity42 took @entity43 in a headlock while @entity45 did the same to @entity46 before dragging him to the ground			0
both @entity10 defenders went unpunished			1
but this is by no means an isolated incident and @entity50 has launched a new campaign to rid football of the dark arts in the penalty area			1
referees and assistants need to toughen up - they can see these fouls but choose not to punish them because they do not want to give away multiple penalties per match			1
but that is not good enough			0
@entity61 and wrestling inside the box must be stamped out , just as tackles from behind have been and reckless challenges are being now			1
guilty defenders must be named and shamed - if everyone knows who the cheats are , referees will have no excuse not to punish serial offenders			1
so , here is a rogues gallery nominated by @entity50 's experts			1
the players below are those who we consider the worst offenders in the game			2
but unfortunately they are still just the tip of the iceberg			0
nominate your prime suspects by using the comments section below ... @entity46 and @entity45 wrestle in the box during @entity10 's draw with @entity12 but that was not the only incident at the same set piece , with @entity43 and @entity42 also grappling ( right ) @entity90 ( @entity91 ) no player has conceded more penalties in the @entity16 in the past five years			1
as good and decent as he is , the @entity91 defender is one of the worst offenders			2
he ’s being targeted by officials now and was correctly punished when he held @entity98 striker @entity97 at a corner			0
@entity100 @entity91 's @entity90 ( right ) did concede a penalty for this grapple with @entity98 's @entity97 last week @entity103 ( @entity104 ) i would say the @entity104 defender has turned this in to an art form if he was n’t so bad at it			2
@entity110 @entity104 's @entity103 has also been penalised in the past for penalty area blocking @entity113 ( @entity114 ) arguably the finest defender in the @entity16 after @entity43 , @entity116 is a brute			1
he operates on the edge – just ask @entity119 , who the @entity120 ‘ monstered ’ in the 2013 @entity122 semi-final ( below )			0
watch him as @entity91 defend their next corner , he ’ll be all over his man			0
@entity125 @entity113 nearly tears the shirt off @entity119 during the @entity122 semi-final at @entity129 in 2013 @entity103 ( @entity104 ) i would n't say he is the worst in the @entity16 but it does not go unnoticed how often @entity104 's @entity132 central defender grapples with opponents at set pieces			1
there 's nothing wrong with being combative but one of these days @entity103 may find himself being penalised			0
@entity137 @entity103 ( @entity104 ) @entity138 felt he and @entity139 got away with a lot at @entity104			0
with @entity139 gone , @entity103 is the standard bearer			0
@entity143 - @entity142 @entity103 ( second left ) grabs hold of @entity146 defender per @entity148 's shirt at a set piece in february @entity43 ( @entity12 ) the @entity12 captain will do just about anything to clear his lines and make it hard for the opposition and this often means resorting to the dark arts			1
but you do n’t become the @entity16 ’s best defender without working out how to get away with it			1
@entity160 @entity43 ( second left ) wrestles with @entity42 during sunday 's clash at @entity40 @entity162 ( @entity163 ) @entity164 rightly awarded a spot - kick when the @entity163 captain rugby - tackled @entity168 ’s @entity167 to the floor last month			1
@entity170 spared his blushes with a fine penalty save that day but @entity162 is a serial offender			1
@entity173 @entity174 ( @entity10 ) cynical defending was about the only thing @entity174 contributed to @entity10 's cause during his first year at @entity40			1
let 's have more spectacular goals like the strike at @entity180 last week rather than all that ugly shirt - pulling , please			2
@entity183 @entity174 ( centre right ) uses his arm to challenge @entity187 's @entity186 last season @entity103 ( @entity104 ) he is all about the physical side of the game but takes it too far defending corners and free kicks			0
@entity103 barely ever looks at the ball and rarely does he not have a chunk of his opponent 's shirt in his hand			0
he 's been doing it week - in - week - out since he joined the @entity16 in 2008			1
@entity200 @entity202 goalkeeper @entity201 attempts to catch the ball while @entity103 uses his arms to try and stop him @entity205 ( @entity187 ) the physical defender gives as good as he gets in the box , and then some			2
@entity208 loves blocking in the area in every sense of the word , including @entity91 goalkeeper @entity214 's eyeline in 2013			2
@entity215 @entity216 ( @entity217 ) not the quickest over five yards , @entity218 gains an advantage when defending corners by blocking off from set pieces			2
more of a wrestler than shirt - puller , the @entity217 captain consistently gets away with impeding strikers unfairly , often grasping an opponent ’s upper arm to haul them back			2
@entity228 @entity46 ( @entity12 ) the defender got a taste of his own medicine at the weekend			2
@entity46 may be playing the victim right now but he ’s mastered the dark arts of defending			1
just look at the picture below			0
@entity235 @entity148 ( yes , him again ) has his shorts tugged by @entity46 during a corner at @entity238 in october - and fellow @entity12 defender @entity239 ( left ) grabs hold of the @entity242 's torso for good measure @entity43 ( @entity12 ) one of the main offenders for the last decade or so , @entity43 loves a tug on an opponent 's shirt			1
grappling for space in the area ready to ' defend ' a set - piece , the @entity12 centre back has long evaded punishment for being heavy - handed in the penalty box			1
@entity254 @entity255 ( @entity163 ) when the @entity256 arrived at @entity146 he was notable as much for his ‘ defending ’ at corners as his ( limited ) goal - threat			2
since working under @entity261 and now @entity262 at @entity163 , his proficiency at the dark arts has only increased			1
rarely seen at a set piece without a handful of shirt			2
@entity266 @entity267 tries to escape the clutches of @entity163 forward @entity255 ( right ) @entity43 , @entity12 captain ‘ me and @entity46 were double headlocked at every corner			2
’ @entity270 , @entity104 assistant manager ‘ grappling			0
that is the new word is it ? it is the referees ’ interpretation and we ’ll leave it to them			0
that ’s what the referees and the officials are paid for			0
so whatever they decide is grappling , or holding , it ’s in their hands really			2
did i do it as player ? no , i was a winger and did n’t have to mark anyone			0
’ @entity292 , @entity293 striker ‘ there should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set - pieces			1
it was like @entity299 in the @entity10 area			1
’ @entity301 , former top referee ‘ hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned			0
once fans , managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal , this campaign will have achieved its aims			0
’ @entity309 , @entity293 defender ‘ defenders are checking , blocking , holding , grappling , using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place			0
’ @entity317 , @entity318 manager ‘ in a congested area how can you judge if someone ’s been blocked ? it ’s part of the game and some people are good at it			0
a local @entity338 referee came in and he was asking me about it			0
“ can you show me some blocking techniques ? ” that was great , he was trying to find ways of detecting it			0
the confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free - kicks , but the same wo n’t be given as penalties			1
there has to be consistency			0
’ and the readers of @entity344 ... ‘ it ’s more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves			0
it ’s about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players			0
’ @entity352 , @entity353 ‘ to those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties , that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop			0
i ’ve been watching football since the @entity363 and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst i ’ve ever seen			1
’ sir @entity366 , @entity368 like our @entity10 facebook page here .			2

@entity50 has launched a campaign to rid football of the dark arts in the penalty area : hands off in the box
@entity12 were denied a penalty despite clear fouls by @entity10 defenders in shocking incident at @entity40 on sunday
but wrestling at set - pieces is a wider *problem* in the @entity16
there are serial offenders at many clubs who keep getting away with it
