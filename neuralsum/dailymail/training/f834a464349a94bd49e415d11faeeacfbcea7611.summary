he first hit the headlines in the early nineties with his books the @entity13 and @entity14 , which claimed that a diet rich in salmon and berries could help you look younger in just three days			0
and now , the man himself has teamed up with @entity21 to bring his service to your front door			2

this anti-inflammatory diet , which is rich in lean proteins , antioxidants and essential fatty acids , is said to be followed by celebrities such as @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45			1
dr @entity1 believes that wrinkles , lines , puffiness and sagging are a symptom of ‘ inflammation ’ at cellular level , caused by poor diet , overexposure to sun , air pollution , and other modern - day skin irritants			1
his plan counteracts premature ageing by directly reducing cell level inflammation through a special diet high in omega oils and other nutritional wonder - foods , as opposed to @entity64 and surgery			0
foods in his diet include salmon , tuna , turkey , olive oil , nuts , fresh fruits , vegetables and herbs			2
one of the key ingredients in the food basket , which starts from £ 80 , is salmon , which contains essential fatty acids that help to dramatically reduce puffiness , increase radiance and add firmness to the skin			1
dr @entity1 is so convinced by the power of salmon , he recommends you eat it twice a day , but you may substitute it for poultry or tofu if necessary			1
youth is one click away : @entity21 is introducing a @entity1 food basket , which means with just a few clicks all the ingredients can be added to your basket and delivered together in your chosen time slot famous fans : youthful @entity42 and @entity43 are said to be big fans of dr @entity1 's diet but does it work ? @entity105 , @entity106 , said : ' my initial concern with this diet is the amount of salmon dr @entity1 suggests is consumed to achieve results			1
' @entity114 advice says males and women past child - bearing age ( or those who will not conceive ) may consume up to four portions of oily fish per week			0
women of child - bearing age should only consume up to two portions of oily fish per week			0
' this is because of the levels of pollutants found in oily fish , especially the heavy metal mercury which is toxic			0
as a nutritionist i would therefore not recommend someone eat this much salmon for any kind of diet			0
' if they wanted to achieve the same effect , they are better off eating two portions per week and then taking a high quality fish oil supplement which is certified as being clean from heavy metals and other contaminants			0
' the rest of the diet is actually really good - particularly almonds , berries and plant oils such as olive oil - think how good @entity146 skin often looks			0
