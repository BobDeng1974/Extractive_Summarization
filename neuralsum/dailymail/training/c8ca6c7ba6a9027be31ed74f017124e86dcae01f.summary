by @entity1 reporter last updated at 8:46 pm on 30th september 2011 a document obtained by the @entity3 shows for the first time how the four largest cellphone companies in the @entity6 treat data about their subscribers ' calls , text messages , web surfing and approximate locations			1
the one - page document from the @entity15 's cybercrime division shows , for instance , that @entity17 keeps for one year information about which cell towers subscriber phones connect to			1
that data that can be used to figure out where the phone has been , down to the level of a neighborhood			1
@entity26 has kept the same data since july 2008			1
a new document obtained by @entity3 revealed the varying degrees to which cell phone companies keep users information			1
@entity33 does n't keep any information on web browsing activity the sheet is a guide for law enforcement , which can request the information from the carriers through legal channels			2
where 's @entity43 ? data stored by the phone companies can track movement down to a specific neighborhood the @entity49 section of the @entity3 obtained it through a @entity51 request , the @entity3 said			1
@entity52 reported earlier about the document , which is dated aug. 2010			2
the document was released by the @entity3 wednesday , but has been hiding in plain sight on the website of the @entity59 public defender 's office			1
it can be found there through a @entity63 search , but only if the searcher knows the exact title of the document			2
a few data points from the sheet were known outside law enforcement circles , but wireless carriers have not been open about their policies			0
they are n't required to keep the data , and they keep the same information for varying lengths of time			2
some do n't keep data at all that other companies store			0
for instance , it says @entity33 does n't keep any information on web browsing activity			2
@entity17 , on the other hand , keeps some information for up to a year that can be used to ascertain if a particular phone visited a particular web site			1
according to the sheet , @entity92 's @entity91 brand keeps the text content of text messages for three months			2
@entity17 keeps it for three to five days			0
none of the other carriers keep texts at all , but they keep records of who texted who for more than a year			1
the document says @entity26 keeps for five to seven years a record of who text messages who - and when , but not the content of the messages			1
@entity91 only keeps that data for two to three months			0
the carriers do n't have recordings of calls , but keep information about calls that are made and received for at least a year			0
the @entity3 said it believes people have a right to know how long phone companies keep records of their activities			1
although the sheet is dated august 2010 , @entity121 , a private investigator specializing in cellphone data , said it is still accurate			0
@entity92 spokesman @entity125 said he could n't comment on the specific figures in the sheet			0
normally , he said , a subpoena , court order , or customer consent form from a recognized law enforcement agency is necessary for the carrier to hand out data			0
people who have @entity26 should be aware , the @entity3 believes , that data on who and when they text is kept by the company for 5 - 7 years however , @entity92 also responds to emergency requests , as in missing persons cases , if the police can document their need , he said			1
the @entity15 did not immediately respond to a request for comment			0
a bill in @entity147 would force wired internet service providers to keep records of the network addresses assigned to each subscriber for 18 months			0
that would help investigators link online activity to specific homes			0
but the bill does n't apply to wireless links			0
a series of such bills have been proposed over the years , but have n't passed .			0
