@entity1 's lawyer has dismissed his clients apparent confession during the final seconds of @entity6 's @entity5 docudrama and said the unguarded comments could be interpreted in a 100 different ways			1
the six part series concluded last sunday with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live			0
of course , ' @entity1 was heard to mumble to himself			1
there is speculation that @entity1 's explosive comments could be used against him in court , but attorney @entity40 said they prove nothing			1
' there 's one hundred ways of interpreting it ... one of ' em being very shakespearean			1
the soliloquy , ' he told 48 hours			0
famously used by @entity51 in a number of his plays , a soliloquy is an act of speaking one 's thoughts aloud when by oneself or regardless of any hearers			2
for instance @entity59 's ' to be or not to be ' speech			0
' if you are a student of @entity51 , as i am , you 'll understand that what i 'm talking about , ' said @entity40			2
he said he first heard @entity1 's recorded comments ' along with the rest of @entity66 ' when it was broadcast last sunday			1
@entity40 , the lead attorney on @entity1 's team , has compared his client 's apparant confession to a @entity72 soliloquy and claims that it could be interpreted in a hundred different ways the lawyer also said that it is well know that @entity1 talks to himself and ' that 's just one of his quirks			1
' ' there are people who feel like he got set up			0
... my daughter 's a journalist , and she was outraged at what @entity83 and his producers pulled			1
' @entity40 also said he was ' astonished ' that @entity1 was interviewed by @entity87 prosecutors for three hours without his lawyer present after his arrest last saturday			1
' @entity90 is not sophisticated , he is intelligent , he 's got @entity91 's , ' said @entity40 explaining why his client had n't simply refused to speak until he had his counsil present			1
@entity40 filled court papers on friday in which he claims @entity1 was illegally arrested on charges that he murdered a woman in @entity98 , as well as drug and weapons charges filed in @entity31			1
in the papers filed at the @entity102 in @entity31 , @entity103 and @entity40 asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep @entity1 jailed			1
they argue that he should be released			0
' i think he 's an easy target and everybody 's piling on			0
... they 're gon na find nothing , ' @entity40 , the lead attorney on @entity1 's team , told @entity117			1
@entity40 also accused @entity83 , the director of @entity5 , right , of setting up @entity1 ' i think @entity118 and their elected officials want a piece of the publicity pie			1
' the judge agreed to schedule that hearing during another court appearance by @entity1 on monday in @entity31			2
the attorneys also asked the judge to order that evidence be preserved from the hotel where @entity1 was arrested			2
they are seeking any and all records related to @entity1 and @entity131 , the pseudonym @entity1 used to check into the hotel			2
the documents blasted the arrest , which the attorneys say was orchestrated ' to coincide with the final episode of the @entity6 docudrama @entity138			1
@entity1 , a member of a wealthy @entity140 real estate family , was charged with murder in @entity98 for the december 2000 shooting death of @entity35			2
@entity1 's arrest came shortly before the @entity6 finale about his links to three killings â€” that of his first wife , who disappeared in @entity140 in 1982 ; @entity35 , the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared ; and a 71 - year - old neighbor in @entity154 whose dismembered body was found floating in @entity156 in 2001			1
@entity157 : @entity1 is on suicide watch at a @entity118 detention center			2
he is expected to appear in court on monday @entity1 has only ever been tried for the @entity154 killing , and he was acquitted of murder			2
@entity1 waived extradition in @entity31 but he is being held there on charges that he was a felon in possession of a gun and with illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled substance			2
court documents say investigators found nearly $ 43,000 in cash , a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his hotel room when he was arrested			0
authorities have also said marijuana was found in the room			0
however , @entity1 's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge			1
he has been charged in @entity87 with first - degree murder in the 2000 killing @entity35 , the daughter of a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in @entity140 in 1982			0
@entity1 , 71 , who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $ 4 billion , has long denied killing @entity35 and @entity193 , who was declared dead even though her body was never found			2
investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with @entity35 when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near @entity200			0
after the killing , @entity1 disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap @entity156 , @entity154 , boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001			1
he claimed self - defense and was acquitted of murder but was convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man 's body , which was found chopped up and floating in @entity156			0
while legal experts said @entity1 's remarks off - camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible , prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing			1
' i would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials , ' said @entity224 , a former prosecutor and professor at @entity226			0
' the flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face			0
' in the case of @entity232 , prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with @entity237 because it contradicted other evidence			0
the defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview			0
' it did a great deal both to humanize him and so he was n't just seen as a celebrity , ' said @entity246 , who won @entity232 's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife			0
' there was an image projected that a lot of people had about @entity1 as a difficult person			0
in this video , he came across as a very sympathetic person			0
' prosecutors are not commenting on the @entity35 case while @entity1 is still held in @entity118 , where he also faces firearms charges .			0
