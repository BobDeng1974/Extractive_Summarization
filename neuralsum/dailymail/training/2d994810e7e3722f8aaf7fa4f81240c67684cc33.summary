by @entity0 a ‘ miracle ’ baby who was born at just 24 weeks and spent the first year of his life in hospital is finally thriving			1
doctors would not have attempted to save @entity6 , who weighed less than 1lb 5oz when he was born , if his birth had come just days earlier			1

@entity6 was born at 24 weeks weighing just 1lb 5oz and his parents , @entity8 and @entity9 , were warned he might not survive			1
they family are pictured with nurse @entity15 ( back ) ‘ on friday 13 , in july 2012 , she started bleeding and lost a clot and we actually thought it was the baby			2
’ the panic - stricken couple called an ambulance which took them to @entity10 ’s @entity22			2
it was n’t until they were at the hospital that they were told the baby was still safe			2
mrs @entity27 was given two lots of steroid injections to help develop @entity31 ’s lungs in case he made an early arrival			2
‘ it was a massive relief to find out that the baby was ok , ’ said mr @entity6			2
‘ we actually also found out that @entity9 was 2cm dilated			2
’ @entity6 was born on july 16 , 2012 , at just 24 weeks and three days as doctors could not halt mrs @entity27 ’s labour			1
@entity6 was born at just 24 weeks and three days at the @entity22 in @entity10 , as doctors could not halt his mother 's labour mr @entity6 said : ‘ they said to us that the baby would be out in 24 hours			1
they also said that the baby might not make it through			0
‘ they had to give him oxygen to try and make him breathe			0
‘ three minutes into doing it we heard a little cry			0
‘ it was just overwhelming as everything had been quiet up until that point			0
‘ it was like looking at @entity56			0
it was just a little miracle that he was there			0
’ @entity6 was rushed for neonatal intensive care and spent 15 weeks there before being discharged			1
after a year in hospital , @entity31 has finally been allowed to go home and he is now learning to walk and talk however , he was back within days due because he developed a chest infection			1
investigations also found he had a hole in his heart which meant he required an operation at @entity70 ’s @entity69 in december before he could return to @entity71			1

‘ we were actually told to prepare ourselves for the worst , ’ said mr @entity6			2
‘ they did say to us that we might have to make a choice to leave the machine on or turn it off			0
‘ but we thought “ it ’s a life and we ’re in it for the long term ”			0
’ thankfully , @entity6 responded well to treatment and by march he was starting to be prepared for his release from hospital which finally took place on july 3 , 2013			1
mrs @entity27 said : ‘ to look at him you would n’t know the problems he has had			0
you would think he was a “ normal ” 18 - month - old			0
‘ he ’s crawling and he can hold himself up on his feet			0
‘ he ’ll say “ mum ” and “ dad ”			0
we are just so proud of him			0

@entity6 's mother *suddenly* went into *premature* labour at 24 weeks
if he *'d* been born just a few days earlier , doctors would not have attempted to save him and his birth would have been *classed* as a *miscarriage*
he spent 15 weeks in neonatal intensive care before being released
he then developed a chest infection and had to return to intensive care
he also had to have surgery to close a hole in his heart
later , he nearly died when he developed a lower respiratory tract infection
he was finally released from hospital in july 2013 and is now thriving
