a leading @entity1 mp has raised the prospect of cuts to pensioner benefits			1
piling pressure on both @entity7 and @entity8 to accept reductions in handouts for wealthy pensioners , dame @entity5 said it would make sense to reform the welfare system so that more generous benefits are paid to fewer people			1
her intervention is significant because @entity1 politicians tend to defend the principle of universal welfare payments such as winter fuel allowance and other perks such as free bus passes and television licences for the elderly			1
reduction : suggestions are piling pressure on both @entity7 and @entity8 to accept reductions in handouts for wealthy pensioners changes : dame @entity5 said it would make sense to reform the welfare system the prime minister has ruled out any move to means - test these benefits before the general election in 2015			1
but a growing chorus of @entity41 voices , privately supported by @entity43 @entity42 , and the @entity44 have said it is unfair to cut working - age benefits while rich pensioners continue to get state handouts			2
asked if the benefits system should evolve so that more generous payments are paid to fewer people , @entity49 told the today programme on @entity53 : ‘ yes			2
i do n’t think there ’s any doubt about that			0
the biggest growth in welfare spend is on people who are over pension age			2
‘ because of the demographics , there are more of them and they ’re living longer , and that ’s where a lot of the costs have come in			0
’ asked whether cutting pensioner benefits should be on the table to save money and reform the system , @entity49 , a disability rights campaigner , said : ‘ the problem is in the debate			2
‘ we forget that the pensioners are part of the welfare system			0
pensioners do n’t like to think that their state pension is a benefit			0
but they are part of the overall cost of the welfare system			0
’ one third of state spending goes on welfare payments , and around half of that budget goes on pensioners			1
dame @entity49 said : ‘ the statistic about one in every three pounds that the government spends going on welfare includes all of the money spent on people over pensionable age			0
’ asked whether she would like to see a @entity1 government limit the scope of pensioner benefits , she said she did not have ‘ the seniority ’ to ‘ be able to make policy ’ for the party			1
but for someone who has campaigned against benefit cuts for some people of working age to even voice the idea that some pensioners should get less suggests a growing consensus that wealthy elderly people are likely to be targeted after the election .			0
