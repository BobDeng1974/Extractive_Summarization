there is so much resting on wednesday ’s return leg between @entity2 and @entity3			2
the vast torrent of money which flows into a club ’s financial reservoirs for progression			2
the job security of both @entity10 and @entity11			2
the fascinating battle of pride and self - respect between @entity16 and @entity17 football			0
might it become part of all of @entity21 ’s representatives exiting the @entity22 before the quarter - finals ? @entity24 ( left ) and @entity25 have been two legends of @entity22 football over the past decade @entity25 could be playing his final @entity22 game if he faces @entity2 on wednesday @entity25 has been on the fringes of the @entity3 team since extending his loan spell the culture clash is slighter than usual given that @entity3 are self - acknowledged pretenders to the @entity2 crown			1
development , passing style , player selection , executive stewardship — they want to squeeze the best out of what @entity41 , @entity42 and then @entity43 instilled in the @entity46 club , but with added @entity48 steel , organisation , petro - dollar resources and hungry , aspirational fans			0
however , the @entity22 is a wider tasting plate than that			1
this is where ‘ the greats ’ measure themselves			0
and , sadly , two of the all - time @entity59 greats , @entity24 and @entity25 , face the prospect of arriving at the @entity61 at about 7.30pm @entity16 time , not being listed in the starting @entity63 ... then one of them leaving in the knowledge that that was their last ever night in the competition			1
@entity24 is a club legend at @entity2 , but has also become increasingly a fringe player this season when he has played , @entity24 is still providing assists , and is a vital part of the set - up off the pitch too @entity24 , who @entity2 ’s managing director was trying to sell when i arrived in this city in 2002 , is the leading all - time appearance maker in the @entity22			1
thirty - eight matches ahead of the next active outfield player — @entity81			0
even if @entity81 inspired @entity82 to retain their trophy this season , then won the next two champions @entity85 consecutively , he ’d still be seven matches short of tying the @entity46			2
the 35 - year - old has three winner ’s medals , two more than @entity25 , who is a year - and - a - half older			1
but in reality , @entity24 has played precisely an hour less in @entity22 finals			1
a horrible knee injury in 2006 meant he never stepped off the bench against @entity95 when @entity2 came back from a 1 - 0 deficit and won 2 - 1 thanks to @entity98 and @entity99			0
in his other two triumphs , 2009 and 2011 , he gave fabulous goal assists for @entity103 ’s header in @entity104 and @entity106 ’s opener against @entity107 at @entity108			2
@entity25 was a different case			1
he confessed to me that after so many semi-final disappointments , following the horror of losing in @entity114 ( where he scored ) , it felt a little as if @entity116 were cursed			0
precisely the opposite of how he felt the last time he was in this stadium			0
@entity25 is due to join @entity120 club @entity119 at the end of the season , while @entity24 rejected the same move the @entity116 legend has been a @entity22 mainstay for over a decade , but could bow out this week few pick it out now but not only was his performance for @entity116 in the 2012 semi-final precisely what @entity3 require tonight from someone , his return pass to @entity129 to make it 2 - 1 was exquisite			1
@entity134 ’s thumping challenge sets @entity25 back a pace but holds it off and holds the ball			1
off - balance and facing the wrong way , he slots a delicious right - footed , slide - rule through @entity24 , @entity139 and @entity140 for @entity129 to stride on to and lob @entity141			1
one of the great assists			2
he had already done something similar in the first leg , robbing @entity103 of the ball with precisely the kind of sharp , anticipatory pressing which @entity3 have lacked across three consecutive defeats to @entity2			0
then a fabulous reverse - pass for @entity129 to set up @entity151 ’s close - range winner			0
i had the great fortune to interview @entity25 in the dressing room of the @entity155 in @entity156 about an hour after @entity116 beat @entity157 in that dramatic 120 - minute final			1
he scored his , of course			0
third taker in @entity114 , third taker in @entity156			0
@entity25 celebrates with the @entity22 after the 2012 victory over @entity157 he was cradling the cup with the big ears and told me : ‘ we ’ve been a group since the troubled times , since we beat @entity2			1
’ the @entity61 was his turning point			0
the catalyst to him finally winning this tournament			0
right now he feels stagnant , frustrated			0
why stay at @entity3 , rather than begin the season properly with @entity119 if @entity10 is n’t going to play him regularly ? it was @entity3 ’s initiative , not @entity25 ’s , to stay on beyond the initial few months which were agreed			1
his appearances since deciding to turn down moves to @entity119 , who admit they still want him to join @entity178 and @entity25 , or to @entity179 , have been limited			1
when picked , he ’s performed — goal assists in his last couple of matches			2
when not picked , he ’s been a voice for calm and reason at times when @entity11 ’s first term threatened to degenerate into chaos			0
@entity24 , as captain , played a huge role in calming stormy waters between @entity11 and @entity103 in early january when the former dropped the latter for the defeat at @entity195 and the @entity196 then , coincidentally , did n’t come in to train the following day			1
all of which followed a stand - up row between the genius and the iron - fist coach in training			0
@entity24 holds the record for most games played in the @entity22 , 38 games ahead of his nearest rival if @entity81 won the @entity22 this season and the two that follow , he 'd still be behind @entity24 i ’ve spoken to both @entity25 and @entity24 about the other			1
the @entity46 will admit that tracking his @entity17 opponent has been a nightmare			0
perpetual motion , perpetual determination to haul his team forward , make them competitive			0
@entity25 once told me that @entity21 ’s 2009 defeat to @entity218 in @entity219 , featuring him , @entity24 and @entity216 , was the first real experience in his career where one midfield simply could n’t get the ball off the other			1
it was both galling and educational to him			0
it ’s feasible that next season the two are in midfield together for @entity119			1
it very nearly happened in 2004 when @entity25 ’s agent represented @entity231			2
called to meet @entity233 at the @entity61 , it became clear that the @entity235 signing was n’t feasible but @entity233 demanded to know how he could bring @entity25 instead			2
ten years later , for @entity3 , @entity233 joined the dots			0
but when @entity24 was asked to name his best ‘ @entity21 ’ xi , it contained @entity25 — in a 3 - 5 - 2 of @entity237 : @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 ; @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity25 , @entity244 ; @entity245 , @entity246 his rationale was : ‘ he ’s one of the very few midfielders who scores a striker ’s number of goals — which is a mark of greatness — and he ’s technically excellent			1
’ and @entity24 told the @entity255 ’s @entity254 about @entity21 ’s style that it had been ‘ ... no football			2
@entity258 , boom , up top ; @entity240 , boom , up top			0
i think it ’s changing : @entity25 , @entity244 … they are players who treat the ball [ well ]			1
you see them now and you think , dammit , they are trying to play ! ’ so , however it goes on wednesday , here ’s a plea to the coaches : let them play .			2

one of these two could play their final @entity22 game this week
both @entity24 and @entity25 have been fringe players this season
both still have plenty to offer , but @entity25 is moving to @entity119
@entity24 still brings assists , but is used increasingly *infrequently*
