it took a special goal from @entity2 and an @entity4 penalty for @entity6 leaders @entity7 to claim three points from west @entity10 rivals @entity9 at @entity11			1
@entity12 returned from injury after four games out but it was @entity2 's stunner that gave the hosts the lead in the 32nd minute			1
@entity9 equalised via a clever @entity20 finish threatening a draw in @entity23 's first derby against @entity9 , but @entity4 was on hand to secure the win in the 75th minute			1
@entity27 's @entity26 was at @entity11 and rates the players ' performances			2
@entity2 was the main man for @entity7 with a stunning strike and continues to improve with each appearance @entity7 @entity33 - 6.5 very , very little to do , but questionable whether he should have punched for the @entity9 equaliser			1
other than that , caught well , organised the back four and was quick to distribute			2
@entity37 - 7 guilty of missing an early sitter , but was solid defensively			2
@entity40 did n’t get any change out of the @entity42 and was n’t able to affect proceedings			2
@entity44 - 7 strong in the air and - as ever - assured when coming out of the back four			2
helped that @entity9 only opted for one up front , but you can only dominate what ’s put in front of you			1
@entity37 ( left ) missed an earlier sitter but did n't allow @entity9 's @entity40 ( right ) any joy @entity53 - 7 see @entity44			1
calm and assured but for one moment in the first half when @entity20 headed over the top			1
@entity57 - 7 @entity58 is a tricky customer but he stood up to him with varying success			2
does n’t look like someone who has played in a @entity63 final , though			0
@entity64 - 8 @entity65 , yet again			1
is n’t handed the plaudits the flair players are for obvious reasons , but there is n’t a better midfielder ahead of a back four in the @entity6			0
@entity64 was immense again in the @entity7 midfield @entity72 - 7.5 knits , threads and gives the @entity75 an impetus they lacked last season			1
consistent in his performances and seems to register an assist every week			0
@entity81 - 7.5 becoming a devilish to play against			0
happy to flit inside off his wing to influence the game but is equally adept at beating a man at the byline as he managed to great effect			2
@entity2 - 8.5 absolutely marvellous finish for the first goal , curling an effort with the outside of his foot beyond @entity94 from 18 yards			1
@entity95 and consistent @entity72 ( left ) skips away from @entity9 's @entity96 ( right ) @entity4 - 7.5 has n’t come under fire for his form this season as such , but hazard is yet to hit the heights of last year			1
good here , jinking and weaving on the edge of the box			0
won and then scored the penalty			1
@entity12 - 7 his mere presence is enough to strike fear among visiting defenders			2
hold - up play was its usual bustling brilliant			0
subs @entity112 ( for @entity81 , 64mins ) : back to his normal self , haring around @entity114			0
6 @entity115 ( for @entity12 , 78mins ) : had one stinging effort well saved by @entity94			0
6.5 @entity117 ( for @entity4 , 90mins ) : timewasting substitution			1
@entity9 @entity94 - 7 made a number of smart saves			1
no fumbles and kicked well			0
has had to up his game with the emergence of @entity125			0
@entity96 - 6.5 faced his toughest direct test since joining the club in @entity4 and - although the @entity128 was dumbfound on occasion - stuck to his guns			1
@entity130 - 6 the clamour for an @entity133 call - up seems like a lifetime ago now			0
may be good enough to keep the @entity9 in the division but up against @entity12 ? not quite there			1
@entity136 - 6.5 surprisingly , @entity137 did n’t have his back four stationed deep			0
that was potentially a recipe for disaster for @entity141 , but the captain performed admirably			0
@entity9 captain @entity136 ( left ) performed admirably up against @entity12 ( right ) returning from injury @entity144 - 5 given a torrid time at left back ; @entity81 ran him ragged and he looked out of his depth			1
began to get forward more after half - time			0
@entity58 - 7 could be the man to keep @entity9 in this division			1
has that driving ability with the ball you need to worry defenders			0
just a shame that he was stuck out on the right here and it ’s not in his nature to help defensively			0
slightly unfortunate in conceding the penalty			2
@entity58 was unfortunate to concede the penalty for the winner and was stuck out on the right @entity162 - 7 @entity7 did have a lot of the ball , but @entity162 kept his discipline well throughout			1
always showing for the ball			0
@entity167 - 6 fairly anonymous but for a deflected second half effor , which is no bad thing for a man sitting			2
failed to utilise his range of passing effectively - all the more galling given the speed of @entity173 ’ wide men			0
@entity175 - 7 big strong runs from the middle of the park as he tried to offer support to @entity20			1
@entity40 - 5.5 barely got a kick up against @entity37 and tends to hide when things are n’t going his way			0
@entity20 - 7.5 thankless task up there on his own			1
tried his best to ruffle the feathers of @entity53 and @entity44 and linked up nicely in spells			2
excellently - improvised flicked finish for the equaliser			0
@entity20 jumps in celebration after scoring the equaliser for @entity9 in the 62nd minute subs @entity192 ( for @entity40 , 60mins ) : wins almost every header and offers @entity137 an out - ball , particularly when they ’re chasing games			1
6.5 @entity197 ( for @entity198 , 84mins ) : tried to give @entity173 extra width in search of a late equaliser			0
6 like @entity203 's facebook page .			0

@entity2 was the star man for @entity7 with a stunning strike for the opener
@entity64 was peerless in doing the hard yards for the hosts
@entity20 ruffled feathers up front for @entity9 and scored cleverly
@entity7 won three points thanks to a penalty from @entity4
