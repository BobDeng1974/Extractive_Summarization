the wintry monday night at @entity1 is a cliche , but it was a crucial test in @entity4 ’s title crusade			1
with @entity7 level on points , any slip - up would have put @entity10 ’s men on the back foot throughout the festive period			2
step up , yet again , @entity12			0
the @entity14 captain scored his 60th goal – and 44th header – for the club inside the first two minutes at the @entity18 to set the tone for the game			1
the 2 - 0 win was reminiscent of a turning point in @entity4 ’s first title - winning season under @entity10 , a 1 - 0 triumph at @entity26 in 2005			1
at the heart of defence for both wins , near - on 10 years apart , was @entity12			2
his manager believes he is now as good as he ever was			0
after the match , @entity10 said : ‘ when he is on the pitch he is always a threat			0
but more important for me than the goal is the way he is playing this season , again			0
@entity12 has been at the heart of the @entity4 defence for well over a decade @entity12 brings his team - mates together to celebrate a 2 - 1 win against @entity53 in november the 34 - year - old thanks fans after making his 500th appearance as @entity4 captain in october ‘ when i came here ( in the summer of 2013 ) he was a bit in trouble , his career was a bit up and down and he was not playing regularly for @entity4			1
‘ but he has played basically every game , and , for me , at the same level as from 2004 - 2007 when i was here			0
’ @entity12 has changed vastly as a player since then - in fact , it could be said he is even better			2
next to @entity68 or @entity69 , he was the last - ditch man , throwing his body in the way of shots and attackers alike			0
with @entity74 now fulfilling that role , @entity12 is the calmer , far more composed of @entity4 ’s centre - half pairing			1
his impeccable reading of the game means he now steps up and intercepts through - balls , rather than flinging himself at the final shot			0
@entity12 was part of the @entity4 team that won a crucial away game against @entity26 in 2005 @entity14 legend @entity12 has been a key ingredient to @entity4 's most successful period as a club the @entity14 skipper has won three @entity37 titles with the @entity90 club @entity12 , seen here celebrating @entity4 's @entity91 win in 2012 , has won 12 major honours during his time in blue the common perception of his playing style is blood - and - guts , physical steel			1
rarely does he get praise for his exceptional technical ability , which is at the heart of his renaissance			0
wonderfully two - footed , his ability to send a 50 - yard glided ball to start an attack is topped only by metronome - like short passing to the likes of @entity109			0
with his body on the wane , @entity12 has used ingenuity in adapting his game to re-establish himself as one of @entity4 's most crucial players			1
once crashing into tackles as befitting his all - action style , the @entity4 captain has picked up just one booking this campaign – in the @entity121 against @entity122			2
@entity12 struggled for a first - team place while former @entity53 boss @entity124 ( right ) was in charge @entity12 , known for his bravery , receives a boot to the face from @entity130 midfielder @entity129 during @entity4 's @entity132 final win against @entity130 in 2007 critics will justifiably point to various off - pitch misdemeanours , although personally calling up a young fan this season in the wake of @entity10 ’s barbs at the @entity90 crowd only enhanced his deification among the @entity4 faithful			1
it ’s a relationship that has been built up over years – from his debut in 1998 , through trials and tribulations both on and off the pitch to becoming the embodiment of the crowd on the field			0
still the last player to come through @entity4 's academy and establish himself as a first - team regular , he is a link to the @entity4 of old , the thought behind the attacking delights of @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158			2
the @entity14 stalwart forged a strong bond with @entity10 during the manager 's first spell in charge @entity12 has seen fellow club legends @entity165 ( centre ) and @entity167 ( left ) leave the club last summer @entity12 has always responded to his critics in the best possible way			1
the same weekend the tabloids were plastered with tales of his alleged infidelity , he scored a crucial winner at @entity175			0
consigned to the bench by fleeting @entity4 managers in @entity178 and @entity124 , not many could see him as the defence ’s main man two years later			0
it was him , rather than @entity165 , deemed likely to be the first stalwart out of the exit door			0
@entity12 , pictured scoring against @entity186 last season , has now scored 44 headed goals for @entity4 from his debut in 1998 , through trials and tribulations both on and off the pitch , @entity12 has become the embodiment of the @entity4 fans on the pitch but the way @entity12 reacted to his old mentor @entity10 ’s return has perhaps been his most remarkable feat. a near ever - present since the start of last season , he has laughed in the face of suggestions he was finished at the top level			1
the 2005 - vintage @entity12 is worthy of a place in any debate over the best centre half in @entity37 history , sitting comfortably alongside the likes of @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211			1
the 2014 re-boot , @entity12 reinventing his game to lead another @entity4 title charge a decade down the line , surely puts him without peer			2
@entity12 seems to thrive off silencing his critics , as the @entity4 skipper looks to lead his side to success			1

@entity12 scored his 60th goal for @entity4 as they beat @entity1 on monday
@entity12 has been in *superb* form since the return of @entity10
the 34 - year - old has helped steer his side to three @entity37 titles
