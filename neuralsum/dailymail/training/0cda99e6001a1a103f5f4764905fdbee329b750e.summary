by @entity0 published : 18:23 est , 17 april 2013 updated : 01:55 est , 18 april 2013 a puppy needed a three hour operation after swallowing a sewing needle which became lodged in her spinal cord			2
eight month old golden @entity6 survived the operation unscathed and without any permanent damage despite the 1.5 inch needle piercing soft tissue and becoming lodged in the joint of her spine and skull			1
the needle was only discovered after @entity15 collapsed screaming in pain while out on a walk and x-rays and exploratory surgery on her stomach failed to get to the root of the puppy 's agony			1
lucky : @entity25 , with @entity26 who survived swallowing a needle and it becoming lodged in her spine painful : an x-ray image shows a 1.5 inch needle lodged in @entity6 's spinal cord owner @entity25 , 45 , said : ' @entity6 had broken through the stair gate and demolished the bedroom - she played with a couple of plastic hairbrushes and had bitten them			1
' then three days later when i took her for a walk she dropped to the floor and screamed in pain			0
' i thought she had swallowed something and had something in her stomach so i took her to the vets			2
' she had an x-ray of her stomach but it did n't show anything so they decided to open her up and have a look at it anyway			2
he added : ' but they still did n't find anything and her agony remained a mystery			0
' it was really stressful as she was still having fits of pain and we thought we were going to have to put her down			0
' the next day i took her back to the vets and they x-rayed her head and neck and that 's when they found the needle lodged			1
' mystery : the needle was only discovered after @entity15 collapsed screaming in pain while out on a walk and x-rays and exploratory surgery on her stomach failed to get to the root of the puppy 's agony agony : a scan picture shows the needle lodged in @entity6 's spinal cord			1
she needed a three - hour operation to have it removed @entity25 , who did not have pet insurance and had to fork out £ 4,500 pounds on vet bills for @entity6 , took the dog 90 miles north to the @entity87 , @entity88 , to remove the needle			1
@entity90 , one of the vets who operated on @entity6 , said : ' you do n't expect to see a dog with a needle in their spinal cord so we were very shocked , it was quite extraordinary			0
' we had to be extremely careful not to move the spinal cord when we removed the needle , as like in humans it is connected to all the nerve endings and could leave permanent damage			0
costly : @entity6 's owner @entity25 had to shell out £ 4,500 on vets fees as he had no pet insurance ' afterwards i had expected to see some swelling which might have made @entity6 weak or have neurological problems			1
' i told the owner not to expect her to walk the next day but she was up walking around with no problems and was back to her normal self			0
' we were really pleased			0
' @entity25 said @entity6 is now fully recovered and has been playing with his other @entity115 , @entity116 , ten .			0

@entity26 swallowed the 1.5 inch needle while exploring
she collapsed in agony while out walking with owner @entity25
x-rays and *examinations* of her stomach found no problem
but a chance x-ray showed a needle lodged in her spine
owner was n't insured and paid out £ 4,500 for the operation
