this is the dramatic moment two traffic police officers were almost decapitated after a caravan sped past at speed with a window wide open			1
the motorway officers had been standing on the hard shoulder on the @entity7 in @entity8 at night after pulling over a driver , who they suspected was speeding			1
they then spotted a caravan heading towards them in the dark and at the last minute spotted the nearside back window was open			1
the caravan , which sped past the two traffic police officers with its back window open , circled , and almost decapitated them the two officers spotted that the caravan 's window was open with just seconds to spare and managed to dive out of the way the pair were forced to dive out of the way with just seconds to spare before they were severely injured			1
the caravan also narrowly missed a workman standing further along the carriageway and the two officers got into their patrol car to give chase			2
they then quickly caught up with the driver towing the caravan and stopped him between junctions 11 and 11a near @entity32			0
he told the officers that he was unaware that the window had become loose and opened and was made to close it securely			2
the near - miss came to light after @entity39 's @entity38 tweeted about sunday night 's incident			0
they posted : ' if you look very closely , top left above the road sign you will just make out the caravan nearside window open , which we did n’t notice until we stopped the car that was in lane 2 for speeding			1
' we were seconds away from being beheaded on @entity7			2
the near - miss came to light after @entity39 's @entity38 tweeted about sunday night 's incident ' it was the car drivers lucky night as we had to go after and stop the caravan			0
