by @entity0 it 's clear to see who is the leader of this wolf pack in @entity4			2
@entity5 , 79 , sits at the top of the table in this pack of 29 wolves			1
for 40 years the ex-paratrooper has hand reared and lived among wolves at his sanctuary in @entity14 , @entity4			1
the enclosure at @entity24 , in @entity14 , in the @entity4 province of @entity26 , contains wolves from six different packs across the world			2
they include @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity50 regions			0
some of which look fairly similar , but the snowy white @entity20 wolves are the most distinguishable from the rest			0
@entity5 exerts his dominance at feeding time , ensuring he is the first to get his teeth into some raw meat knowing their place in the pack , the hungry wolves can do little more than watch on , while salivating , as @entity5 tucks into a deer 's leg once @entity5 has had his fill , the lower ranking wolves can finally move in and begin to devour the carcass the hungry @entity50 wolves finally get their fill and devour the entire deer cadaver at feeding time , @entity5 must ensure he continues to feed first and disallows any of the hungry and salivating wolves to come near , in order to maintain the respect of the pack			1
it is for this reason that they do not attack him and , instead , lick his face and act playfully when they are not feeding			0
when they are not feeding , the pack show their affection for their leader , staying close and acting playful @entity50 wolf @entity83 licks the mouth of wolf researcher @entity5 in a sign of acknowledgement and subservience unperturbed : @entity5 is used to this sort of behaviour , which far from being aggressive , is in fact a sign of respect and submission from the wolf @entity5 , 79 , a former @entity4 paratrooper , established the wolf sanctuary in 1972 and has raised more than 70 animals over the last 40 years @entity5 established the wolf sanctuary , which is spread over 25 acres , in 1972 and has raised more than 70 animals over the last 40 years			1
the wolves , acquired as cubs from zoos or animal parks , were mostly hand - reared			0
at home in the @entity20 conditions : spread over 25 acres , @entity24 is currently home to 29 wolves forming six packs from @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity50 regions home from home : the @entity20 wolves look quite at home in their currently snow - covered enclosure one of them : leaning back on his haunches and howling into the cold air , @entity5 looks completely at one with his life as leader of the wolf pack @entity5 has a ready supply of slaughtered deer to feed his pack , all of which he will have to eat himself to show who is boss			0

@entity5 , 79 , has raised more than 70 wolves on his sanctuary in @entity14 , @entity4
