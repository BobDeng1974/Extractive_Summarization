by @entity0 published : 14:15 est , 25 march 2013 updated : 05:58 est , 26 march 2013 a terminally ill mother 's dying wish was fulfilled after she celebrated her son 's first birthday with a traditional party with cake , balloons and a bouncy castle			1
@entity9 has a rare form of cancer which causes tumors all over her body and was told she would be made infertile by her radiation treatment			1
despite the odds , she gave birth to ' miracle ' baby @entity18 last year			2
but mrs @entity9 was told she would not live to see @entity18 turn two , so she wanted to make his first birthday special			1
terminally ill cancer sufferer @entity9 wanted to make the first birthday of her son @entity18 special because it is likely to be the last she spends with him many happy returns : the special birthday party had everything a child could wish for including clowns and balloons after mrs @entity9 , who lives in @entity32 , struggled with mounting medical bills , it seemed unlikely that the party for @entity18 , who has @entity35 , would go ahead			1
mrs @entity9 ' wish was granted however , when an @entity38 charity stepped in and threw @entity18 a carnival to celebrate his first year			1
the party included clowns , balloons , a bouncy castle and a colorful birthday cake			1
mrs @entity9 said : ‘ it 's so much more than i could have hoped for			0
it 's amazing , ’ she told @entity47 : ‘ it 's very special because not only are we celebrating my son 's first year and everything that he had to go through to get here , but it 's the one birthday that i 'll get with him			0
and we get to celebrate the one year that we had together			0
’ amid preparations for the party , mrs @entity9 decided to stop all treatments and come home to live her remaining days			2
she said : ' my cancer has unfortunately progressed to a point where there 's really nothing else that we can do			0
we 've pretty much run the gamut and tried everything			0
a colorful iced cake was made especially for the occasion - which @entity18 seemed to thoroughly enjoy judging by the smile on his face it was the first and last birthday that @entity32 mom @entity9 would likely spend with her son , @entity18 ' so we 're just going to live out the rest of the days as best we can and be as happy as we can with the time we have left			1
although @entity18 will be too young to remember the party , mrs @entity9 wanted him to have photos and videos of the day as keepsakes after she passes away			2
loved ones gather to celebrate @entity18 's first birthday for what is likely the only birthday his mother will get to celebrate with him she added : ‘ i want him to be able to look back on videos and pictures from today and hear the stories about today , and for him to know how much his mom loved him			0
and for him to know how hard his mom fought to be here for him			0
’ the charity which organized the party , 3 @entity88 , has also fixed a young man ’s ‘ chemo teeth ’ and helped a person with brain cancer go to @entity91 .			0

@entity9 told she would be infertile , before giving birth to @entity18
rare cancer means she will not live to see his second birthday
she threw a traditional party with cake , balloons , clowns and bouncy castle
