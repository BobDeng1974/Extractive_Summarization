just a 20 minute drive along the coast from the centre of @entity3 lies the @entity4 - a five - star resort with all the class and style of the popular holiday city but , thankfully , without the gaudy reality tv stars swanning around like they own the place			1
whether i was just fortunate enough to avoid the cast of @entity13 during my visit to @entity4 or whether they always opt for a more convenient location for the nightlife i ca n't be certain , but i suspect it 's the latter			0
this particular property - one of more than 80 owned by @entity19 throughout @entity20 , @entity21 , the @entity22 and @entity23 - does n't need to be right in the thick of things			0
in fact , that 's the beauty of it			0
the outside of the @entity29 , which is situated near @entity30 and @entity3 on the @entity31 an aerial view of the hotel and its spacious grounds which lead down towards an area of beach visitors can cool off in one of three outdoor pools , while there is also an indoor pool for the winter months @entity42 , the scheduled leisure airline , operates flights to @entity44 from @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity50 airports with fares , including taxes , starting from Â£ 32.99 one way for further information or to book @entity42 flights , @entity56 or @entity57 , please visit @entity58 during my stay i felt no desire to wander outside of the hotel grounds , which handily include their own section of beach			1
my feet could be on the sand within two minutes of closing my room door			0
not bad , eh ? the hotel is designed to provide guests with everything they need for the entirety of their stay - a choice of restaurants and bars , three outdoor pools and an indoor one , spa treatments and a sauna , a gym , tennis courts and water sports on the aforementioned beach			1
the only time i ventured away from the 147 - room complex was to play two of the @entity31 's most popular golf courses - @entity87 and @entity88 - which are just a couple of around 50 in the surrounding area			1
but more about that later			0
numerous palm trees are reflected in one of the hotel 's pools as the sun sets in southern @entity96 the hotel 's @entity98 restaurant specialises in fresh seafood served the @entity102 way one of the hotel 's two bars ( left ) provides guests enjoying the sun with refreshments throughout the day if you do fancy exploring southern @entity96 then the beautiful village of @entity30 is less than two miles away			2
day trips to @entity44 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 are also an attractive option for those wanting to use the hotel as a base , rather than just a retreat			0
from the moment you walk through the large revolving doors and into the vast reception area it 's clear that @entity19 pride themselves on quality			0
from the decoration of the hotel to the softness of the robe hanging on the back of each bathroom door , the service offered by each smiling member of staff to the taste of the fresh fish served in the beachside seafood restaurant			2
no wonder the vast majority of guest reviews found elsewhere online are overwhelmingly positive			0
i witnessed people of all ages enjoying the luxurious surroundings during my trip in mid-september - families with toddlers in tow , couples both young and old and groups of friends , some of which were using the hotel as their hq to test out the plentiful fairways and greens of southern @entity96			2
our man @entity158 poses outside the @entity29 after spending two days at the resort the hotel backs directly onto an area of sandy beach which guests can enjoy peacefully the sun beams down on the @entity19 hotel - one of more than 80 owned by the company worldwide the hotel is 75km from @entity44 airport , or more importantly about an hour 's drive			1
its location adds something extra to the plush grounds and top - of - the - range facilities - beautiful views of the @entity177 and , if it 's clear enough , the northern coast of @entity23			0
the hotel 's @entity182 - @entity181 design distinguishes it from other coastal hotels in the area , while its lush subtropical gardens cover an extensive area of 45,000 square metres			2
with 132 spacious rooms and 15 luxury suites , all of which enjoy either a terrace or balcony with views of the garden and the sea , the hotel never seems too busy even when at full capacity			1
during my two - night stay i was able to sample food from two of the hotel 's restaurants and drinks at both of its bars , including their signature the golfer cocktail - a refreshing mix of vodka , melon and lemon sorbet			2
there are plenty of sun loungers and beds surrounding the pools for guests to put their feet up and relax the hotel has views of @entity222 and the northern coast of @entity23 when the sky is clear enough a typical sea view from one of the 132 standard rooms at the five - star @entity19 hotel the culinary highlight was a delicious sea bass fillet , which followed a delightful mini curried chicken burger , scallops and three different varieties of tomato with the region 's famous @entity237 - chestnut - fed ham to you and me			1
that tremendous meal arrived after a day spent at @entity242 , one of the most visually - stunning and challenging golf courses on the @entity31 although my performance left much to be desired , the course was on par with the popular @entity87 i 'd played the day before			1
both showed off the local landscape , with lush fairways , devilish rough and water features aplenty providing a difficult test for golfers of all abilities			0
while i left realising lessons are a must in 2015 , both courses provided me with the most enjoyable golfing experience of my life			0
@entity87 is one of the @entity31 's most well known and popular golf courses the first hole at @entity263 is a tricky par four with a hilly fairway and bunkers surrounding the green a large lake on hole three is sure to have golfers aiming right to avoid going into the water every now and then i 'd hit a @entity273 - style shot and admire it landing on the perfectly manicured putting surface or flying straight down the greener - than - green fairway			1
it sure beat a rainy afternoon at my local pay - and - play			0
@entity88 and @entity87 are just two of more than 20 courses to offer special packages and prices for guests of @entity29 , adding another incentive for those wanting to test out their skills in @entity96			1
but whether it 's golf or simply a relaxing break you 're after , @entity29 has the facilities , staff and quality of service to ensure you return home and immediately want to go back			1
@entity88 is another popular track in the @entity31 and it 's only 20 minutes from @entity4 the 18 - hole course will provide even the most talented of amateur golfers with a stern test @entity88 's stunning clubhouse welcomes those golfers completing the 18th hole			2

the @entity29 is just a 20 - minute drive from @entity3
the luxurious beachside hotel has 132 rooms and 15 luxury suites
facilities include four *swimming* pools , a gym , tennis courts and a spa
