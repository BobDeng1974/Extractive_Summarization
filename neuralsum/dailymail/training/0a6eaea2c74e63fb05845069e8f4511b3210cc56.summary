by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 failed to persuade @entity3 to underwrite the £ 4million share issue the club launched yesterday as they desperately attempt to combat their mounting financial crisis			1
the @entity8 board released a statement to the @entity10 which revealed an uptake from existing shareholders of at least £ 3m would be required for the issue to go ahead			1
it carried a stark warning that failure to reach that amount would mean @entity2 being ‘ unable to pay its creditors as they fall due and the future of the @entity20 will be uncertain ’			2
in that event , directors will ‘ immediately have to seek emergency financing which may or may not be available ’			0
no go : @entity25 - based businessman @entity3 , pictured here at @entity8 , wo n't underwrite the shares issue @entity8 sources have discounted the prospect of a second administration as a consequence , but football finance expert @entity31 , of @entity32 , told @entity33 that can not be ruled out			1
succeeding with the share issue would provide breathing space and @entity33 understands an approach was made to @entity3 ahead of the launch			1
the @entity25 - based businessman has previously stated a willingness to invest £ 30m into the club but is seeking significant boardroom influence in return			1
while he is not an existing shareholder eligible to buy into the new issue , @entity3 would have been able to play an underwriting role to plug any shortfall			1
talks broke down , however , with the @entity49 - born businessman seemingly unhappy at the terms and a lack on information			2
back on the brink : if the shares issues fails to reach at least £ 3m then @entity2 ' future could be uncertain again ‘ we have spoken with mr @entity3 but the content of our discussion shall remain private , ’ a @entity2 spokesman told @entity33 yesterday while @entity3 himself was unavailable for comment			1
one @entity62 source did , however , confirm the nature of the talks and detailed why @entity3 had rejected the offer			2
‘ there was an approach to @entity3 but he pointed out the money was n’t enough to cover the club ’s short - term needs , ’ said the source			1
‘ there was also dubiety about whether it would provide shares			0
it could still have proceeded but he wanted @entity2 to provide access to the books , which was refused			1
’ the issue has now been launched without an underwriter but @entity82 owner @entity81 could yet play a significant role			2
he remains keen to expand his stake while remaining beneath levels that govern dual ownership			0
off - field distractions : @entity2 manager @entity88 ( left ) attempts to focus on the playing side of the club the need for income at @entity2 has been increased by a drop in season - ticket sales from 36,000 to 23,000 and the requirement to repay £ 1.5m in loans received from shareholders @entity97 and @entity99			1
they were due their money by close of business yesterday but that deadline has been extended until the end of the share - issue process on september 18			2
failure to repay would see @entity97 and @entity107 gain security over the @entity110 car park and @entity112 facilities at @entity8			0
the @entity10 statement revealed @entity2 had just £ 1.54m of accessible cash at the end of june and made it clear the share issue was only a stop - gap measure			1
@entity118 needed : @entity2 will hope the @entity120 giants can gain promotion from the @entity122 it said : ‘ assuming full subscription , the @entity20 will require additional external funding in the latter half of the current financial year in order to meet working capital requirements as a result of the cyclical nature of its business			2
at the minimum level of subscription , additional working capital will be required towards the end of the current calendar year			0
’ it is thought the intention is to reach an agm in october or november and gain shareholder approval for a wider issue that would be cornerstone of the aim to bring in between ‘ £ 20m - £ 30m ’ over the next three years			1
@entity3 could enter the fray at that point but the immediate future is the most pressing concern			0
@entity31 , who has followed the @entity2 saga , believes the coming weeks will be vital			0
‘ i think this is probably the worst point since coming out of administration two years ago , ’ he said			0
‘ there is obviously a clear , short - term cash shortfall			0
and therefore you ca n’t rule out a chain of events that leads to there not being enough funding there			0
‘ i do n’t think that we are looking at administration just yet , but it is quite a stark financial situation they are in right now			0
there is a crucial period coming up			0
it is a very important two to three months			0

financially troubled @entity164 giants have attempted to raise around £ 4million with new shares being made available to existing shareholders
however @entity3 has refused to underwrite any shortfall in the issue
the @entity25 - based businessman has stated a willingness to invest £ 30m into @entity2 but wants significant boardroom influence in return
