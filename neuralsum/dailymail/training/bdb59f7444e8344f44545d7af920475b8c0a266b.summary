by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent hundreds of thousands of @entity4 immigrants came into @entity5 uncounted because inspectors were at the wrong airports , officials admitted yesterday			1
a damning report reveals that 350,000 people arrived unnoticed because of glaring gaps in the survey relied on by the @entity12 for migration estimates			2
those counting migrants into the country went to @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 during the crucial years of large - scale immigration from @entity4 , while only a handful attended other major airports such as @entity22 and @entity23 , where hundreds of thousands of migrants were arriving			1
new figures reveal how from 2001 to 2011 , in many years net migration had been underestimated in addition , immigrants on many ferry routes were barely or never checked , tens of thousands of children were missed entirely and warning signs from other statistics were ignored , the report adds			0
the @entity12 confession comes almost 12 months after the discrepancies first emerged – and follows years of scepticism over the accuracy of its @entity38 , which is based on interviews with people passing through air and sea ports			0
last may the @entity43 revealed that the 2011 census found nearly half a million more people in the country than the @entity12 had estimated and that the great majority were @entity4 immigrants			1
yesterday ’s report appealed for the millions of pounds spent on the immigration survey to be quadrupled to cope with the rate of arrivals			1
other @entity12 surveys of the population in @entity5 suggested immigration was much higher than the @entity38 estimates			1
the rate at which @entity58 numbers were issued to new workers also indicated that immigration figures must be wrong			1
but between 2005 and 2008 nothing was done to put the survey right			0
the 2011 national census found there were 464,000 more people in the country than had been expected			0
the @entity12 said yesterday that most of the unchecked immigrants arrived in the four years after @entity68 and seven other @entity4 countries entered the @entity70 in april 2004 , when @entity5 was one of just three @entity4 countries to allow them in to take jobs			1
failures in the survey meant that between 2001 and 2011 , net migration – the population change after both immigration and emigration are counted – was underestimated by 346,000 , equivalent to a city the size of @entity82			1
nearly a quarter of a million went uncounted between 2005 and 2008 alone , when there were just a handful of clipboard survey staff at @entity22 and @entity23 and none at all at @entity89 airport near @entity90			0
the @entity12 said researchers focussed on large airports including @entity16 and @entity17 , but overlooked the number of immigrants arriving through smaller regional airports these errors add to a decade of mismanagement of migration estimates and surveys			1
before the labour market was opened to @entity4 , @entity101 ’s government published projections which said the likely future level of eastern @entity4 immigration would be 13,000 people a year			1
‘ the migrants were missed due to @entity38 interviewing being concentrated at the time at principal airports , such as @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , ’ the report said			1
‘ during this time , many migrants from the @entity112 countries were travelling on the increasing number of routes connecting their countries with the @entity5 regional airports			1
‘ the number of routes connecting @entity5 airports with airports in @entity112 countries increased from 30 in 2001 to a peak of 190 in 2007			2
many of these routes were not covered , or not fully covered , by the @entity38 for migration purposes prior to 2009			0
’ the report said the @entity38 has since been upgraded to cover regional airports			1
but it admitted the survey between 2004 and 2008 was ‘ inadequate ’ and improvements ‘ came too late to capture much of the increased migration following 2004 ’			0
@entity133 , who has been branded ' brass necked beyond belief ' @entity133 was branded ‘ brass - necked beyond belief ’ last night after complaining about the number of migrants in @entity5			0
the shadow home secretary said she was ‘ concerned ’ about the level of ‘ cheap migrant labour ’ from @entity4 countries			1
miss @entity133 , who was a minister for more than a decade in the last @entity143 government , also claimed she did not want @entity5 to be ‘ dependent ’ on migrant workers			0
the speech appeared to suggest @entity143 is taking a more sceptical approach on immigration , which is consistently among voters ’ top concerns			2
but @entity151 @entity150 demanded she apologise for @entity143 ’s mistakes			0
@entity153 , of the @entity154 , said : ‘ it was her government that has prime responsibility for the number of @entity4 migrants in @entity5 because they failed to impose transitional controls … this is brass - necked beyond belief			1
’ @entity163 ’s sir @entity162 said miss @entity133 ’s speech hid ‘ the absence of any real policy ’ on cutting migrant numbers			0
inspectors now interview up to 800,000 of the 200million thought to be entering or leaving the country every year			2
improving accuracy by a useful margin would mean interviewing four times more passengers , raising the annual cost of the survey from £ 5million to £ 20million , the @entity12 said			0
sir @entity162 of campaign group @entity163 said : ‘ this is final confirmation that net foreign migration under @entity143 totals nearly four million , two - thirds from outside the @entity70			0
‘ it also shows that the peak of net migration was nearly 275,000 a year , making it even more difficult for the present government to get the numbers down to tens of thousands			2
’ @entity183 pledged to reduce net migration to 1990s levels of below 100,000 by the 2015 election			0
‘ latest figures put net migration at 212,000 for the year up to last september			2
the figure is going up thanks to @entity70 migration which the government is not allowed to restrain , ’ sir @entity162 added			0
the prime minister ’s spokesman said yesterday : ‘ what the latest @entity12 statistics underline is the point at which , in the 2000s , immigration was out of control			2
’ he added that despite the error mr @entity183 had confidence in the @entity12 .			0

year after year official data played down scale of immigration
researchers went to @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 airports
but *influx* from eastern @entity4 came through smaller , regional airports
