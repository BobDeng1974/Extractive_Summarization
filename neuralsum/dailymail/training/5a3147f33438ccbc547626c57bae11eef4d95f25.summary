by @entity0 he 's spent his career playing despicable characters - a rapist in doctors , a homophobe in @entity6 , an abusive boyfriend in @entity8 , and now @entity9 , @entity10 's womanising crook			1
but @entity11 could n't be happier			1
' i think it 's better to play baddies , ' says the 27 - year - old @entity16 - born actor			1
' they 're always in the thick of the action and you get all these wicked things to say and do			2
' as @entity10 's resident bad boy @entity9 , he 's had his fair share			1
@entity9 arrived in the village a year ago , attacking @entity24 and stealing her car			2
since then he 's been shot in a drug - gang dispute , bungled a robbery with corrupt cop @entity28 , and is now falling for her			1
@entity11 insists that , in real life , he does n't live up to his bad boy character ' @entity9 is great to play – he 's someone you love to hate , ' says @entity11			1
' and even though he does horrible things , now and then he has a lighter side			2
' the lines they give me are absolute gold dust			0
i do n't know what it is about me that gets me chosen for these roles			1
i think i have a menacing stare that puts the wind up people – that 's all i can put it down to			0
' @entity47 or @entity48 ? i go to @entity47 all the time because my mum 's family come from @entity51 or pizza ? pizza			0
i had one last night , and the night before , and the night before that - seriously ! beer or spirits ? @entity57 in the summer , but lager the rest of the time			1
pub or club ? at 27 i already feel i 'm older than everyone else in clubs , so i 'm becoming a pub @entity64 or @entity65 ? my first album was nevermind by @entity65			0
i like walking with aggressive music , like rock and hip - hop , in my @entity71 clothes or high street ? i prefer plain clothes to @entity74 or boxing ? i did @entity77 boxing for years and love watching pretty much any kind of martial art. in real life , @entity11 could n't be more different from his on - screen character			1
after graduating from drama school aged 21 and while auditioning for acting roles , he worked as a teaching assistant in special needs schools in @entity86			1
' some days it could be the hardest job i 've ever done , but it was also incredibly rewarding , ' he recalls			0
' when you see the children are learning , and you 're growing very fond of them , no other job can compare			2
i think i was a positive role model , ' @entity11 says proudly			1
' i 'm still in contact with some of them and write job references for them			0
' but they made more of an impression on me ! the main thing i took from it is to never feel sorry for myself again			0
lots of them had problems at home , so coming to school was a major issue , but they were still excited to be there			0
it gave me another outlook on life			2
' but @entity11 's main goal was always acting and after landing minor roles in other tv soaps and dramas he beat off dozens of rivals for the part of @entity9			1
it came just in time for his biggest fan to see him perform in a major soap			0
' my grandma sadly passed away at @entity118 , but it meant she got to see me on screen and she had the ultimate bragging rights at church , ' he smiles			0
@entity11 's acting success is even more remarkable given that he 's dyslexic			1
' i 've always got by , ' he says			0
' @entity124 scripts is fine			0
but if you asked me to do a presenting job , reading an autocue , i just would n't have a hope			2
' he says his hectic schedule leaves little time for romance			0
' i 've had girlfriends , but nothing too serious as at the moment i 'm so busy at work ! but never say never ... '			0
