by @entity1 reporter @entity4 's former pilot is allowed to make a case that he has no confidentiality agreement covering his employment with the actor , an appeals court ruled			1
@entity9 , who wants to give a revealing account of his time working for @entity4 's airline company @entity12 , was given approval by a @entity15 court on tuesday to make his case			1
@entity9 , who claims to have had more than just a business relationship with the star , has been trying to prove the agreement is invalid , after @entity4 's attorney made a cease - and - desist order			1
according to @entity34 , @entity9 decided to ' tell the story of his life ' including his dealings with @entity4 , after being ' unwillingly thrust ' into the spotlight by revelations from another former employee of the star			2
he spoke to the @entity33 and also planned to write a book about his experiences with @entity4 , who also has a pilot 's license			1
warning @entity9 ' you proceed at your peril , ' @entity30 wrote : ' we demand that you immediately cease and desist from your wrongful course of conduct which has subjected you to enormous liability and entitles my client to seek tens of millions of dollars in compensatory and punitive damages , ' the @entity46 reported			0
@entity9 had worked for @entity4 's @entity58 airlines for six years at the start of the 1980s , and when he left the company he had a written termination notice with @entity12			2
however , the former employee and the company are now disputing which termination agreement is valid , with @entity66 claiming that the final one , dated march 17 , 1987 , did not contain a confidentiality clause			0
tell all : @entity9 is trying to prove he is free to discuss the six years he spent working with @entity4 in the 80s boss : @entity4 , pictured in 1983 , hired @entity9 for his airline company @entity12 @entity72 , however , has said that the correct version of the agreement was a longer version signed april 3 , 1987 , which included clauses preventing @entity9 from discussing his time with the company			2
the later agreement allegedly stated : ' you hereby represent that you have not and will not disclose , communicate , use , nor permit the use of , in any fashion , any personal ( i.e. , those matters not customarily disclosed by @entity85 other than to insiders , in the case of [ @entity88 ] , or close friends in the case of @entity4 ) , confidential or proprietary information about @entity85 or any principals of employer that you obtained during your employment with employer			0
' to try to prove his point , @entity9 sued @entity4 and @entity58 to get a judicial declaration about which agreement was valid and whether the confidentiality clause was valid			1

the actor is a qualified pilot who has flown @entity103 jets lawyers for @entity4 have tried to apply for legal motions to stop @entity9 @entity72 has twice tried , unsuccessful , to apply for an @entity107 motion to stop @entity9 's complaint			1
when the case was heard by the appeals court tuesday , presiding justice @entity109 said the case was not based on @entity30 's ' sabre - rattling [ but ] the validity of the asserted termination agreements '			0
he added : ' although the prelitigation letters may have triggered @entity9 's complaint and may be evidence in support of the complaint , they are not the basis of the complaint			2
' he ruled that to say otherwise ' would lead to the absurd result that a person receiving a demand letter threatening legal action for breach of contract would be precluded from seeking declaratory relief to determine the validity of the contract			0
' an attorney for @entity4 told the hollywood reporter : ' while we believe the court should have thrown out @entity9 â€™s lawsuit at the outset , ultimately , he will not prevail on his claim			0
' @entity9 points to an unsigned draft agreement , which he now claims is the controlling document in the case , yet he attached as an exhibit to his own complaint the final version of the contract that he signed barring his claim			1
we are very confident that in the end we will prevail in the action			0

@entity9 claims he is not bound by confidentiality agreement
