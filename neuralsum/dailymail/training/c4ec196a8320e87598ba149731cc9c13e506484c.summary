do n't tempt me ... britons are being told by the health watchdog @entity2 not to offer treats to friends and family who are trying to lose weight			1
( @entity9 picture ) britons are being told by the health watchdog not to offer sweet treats to friends and family who are trying to lose weight			1
they are also being instructed not to invite colleagues who are attempting to cut back on alcohol to go the pub after work			2
the watchdog , @entity2 , says it is neither ‘ helpful ’ nor ‘ a joke ’ to deliberately try to tempt those who are desperately trying to stick to resolutions to become healthier			1
guidelines issued by the organisation today also urge doctors , nurses and midwives to question patients about their lifestyles when they arrive in @entity29 , have a routine appointment or scan , or come in to pick up a prescription			1
staff should use ‘ every opportunity ’ to help patients change unhealthy habits			1
they are told not to be too ‘ embarrassed ’ to ask overweight patients sensitively whether they have thought about going on a diet , or would consider doing do so			1
and if they suspect someone has a drink problem , they are encouraged to ask them questions designed to assess their alcohol intake			2
the guidelines – published when millions have made @entity49 ’s resolutions to tackle their weight or drinking – are intended to help health staff and the general public tackle the rising problem of obesity and excessive drinking			1
employers are told to consider banning staff from smoking throughout the working day and to ensure they motivate staff who are trying to lead healthier lives			1
the advice also reminds local councils they have the power to ban pubs from opening in areas where there are already a high number of licensed premises			2
but critics have accused @entity2 of ‘ nannying ’ and say the last thing adults need is to be ‘ lectured ’ on healthy living by their own friends and family			1
@entity78 , of the @entity79 ’ @entity81 campaign group , said : ‘ this is subversive nannying from a health quango that puts out this kind of drivel in a desperate attempt to justify its continued and costly existence			1
‘ many of us will be trying to shed a few extra pounds or cut back on the booze over the new year , but we do n’t need quangocrats lecturing our friends and colleagues while we do so			0
this is further evidence that @entity2 is both a waste of everybody ’s time and taxpayers ’ money			2
’ with more than a quarter of @entity10 now obese , the guidelines urge medics not to be too ‘ embarrassed ’ to ask overweight patients sensitively whether they have thought about going on a diet , or would consider doing do so but professor @entity104 , director of the centre of public health at @entity2 , said : ‘ the idea is quite simple			1
first of all you should share your goals with friends , family and work colleagues so they understand what you ’re trying to do			0
‘ they also must understand it ’s not helpful or a joke to tempt people deliberately			1
some do – it ’s a bit of fun			0
they go on a diet , and someone says , “ oh come on this cream cake wo n’t do any harm ”			0
’ ‘ say for example someone says , “ i ’m going to make a real effort to cut down on my drinking			0
” if the first thing that happens within the next five minutes is that a colleague says , “ come on , we ’re all going down the pub after work ” , that does n’t help			0
‘ it ’s asking people to be a bit more thoughtful , a bit more understanding of the difficulties			0
when people fall off their best intentions , they ca n’t keep on the diet , that ’s where friends , family and so on can help			0
‘ it ’s a bit of encouragement and it ’s a way of sharing the task rather than people trying to do it on their own			0
it ’s based on very sound psychological principles which acknowledge that our ambitions often outstrip our human capacity to do things			0
‘ it ’s that nudge in the right direction that can keep people on track			0
’ just over a quarter of adults in @entity10 are now obese while nearly half of men and a third of women drink too much alcohol			2
@entity2 , the @entity2 , says @entity10 have done very well in recent years to cut down on smoking , but obesity and excessive drinking remain huge public health concerns			1
the watchdog is also in charge of deciding which new drugs should be available on the @entity176 and it has been criticised in the past for rejecting life - extending cancer drugs			0
last year not one of the 11 new drugs made available was approved			0
some of its other health guidance has been deemed controversial			2
last year it suggested councils should raise parking charges to encourage the public to walk .			0
