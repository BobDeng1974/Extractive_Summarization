by @entity1 reporter published : 08:08 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 19:56 est , 24 july 2013 @entity2 underwent drastic weight loss surgery five years ago after struggling to shed the weight shed piled on after having her children			1
after years of failed diets and with her weight sticking stubbornly at 20 stone , @entity2 decided to have a gastric band fitted			1
the mother of two was delighted as the pounds rolled off and her dress size dropped from a 24 to a 12			2
but her weight kept falling and falling , and then she collapsed at work			0
at hospital , doctors assumed the gastric band was too tight and decided to remove it , only to discover her stomach had become tangled in the band and turned gangrenous			2
to save her life , surgeons had to remove 90 per cent of her stomach			0
mrs @entity2 is now a healthy ten - and - a - half stone			1
but as a result of the surgery she never feels hungry – and has to set an alarm to remind her to eat six times a day			1
the operation left her with hardly any stomach lining , which produces the hormone that drives the hunger instinct			0
her remaining stomach is so small that the 47 - year - old can eat only tiny portions of food , using a baby ’s bowl for her meals			2
‘ i have n’t felt hungry for months , ’ she said yesterday			1
‘ i think it would take me days before i realised i have n’t eaten without the alarm reminder			0
before having a gastric band fitted , mrs @entity2 ( pictured in 2007 ) says she would devour biscuits , crisps , sandwiches and sausage rolls for lunch - and she would binge on sweets once a week ‘ when i was not working and recovering at home i found it easier to remember , but now i am back at work full time it is so easy to let it slip my mind			1
‘ the alarm is also important as it makes my colleagues aware that i need to have something to eat , otherwise meetings can go on for hours and i could be starving without knowing it			0
‘ when i had the band i still felt hungry , but it stopped me overeating			2
now i have to force myself to eat when i am not hungry			0
it is completely different psychologically			0
’ due to a freak complication surgeons had to remove the majority of mrs @entity2 's stomach , which means she never feels hungry			1
she now has to set an alarm on her phone to remind her to eat mrs @entity2 , of @entity69 , @entity70 , went up to 20 stone after having her daughters @entity72 , now 25 , and @entity74 , 21			1
the mother - of - two has dropped nine stone to weigh a healthy 11 stone 7lb at work she would eat biscuits , crisps , sandwiches and sausage rolls for lunch and then binge on sweets			1
she had the gastric band fitted in 2007 and slimmed to 11 - and - a - half stone by eating three small meals a day and exercising			1
however as the band failed her weight dropped further			0
at the end of january she collapsed and had her stomach removed			2
despite her ordeal , she urged others to consider having a gastric band fitted			2
‘ i have no regrets , ’ she said			0
‘ the band is the best thing i have ever done			0
i do n’t want people to be put off when what happened to me was a freak occurrence			0

@entity2 , 47 , had majority of stomach removed after her gastric band broke
she had dropped from 20 stone to 11 stone 7lb , from a size 24 to a size 12
mrs @entity2 says she has *n't* felt hungry for months and must now set an alarm on her *mobile* phone to remind her to eat six times a day
despite her ordeal she still believes her gastric band was the best thing she has ever done
those who are *mocked* for being *overweight* are more likely to get **fat*ter* , according to a study by @entity121 – because fear of *ridicule* means they avoid exercise and are prone to *comfort* eating .
meanwhile , *scientists* in @entity129 have developed a *breath* *sensor* that can *accurately* *measure* actual *fat* loss after exercise . *researcher* @entity133 said it could play ‘ a *pivotal* role ’ in the fight against *obesity* .
