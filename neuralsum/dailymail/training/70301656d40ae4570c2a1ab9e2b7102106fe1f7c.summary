by @entity0 published : 09:31 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 09:49 est , 26 september 2013 these bizarre and somewhat sinister images look like something out of a twisted fairytale			2
the macabre tableaux show stuffed animals in a variety of human situations , including a wedding attended solely by kittens and a primary school class where all the pupils are bunnies			1
but in the @entity14 - and right up to the 1970s - they were part of a thriving tourist attraction which drew in thousands			0
the purrfect wedding : in this display more than a dozen kittens are posed and dressed up like they are at a wedding i do : the kitten bride , groom and vicar were posed up to mimic a real - life wedding ceremony detail : the kitten guests are given very intridcate costumes , including earrings and a waistcoat chain from 1861 until 1970 the models were on display at a museum attached to the @entity36 pub in @entity37 , @entity38			1
the intricate scenes were created by eccentric @entity41 taxidermist @entity40 between 1855 and 1890			1
@entity42 is known about @entity40 's life , but the dioramas he created have a legacy all of their own , and in their heydey were so popular that the platform of the local railway station was expanded to accommodate extra visitors			1
other scenes show a sombre procession of birds walking past a coffin , a group of rats entranced by a game of dominoes , and one particularly bizarre image shows a very dapper monkey taking a ride on a goat			2
learning to multiply : these rabbits have been arranged like pupils in a @entity41 school touching : the animals are given realistic expressions and poses eccentric : the scenes were crafted by @entity40 , pictured holding a stuffed fox when mr @entity40 died in 1918 his descendants took over the museum , but as the @entity41 fashion for stuffed curiosities waned the museum ceased to be a viable business			1
after it was forced to close in its @entity37 location in 1970 , the attraction moved to @entity79 then @entity80 , @entity38 , where it still drew in more than 30,000 a year			1
the collection was then bought up and moved again to @entity83 , where it stayed for almost 20 years			0
but in 2003 this exhibit too was forced to close , and the whole collection went to auction			0
quite the party : one of the scenes shows kittens politely taking afternoon tea sombre : this scene shows two birds carrying a third inside a tiny coffin enclosed : some of the exhibits were shown in ornate displays , such as this curiosity : the museum , pictured in action , was extremely popular with the public of the past when a single buyer for the lots could not be found , the dioramas were sold off individually by @entity104 's , and made more than £ 500,000			1
the tableaux are now scattered across the world in the hands of enthusiasts , but the curious images have been brought back together in a new book , @entity40 's @entity111			1
co-author @entity112 , a 41 - year - old from @entity114 who runs the website @entity116 , spent six months in @entity117 researching the book			0
' these artefacts look utterly bizarre to us now ' , she said			0
parlour game : these squirrels are shown relaxing over a game of cards precision : these rats enjoy a game of dominoes using miniature playing pieces ' but they were once seen as quaint , charming and amusing , fit for the parlour or to delight the family on holiday			2
my two favourites are the @entity135 and the @entity136			0
' they both have this wonderful tension between perversity and a completely over-the - top cuteness			0
each kitten is fully realized as its own character , and rendered with great charm			0
' for a man who was not a particularly skilled taxidermist in the conventional sense , he definitively had a certain gift , and i think you see that most with the kittens			0
' ms @entity112 said mr @entity40 's motivation for making the scenes were unclear , but that it was a much less bizarre occupation in the @entity41 era			1
bizarre : some of the stranger creations include a monkey riding on the back of a goat , left , and a stuffed kitten which was born with two faces , right attraction : the museum , pictured here at its original site in @entity37 , @entity38 , was a big draw she said : ' we know very little about @entity40 and why he made these pieces			1
' but we must remember that at this time , taxidermy was so popular and so much a part of the fabric of daily life that every village had its own practitioner			0
' the fact that @entity40 chose this medium - and that was so popular with a mass audience for around 150 years - is not as bizarre as it seems to the contemporary viewer			2
' he worked in the 19th century , long before the practices of spaying and neutering			0
' cats and dogs simply bred , and kittens and puppies were routinely drowned to dispose of excess numbers , especially in the countryside , where @entity40 lived			2
' there would also have also been an ongoing supply of strange or freak animals-most of which die in infancy - from local farmers who knew @entity40 , his proclivities , and his tiny museum			2

the *surreal* images show kittens marrying , squirrels playing cards and a monkey riding a goat
they are made of animals stuffed by @entity41 eccentric @entity40
he ran a museum in @entity37 , @entity38 , which was open from 1861 to 1970
the tableaux were sold off for over £ 500,000 in 2003
but now the images have been collected in a new book
@entity40 's @entity111 is available in *hardback* for £ 20 .
