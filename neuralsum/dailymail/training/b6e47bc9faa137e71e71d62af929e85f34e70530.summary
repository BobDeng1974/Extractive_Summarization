he may be one of the world 's most composed men - but many have wondered whether his ice cool exterior extends to the golf course			2
now , thanks to three of his playing partners , @entity10 's golf game and his behavior while playing the frustrating sport can finally be revealed			1
and those hoping for a sign of human weakness - such as a club - throwing temper tantrum after pulling a shot left or leaving a putt short - will be sorely disappointed			0
one partner , speaking to the @entity34 , said : ' if you came down from @entity36 and saw his disposition on the golf course , you would think he would be a pretty good president			0
' he 's honest , he keeps his composure through terrible adversity , he 's unruffled , he smiles , and he does n't quit			2
' unlike previous head of state @entity45 , who was not above claiming presidential pardons for lost balls , mr @entity10 scores every shot he takes , one of his playing partners says			1
hard at work : @entity10 , pictured on a putting green outside the @entity51 with vice president @entity52 in 2009 all smiles : the president is said to be as composed on the golf course as he is in politics			2
one playing partner said @entity10 makes fun of himself when he hits a bad shot the president 's love of the sport is well - documented - it is estimated he has spent roughly 1,000 hours playing 214 rounds since he was elected in 2008			1
but his aptitude for the game has remained something of a secret			0
unlike @entity45 , who released his scores to the press , @entity10 's trailing media circus is kept out of sight when he 's on the tee			1
another playing partner who spoke to the @entity34 suggested @entity10 's game has come on leaps and bounds - as a few years ago ' he did n't have a picture - perfect swing '			1
this was backed up by former @entity81 legend @entity80 , a single - figure handicap golfer , who described the president as a ' hack ' player - declining to include him in his dream four - ball match			0
presidential sport : @entity10 plays with former head of state @entity45 ( @entity87 ) and watches his shot during a round of golf at the @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity93 ( r ) and short video clips posted online by people who happened to catch him on a course earlier in his presidency revealed he had bad posture when he stood over the ball			1
he also often made the age old mistake of failing to keep his head down during his swing , golf pros said			0
but his dedicated practice while in office seems to have paid dividend though - as it is rumored @entity10 's scorecard is now regularly hitting the mid- 80s			2
in an interview last august , he described how he had come agonizingly close to ( a 15ft putt ) ' breaking 80 ' - a proud achievement for any amateur golfer			0
improvement : the president 's dedicated practice while in office seems to have paid dividend as it is rumored his scorecard is now regularly hitting the mid- 80s the president embraces former @entity81 player @entity122 as he arrives to play golf at @entity124 in @entity125 , @entity126 in 2013 a third playing partner described the president as a picture of composure on the golf course			1
he said : ' he makes a bad shot , and he makes fun of himself			0
you make a bad shot , and he makes a joke with you			0
he just seems happy to be out there , so the poor play does n't bother him			0
' @entity93 has been one of @entity10 's favorite golfing getaways since being elected - he recently made a sixth visit to the islands since becoming president			1
influential friends : @entity10 is pictured driving a golf buggy at @entity93 's @entity145 with prime minister of new zealand @entity146 in the passenger seat there , his playing partners are a collection of childhood friends , @entity51 officials and the occasional world leader			1
this year he spent an afternoon at the @entity155 course with the @entity157 prime minister , reports @entity158			0
at the end of december , it was also reported that a couple getting married near his vacation spot were forced to move their wedding away from the 16th hole because @entity10 and his friends had planned a round of golf .			2

president 's love of golf well documented with 214 rounds since his election
but his aptitude for sport and playing temperament have remained mystery
