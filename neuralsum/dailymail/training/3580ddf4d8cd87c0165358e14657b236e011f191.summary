by @entity0 published : 17:48 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 17:51 est , 8 july 2013 staying positive : @entity2 , a shopping channel presenter , is experiencing symptoms of post-polio syndrome tv presenter @entity2 has an enviable , toned physique , but when you learn that as a child she was struck with polio , her fitness is even more impressive			1
the infectious disease attacks the nervous system and can lead to paralysis , disability and even death			1
at 14 months old , @entity2 spent 18 weeks in hospital and doctors predicted she would be disabled			2
but her parents refused to accept this			2
incredibly , @entity2 became a dancer and fitness instructor before going into tv			2
' i 've never known if i was always destined to be a tough cookie and that 's why i made a good recovery , or if having polio made me determined , ' says @entity2 , 56 , a @entity30 shopping channel presenter			1
but she has discovered that the disease she thought she 'd overcome more than 50 years ago has a devastating sting in its tail - she 's one of the 80 per cent of patients who , years later , experience a return of the symptoms of muscle loss , cramps , weakness and fatigue known as post-polio syndrome			1
@entity2 does n't remember having polio , but knows she was close to death			1
' in the summer of 1957 my mother noticed i 'd stopped trying to pull myself up and walk and instead just wanted to sit , ' says @entity2 , who lives with her partner @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47 , and has two children , @entity49 , 26 , and @entity50 , 25			2
she was rushed to hospital and put into isolation			2
her parents , six - year - old sister and three - year - old brother could only look at her through a window on visits			2
' to find out how i was , my parents had to read our local paper where there were lists of patients categorised as critically ill , dangerously ill and seriously ill , ' she says			2
' i was on the critically ill list			2
a fortnight later my father saw my name was gone			2
for a terrible moment they thought i had n't made it , until they saw i 'd been moved to “ dangerously ill ”			2
' after six weeks in isolation she was moved to a general ward			0
the polio affected @entity2 's left leg - the muscles had wasted so much it was shorter than the right			1
' i was allowed home on christmas eve with my leg in a calliper			0
the doctors said i 'd always have to wear it , ' says @entity2			0
progress : before the invention of the iron lung , a machine that fills lungs with air by making the chest rise , children with polio died frequently ' but my parents heard about a hospital consultant teaching children who 'd had polio to swim and dance , and signed me up			1
at home my mother spent hours each day doing physiotherapy to strengthen my leg muscles			0
' gradually , @entity2 's leg improved and she started walking without the calliper			0
by the age of 11 , her left leg was strong enough for her not to need special shoes			0
she played tennis and netball , danced and swam			0
today , the only sign she has is a slight limp , and she does n't wear high heels as she has n't got enough control in her ankle to balance in them			0
up to 45,000 people were infected by the poliomyelitis virus during the @entity118 outbreak in the @entity119 , many of them children			1
in the majority of cases , the virus caused minor flu symptoms or ' abortive ' polio - many had it without realising			1
however , 1 per cent of patients developed paralytic polio , says professor @entity130 , a neurologist at the @entity131 in @entity132 , which has a polio clinic			1
' here , the virus attacks the nervous system rather than just the throat , and the patient may become paralysed to such a degree they are unable to move or breathe			0
' before the invention of the iron lung [ a machine that uses air pressure to make the chest rise , so the lungs can fill with air ] , these children would die			0
' thanks to a vaccine programme in the @entity151 , polio has been eradicated , though it remains a problem in @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155			1
but 80 per cent of survivors later experience post-polio syndrome , though doctors do n't know why			1
the symptoms - pain and weakness , fatigue and muscle loss - can strike any time from 15 to 50 years after the initial disease			1
' it may not be that it comes back , but that the recovery of the nervous system against the virus starts to fail as you age , ' says professor @entity171			0
' it 's a terrible double whammy			0
you struggle with this illness and overcome it , then later in life you may end up back in a wheelchair			0
' @entity2 knew nothing about this cruel after - effect until several years ago when , working for a local news station , she interviewed a man with the syndrome			1
' i remember coming home and speaking to @entity45 about it and becoming tearful , ' she says			0
' the thought of polio coming back is really frightening			1
' then , four years ago she noticed her right leg was numb			1
there is no definitive test for post-polio syndrome : diagnosis is based on symptoms			1
' my gp has n't confirmed it 's post-polio syndrome yet , but i think i 'm heading that way , ' says @entity2			1
' i 'm much more tired than i used to be and my left leg is thinner			0
if it gets any worse , i 'll seek professional advice			0
' though there is no cure , there are techniques for managing symptoms , such as mobility aids , and pacing , a type of physical therapy that helps with fatigue by reducing the pace of activity			1
up to 120,000 people in @entity118 are thought to have the condition : 45,000 linked to the @entity119 outbreak , with others affected before and after - the last reported case here was 1982			1
this is as many people as have parkinson 's disease , explains @entity222 , chief executive of the @entity223			2
double misfortune : many who survive polio the first time , like these two women in rehabilitation , will later experience post-polio syndrome he says : ' we 're even seeing some people who had the mild abortive form of polio developing post-polio syndrome with muscle pain and weakness			1
' however , gps do n't recognise post-polio syndrome as well as they could			1
it 's not taught in medical school because polio has been consigned to the history books			2
' as a result , people affected are being told it 's old age , so they may not get the support they need			0
' a survey by the @entity223 found 69 per cent of @entity239 rated their level of awareness of post-polio syndrome as low ; 42 per cent said they would need to refer a suspected case to a neurologist for diagnosis			1
eighteen months ago , @entity2 was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia , which typically develops very slowly , and she is taking chemotherapy tablets			0
' it 's muddied the waters for me as i feel incredibly tired and do n't know whether it 's the leukaemia or post-polio syndrome , ' she says			1
close up : the polio virus			2
up to 120,000 people in @entity118 are thought to have the syndrome ' sometimes everything feels like a real effort and it takes me much longer to recover from exercise , so i 'm having physiotherapy			1
' she wants to raise awareness of post-polio syndrome			1
' if people know they 've got it , they can manage their lives better			0
it 's sad there 's nothing that can be done about it , and it can be degenerative			0
we just do n't know what that might mean for the future			0
i 'm trying to take each day as it comes			0
' in some respects , i feel lucky : i can still walk , do my job , think and write			0
i 'm a positive person , and i 've always had the mantra : “ what does n't kill us makes us stronger			0
” ' @entity223 : britishpolio.org.uk			0
@entity2 has written a book about her life , @entity295 , available through @entity30 or as an e-book .			0
