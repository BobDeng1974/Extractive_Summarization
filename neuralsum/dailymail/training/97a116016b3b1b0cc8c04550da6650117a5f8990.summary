@entity0 sent out a message to the rest of the @entity3 when they demolished @entity4 5 - 0 with a superb exhibition of attacking football at the @entity7			1
wolves had no answer to the movement and invention of @entity0 as @entity12 and @entity13 both scored twice after @entity14 headed the opener to give @entity17 's team their biggest win since march			1
it had been raining steadily throughout the morning and the conditions played a part in @entity0 's opening goal in the 16th minute when a slip by @entity24 forced @entity25 to trip @entity26			2
wolves caught @entity0 out with a corner played to the edge of the box for @entity76 who fired just over and the visitors wasted an even better chance in the 24th minute			2
@entity76 was again involved , drifting past two white shirts before playing in @entity53 who pulled the ball back for @entity81 but he shot high and wide from 10 yards			0
that miss looked even more costly four minutes later when @entity26 chested the ball into the path of @entity12 who made himself enough space to send a low shot fizzing into the bottom right corner from 20 yards			0
@entity76 looked the most likely player to get @entity4 back in the game but some of his team mates were wasteful in their passing and @entity0 all but sealed victory with a third goal in the 42nd minute			0
@entity0 celebrates their second goal in a demolition of @entity97 at @entity98 on saturday @entity13 watches his shot for @entity0 's third goal fly into the back of the net a corner was headed back at the far post and although it was half cleared , @entity13 was allowed to run unchallenged into the area and fire low past @entity50 from 12 yards			1
it was shocking defending from @entity4 who were now looking at damage limitation in the second half although even that was beyond them against a @entity0 team intent on driving home their superiority			1
an exchange of passes across the edge of the @entity4 box ended with @entity26 seeing a shot deflected over but the visitors were opened up again in the 54th minute when @entity38 's clever ball inside allowed @entity12 to score with a measured finish from just inside the area			0
a pumped up @entity13 shows how fired up the @entity123 were as they set about dismantling @entity4 @entity124 struck the foot of a post a minute later but @entity0 were now utterly rampant and they made it five on the hour when @entity35 crossed from the left and @entity13 arrived at the back post to fire into the roof of the net			1
wolves kept going but inevitably it was @entity0 who nearly scored again in stoppage time when @entity136 shot over after @entity50 could only parry a shot from substitute @entity37			2
