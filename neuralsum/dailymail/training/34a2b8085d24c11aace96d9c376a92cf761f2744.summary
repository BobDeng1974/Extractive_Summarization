by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:09 pm on 20th june 2011 for more than ten years it has proved an essential part of @entity5 's search engine			1
but now it seems the technology giant is ditching its trademark ' i 'm feeling @entity11 ' button			0
@entity5 is currently testing out a new user interface design in @entity13 and the button is conspicuous by its absence			1
no more ' i 'm feeling lucky ' ? @entity5 is currently testing out a new user interface design in @entity13 - and the button is conspicuous by its absence ' i 'm feeling lucky ' was designed to take users directly to the first search result , bypassing the search results page			1
there has been no official word yet confirming whether or not it will be permanently removed			0
but since the launch of the @entity25 search last year , the button only works if the user first disables the instant search fuction			1
' i 'm feeling lucky ' was first created to reflect @entity5 's confidence that its top search result would almost always be the one being looked for			2
as @entity5 continues to break new ground at a tremendous rate , perhaps the button is part of an older online mindset			1
earlier today it was confirmed that the company has struck a deal with the @entity36 to put 250,000 books online			0
time - honoured : ' i 'm feeling lucky ' was designed to take users directly to the first search result , bypassing the search results page the works , which are all out of copyright , date from between 1700 and 1870 and have been selected by the library to be digitised by search engine giant			0
the material - some 40million pages - will cover the period that saw the @entity48 , the @entity49 , the @entity50 , the @entity51 , the invention of rail travel and the and of slavery			0
and last week @entity5 unveiled a new feature allowing users to conduct internet searches searches on their personal computers simply with the sound of their voice and without touching a keyboard			2
@entity5 voice search has been available for some time on mobile devices , but now everyone will have the option of searching via voice command from a regular laptop or desktop			2
the only thing needed is a microphone ( either plugged in or internal will do ) and @entity71 .			0

the button is *missing* from a new user interface design @entity5 is testing in @entity13
