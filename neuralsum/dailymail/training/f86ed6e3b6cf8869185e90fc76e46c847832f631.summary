by @entity0 @entity2 trees , giant redwoods and @entity5 red cedars should be planted in @entity7 ’s forests as traditional oaks struggle with climate change , according to research			1
experts have warned that the composition of our woodlands must change to survive rising temperatures , frequent droughts and diseases			2
@entity18 found that unless action is taken , @entity7 ’s forests could shrink by more than 40 per cent by 2080 because of climate change			1
oaks such as these apparently struggle with climate change , according to research foresters are being advised to plant more trees capable of flourishing in warmer temperatures such as the @entity5 red cedar , and giant redwood trees from @entity29 , instead of oaks , pines and spruces			1
more varieties of these trees from the continent will also be grown as well as species from @entity7 in the @entity37 such as @entity38 , small leaved lime and aspen trees , which are also set to return after not being planted for the last few hundred years			1
different varieties of oak and pines that exist in the @entity44 will also be planted			2
scientists at the @entity46 , in the @entity47 , and at @entity18 , the research agency of the @entity18 , estimate that forests could be reduced by 42 per cent by the 2080s because of climate change			1
they studied spruce , pine and oak , which make up 59 per cent of @entity44 forests , and found that new species would be needed to maintain woodlands in the future			2
@entity58 , from the @entity18 told @entity59 : ‘ trees from the continent are used to surviving higher temperatures and drought			0
‘ in @entity66 for example we may be looking at the end of the century at weather similar to that in the @entity70			0
the @entity2 are very good foresters and we can look to source trees from there			2
’ in @entity66 for example we may be looking at the end of the century at weather similar to that in the @entity70 ( above ) giant redwoods like this one should be planted he said native oaks and spruces will not disappear from @entity7 ’s forests , but different varieties will be used			1
he added : ‘ the current oak is not doing very well and we need to look at the range of oak trees available			0
’ there are a lot of native trees that we stopped using because they were not making money			0
for example during the war most of the forests in @entity92 were oak			0
’ he also said there is also a need to diversify @entity7 ’s forests to ensure trees had the best chance of surviving pests and diseases			1
@entity103 , assistant professor at the @entity46 , said : ‘ in the @entity47 we have much less forest production than @entity7			2
' however , we too can expect change : our grandchildren will walk and bike into a different kind of forest than we do now			0
’ giant redwoods are already planted across the @entity44 and are more likely to be used on the east coast which will be warmer , according to mr @entity58			1
he said : ‘ there will be hot drier summers and that ’s what we have to react to			0
‘ for example the @entity117 are likely to have drier summers , which would not suit spruces in the future			0
‘ in the @entity122 we might use some of the southern @entity124 varieties			0

oaks apparently struggle with climate change , according to research
unless action is taken , @entity7 ’s forests could shrink by over 40 *%* by 2080 *due* to climate change
@entity2 trees , giant redwoods and @entity5 red cedars should be planted in @entity7 ’s forests
