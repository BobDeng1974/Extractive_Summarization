‘ there ’s a famous seaside place called @entity2 , that ’s noted for fresh air and fun			1
’ the lines are more than 80 years old , yet still they fix the image of @entity2 in the public mind			1
no matter that the town has fallen on desperately hard times , @entity2 is fresh air and fun , candyfloss and @entity12			1
a fine club , albeit sadly reduced , like the town whose name it bears , yet still the club of @entity19 , @entity20 , gentle @entity21			1
@entity2 supporters are calling for chairman @entity22 to resign after abusive text messages to fans @entity26 has issued an apology for ' any offence or distress caused by my text responses ' @entity26 is the chairman of @entity2 , and among certain affluent circles up there on the @entity35 , he cuts a mighty figure			1
he has money , a robust sense of his own importance , and trenchant opinions , the most recent of which have been directed at a @entity2 supporter named @entity43			1
now i suspect that mr @entity43 is not an especially engaging individual , and the text messages he sent to the chairman may well have been provocative			1
but consider @entity49 ’s responses			1
‘ are you sure we ’ve met ? ’ asks @entity22			1
‘ i would have remembered such a massive retard			1
’ he calls him ‘ an intellectual cripple ’ and tells him to ‘ enjoy the rest of your special needs day out ’			1
he adds : ‘ stop texting f * * * * * * , you should n’t have ever started as you are one tiresome f * * * * * that should spot trains not watch football			2
get a life and consider yourself banned from the stadium			2
’ there is more in similar vein , but you get the drift			2
@entity2 president @entity70 is unhappy with the running of the club and called for @entity49 to resign @entity22 's insults revealed a lot about his character now we need not speculate about the kind of mind which could conjure up phrases like ‘ retard ’ and ‘ cripple ’ , or use ‘ special needs ’ as a spiteful slur			1
such are @entity26 ’s poisonous views , and he is welcome to them			2
but those opinions carry a much wider significance than the trumpeting of a minor clown			2
for in his own town , he is seen as the face of his club			2
far more disturbingly , he is a member of the board of the @entity95 , a body with considerable power and influence			2
in other words , at a time when football at large is making commendable efforts to improve its image and enhance its credibility , a man like @entity22 retains a voice in the governance of the national game			1
@entity22 ’s reaction to the publication of the texts was entirely predictable			1
he made a self - serving apology — ‘ i regret stooping to the level of those threatening and abusing my family ’ — and he announced he would be making a donation to @entity2 ’s @entity118 , which works with organisations supporting disabled people			1
money solves everything , you see ; fill a few pockets and people forget			2
the calculation is as obvious as it is abhorrent			2
in fact , the @entity22 family have a great deal of money , much of it deriving from their association with @entity2			1
@entity2 fans gather outside the stadium to voice their displeasure at the situation at the club the most outrageous example was revealed in these pages by my colleague @entity140			1
following the club ’s sole season in the @entity147 in 2010 - 11 , @entity142 , the chairman ’s father and @entity2 ’s majority shareholder , was paid £ 11million			1
as @entity140 pointed out , this was considerably more than the wage bill for the first - team squad and manager combined			2
such grotesque largesse would have been unacceptable had @entity2 enjoyed some success			1
in fact , they were relegated			0
the club emerged with some £ 40m from that season , but miserably little was spent on improving the team			0
instead , players were allowed to leave in droves , while replacements were sought in the bargain basement			0
a week before the start of the current season , the club employed just eight fully - fledged professional footballers			0
in that same week , i attended a friendly with @entity168			0
the pre-match announcer declared : ‘ the @entity171 team will be : @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 … ’ and so on			0
later , when the substitutes started to arrive , they were identified as , respectively : ‘ @entity177 and 16 , and finally , number 17			0
’ it was like some dark pantomime , an extended practical joke			0
before a ball was kicked , the bookmakers declared them odds - on favourites to be relegated			0
@entity185 scores the only goal of the game as @entity188 beat @entity2 on @entity189 @entity2 , under @entity22 's guidance , are seven points adrift at the bottom of the championship the current @entity193 table tells its own story			1
and all this has happened under the regime of the @entity198 ; the convicted rapist of a father and his odiously offensive son			0
yet i fancy they know that the game is up , that they have known it since tuesday evening , when their shirt sponsors @entity208 said of @entity22 ’s texts : ‘ the comments were unacceptable , something we ’ll be making clear to the club			1
’ a lecture on morality from a legalised loan shark , there can be no more humiliating chastisement			0
the next moves are already taking shape			0
as custodian of the game ’s values , the @entity221 are investigating with a view to taking the strongest measures available to them			0
given the nature of the offence , the @entity95 will come under pressure to remove @entity230 from their board at the earliest opportunity			0
and after such shows of disapproval , the hope must be that a decent football club finds a way of ridding itself of its current owners			0
their departure will come not a moment too soon			0
for that seaside place of fresh air and fun deserves very much better than its obnoxious @entity198			0
@entity246 @entity247 brings out the eloquence in football managers , and 2014 proved a vintage year			0
thus the perceptive @entity250 reflected on @entity251 conceding three goals at @entity253 : ‘ we need to defend better than we did today			0
’ and the equally astute @entity257 , after @entity258 were battered by @entity259 : ‘ you ca n’t go three down to teams of that quality			0
’ but the public speaking prize goes to our old favourite @entity261 , following @entity264 ’s beating at @entity265			0
effortlessly combining two evergreen clichés , he mused : ‘ at this moment in time as a club , we ’re shooting ourselves in the foot			0

@entity2 chairman @entity22 sent abusive text messages to a fan
@entity22 's choice of ' insults ' revealed a lot about his true character
fans have *continuously* called for him to be removed from his position
@entity2 are seven points adrift at the bottom of the championship
