@entity2 's spies tried to recruit an agent in @entity4 who could provide top - secret information on its fledgling nuclear programme , leaked intelligence documents have revealed			1
@entity7 wanted details about the dictatorship ’s plans in a ‘ long - term relationship in return for payment ’			1
the sensitive revelation emerged from a cache of hundreds of secret documents that were leaked to media organisations and published last night			2
asking for help : @entity7 tried to recruit a @entity4 agent , meeting the insider for two hours , this cable shows the electronic files , handed to the @entity24 news agency , could cause embarrassment to @entity2 and other governments in the wake of the revelations two years ago by @entity29			1
the latest disclosures are not on the same scale as those exposed in 2013 by the former @entity34 employee – who is currently in hiding in @entity35 – but they offer a tantalising glimpse into the shadowy world of espionage , focusing on human intelligence rather than digital intelligence			2
spanning a period from 2006 until december 2014 , the digital leak includes detailed briefings and internal analyses written by operatives of @entity47 ’s @entity46			0
they reveal the @entity47 ’ secret correspondence with @entity51 intelligence agency the @entity34 , @entity2 ’s @entity7 , @entity52 ’s @entity50 , @entity35 ’s @entity54 and @entity55 ’s operatives			1
in one document , a cable marked ‘ secret @entity2 / @entity47 eyes only ’ shows that @entity7 , formally referred to as the @entity7 , requested assistance from @entity47 ’s intelligence chiefs to carry out ‘ a joint operation ’			1
@entity62 : the secretive state of @entity4 is ruled with an iron fist by leader @entity65 the aim was to recruit a spy inside the opaque @entity4 decision - making system			2
an undated cable was sent from an @entity7 operative to @entity47 ‘ requesting your support to assist our officer ’			1
it said @entity7 would intercept the @entity4 while in transit between flights in @entity47 ‘ and encourage him to accept a long - term relationship with @entity7 ’			1
capability : the foundations of a nuclear power plant are laid in @entity4 in august 2002 it asked @entity47 to ‘ provide covert surveillance to identify [ @entity86 ] on his arrival … and securely house him whilst our officer makes contact			1
’ the @entity2 agency also requested the @entity47 ensured the @entity7 officer and the @entity4 target were ‘ not interrupted by any of his colleagues ’			1
@entity7 wrote : ‘ the involvement of @entity47 ’s authorities would not be apparent to the target – our officer would appear to be acting alone			2
’ the secret cable also reveals that an @entity7 officer had approached the target a year earlier , held a two - hour meeting with him and offered an undisclosed amount of money in exchange for ‘ a long - term clandestine relationship ’			1
the target had ‘ stated that he would be happy to meet the officer again under secure circumstances , ’ @entity7 wrote			2
‘ but a year has passed without us hearing ’ from him , the cable added			0
the @entity2 spies added that they regarded this as an ‘ unusual opportunity , which , if successful , could greatly assist our ongoing efforts to gain coverage of @entity4 proliferation activity ’			2
the leaked documents do not disclose whether or not the @entity47 agreed to provide the assistance requested by @entity7 or if the plan was a success			2
other documents revealed that : the case of @entity50 , the @entity52 intelligence service , contradicting prime minister @entity125 came after he made a theatrical 2012 speech to the @entity128			1
@entity125 urged military action against @entity55 so it would ' dismantle its nuclear weapons programme altogether '			2
the @entity52 prime minister even held up a cartoon bomb to show how close @entity55 was to being capable of a nuclear attack - adding it could happen in a matter of months			1
but just a month after his speech in september 2012 , agents for the @entity52 intelligence service @entity50 admitted @entity55 was not preparing any nuclear weapons			1
threat : a leaked report , apparently by @entity52 spies , appears to contradict the @entity52 prime minister @entity125 's 2012 speech warning @entity55 was close to a nuclear weapon - in which he held up a cartoon bomb @entity146 : one line in the report said @entity55 was allocating its most heavily - enriched uranium to a research reactor the leaked @entity50 report said although there was a ' significant increase ' in the amount of uranium @entity55 had enriched , the country did ' not appear ready ' to enrich uranium at the highest rate			1
it said @entity55 had around 100kg of uranium enriched to 20 per cent purity			0
although such uranium can be used to make a bomb , weapons more commonly use uranium at 90 per cent purity , according to the @entity166			0
the report said : ' the quantity of material enriched to 20 per cent is not increasing at this stage as some is being converted to nuclear fuel			0
document : the report , pictured , is one of hundreds of cables obtained by @entity24 and the @entity177 @entity146 : the report featured a ' bottom line ' , which @entity52 officials have argued did follow @entity125 's warning ' even though @entity55 has accumulated enough 5 per cent enriched uranium for several bombs , and has enriched some of it to 20 per cent , it does not appear to be ready to enrich it to higher levels			1
' it is allocating some of it to produce nuclear fuel for the @entity189 [ @entity190 ] , and the amount of 20 per cent enriched uranium is therefore not increasing			0
' bottom line : though @entity55 at this stage is not performing the activity necessary to produce weapons , it is working to close gaps in areas that appear legitimate such as enrichment , reactors , which will reduce the time required to produce weapons from the time the instruction is actually given			0
' the report 's disclosure has come at a critical time for relations between the @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity55			2
@entity125 is due to address the @entity208 next tuesday , and many expect him to make another hardline stand about @entity55 's nuclear programme			1
in the meantime the @entity51 is playing a leading role in the international bid to introduce more controls over @entity55 's nuclear programme , which led to ' constructive ' talks today in @entity217 , @entity218			1
@entity55 insists it only uses nuclear technology for civilian power plants , not weapons			0
but in his 2012 speech to the @entity128 , the @entity52 prime minister referred casually to @entity55 's ' first bomb '			1
' the relevant question is not when @entity55 will get the bomb , ' he said			0
' the relevant question is at what stage we can we no longer stop @entity55 from getting the bomb			0
the red line must be drawn			0
' showing a cartoon bomb to the world representatives , he said : ' this is a bomb , this is a fuse			0
innocent : @entity55 has insisted it is only enriching uranium for civilian purposes , not weapons , but the claim is disbelieved by @entity52			2
pictured : then - president @entity241 tours an enrichment plant in 2008 caught in the middle : @entity51 president @entity244 ( centre ) must balance his firm alliance with @entity52 prime minister @entity125 ( left ) with negotiations with @entity55 president @entity249 ( right ) ' in the case of @entity55 's nuclear plans to build a bomb , this " bomb " has to be filled with enough enriched uranium and @entity55 has to go through three stages			1
' @entity55 's completed the first stage			2
it took them many years but they completed it and they 're 70 per cent of the way there			0
now they 're well into the second stage '			0
he added stage two would be complete by summer 2013 and said : ' from there it 's only a few months , possibly a few weeks , before they get enough enriched uranium for the first bomb			0
' what i 've told you is not based on secret information			0
it 's not based on military intelligence			0
it 's based on the public reports of the @entity278			0
' one senior @entity52 government official hit back over the leaked reports - telling the @entity177 that there was no contradiction between the report and the prime minister 's 2012 speech			1
both said that @entity55 was increasing the rate at which it was enriching uranium , the official said			0
relationship : @entity125 , pictured in the @entity291 with @entity244 in october , will address @entity208 next week another of the leaked cables claimed @entity244 ' threatened ' @entity295 leader @entity294 over his bid to win formal statehood for @entity298			1
the memo , dated november 22 , 2012 , referenced ' a phone call made between @entity244 and @entity301 where @entity244 threatened pres. @entity294 if he goes ahead with the @entity128 bid			1
' it added @entity295 officials were ' adamant ' about pushing through their bid to be recognised at the @entity128			1
one intelligence contact said his family - who lived in @entity311 - said there was ' no place safe in the whole of @entity311			0
they are like trapped rats on a boat '			0
another memo claimed a @entity34 agent had seemed to be ' desperate to make inroads into @entity321 in @entity311 ' - which if true would breach a government ban on contact with the @entity325 movement			0
@entity295 officials failed in their bid to be recognised in december when it was blocked by the @entity326			2
@entity2 mps voted to support the bid , but the @entity2 was only one of 15 countries on the @entity326 , of which at least nine had to back @entity295 statehood for it to pass			1
the application won the support of eight members of the @entity326 , falling short by just one			0
the @entity51 - which has a right of veto on the influential body - also voted against the move .			0

@entity7 had 2 - hour meeting with @entity4 ' target ' and offered payment
undated cable asked @entity47 spies for help with ' joint operation '

@entity125 said @entity55 was close to a bomb - but spies said country was *n't*
@entity244 is also said to have ' threatened ' @entity298 's bid for @entity128 statehood
@entity52 spies appeared to contradict their own prime minister 's *dramatic* claim that @entity55 was close to having a nuclear bomb
@entity371 intelligence targeted the leader of @entity373
@entity47 agents spied on @entity35 over a *£* *65million* joint *satellite* deal
@entity2 officials helped block the sale of equi*pm*ent by a @entity47 company to @entity55
