in space , no - one can hear you scream			2
and that 's the main problem former astronaut @entity2 has with @entity4 's latest sci - fi film after @entity5			1
a day after attending the @entity9 première of the post-apocalyptic thriller , the second man to walk on the @entity7 said the film was a great family drama			1
but , he complained , the space scenes were unrealistic			2
' there was a lot of noise			0
in space , you do n't get that much noise , ' he said			1
' in space , you do n't get that much noise ' : @entity2 , centre , with @entity25 , left , and @entity4 , right , whose latest movie the former astronaut said was a great drama marred only by unrealistic space scenes ' @entity30 does n't propagate in a vacuum ' : @entity2 , pictured left , and right with a guest , said he enjoyed the father - son dynamic between @entity4 and @entity25 , but said there was too much ' shoot'em - up ' for his taste family affair : from left , @entity25 , @entity39 , @entity4 , @entity40 and @entity4 pose for pictures at the ' after @entity5 ' première at @entity44 in @entity9 stars of the show : @entity25 and @entity4 strike a pose in front of the after @entity5 promo poster @entity2 , who followed @entity51 onto the surface of the moon during the historic @entity55 landing in 1969 , explained that ' noise does n't propagate in a vacuum			1
' ' fortunately , we were free of static			0
we could communicate with each other pretty clearly , and mission control , though we were 50,000 miles away , ' he said			0
the 83 - year old former space man was the guest of honour at an event for a new luxury camera from @entity68			1
the @entity70 company has supplied cameras used in space missions for more than 50 years			0
@entity2 said he enjoyed the father - son dynamic between @entity4 and son @entity25 , but thought there was a little too much ' shoot'em - up ' for his taste			1
' i hope the aliens are more peaceful than they are in this film , wherever they are , ' @entity2 joked			1
father - son dynamic : the @entity84 play a father and son team sent back to @entity5 a thousand years after humanity fled the planet due to numerous environmental catastrophes adventure : the pair crash land on the surface of the planet , losing their colleagues in the process , and it is up to @entity25 to make a perilous journey across uncharted land and signal for help not well received : @entity102 's @entity101 said : ' most of the film consists of @entity104 ( @entity25 ) traveling miles on foot to recover a rescue beacon , and then trying to find the intergalactic equivalent of a cellphone signal in space no - one can hear you scream because sounds are carried in the form of compression waves , meaning that they must travel through a medium such as air			1
when we hear a sound caused by a slamming door , for example , what happens is that the impact of the door on its frame compresses nearby air molecules and this compression propagates through the air until it reaches our ears			0
in space , however , the environment is a virtual vacuum , with hardly any molecules for the sound to pass through			1
those molecules that are around are extremely far apart			0
so , if you were to slam a door in space , the impact would more than likely not affect any neighbouring molecules and , even if it did , those molecules would not be near to any others to form a wave			0
that means the vibration of the slamming door would not travel to your ear and you would hear nothing			0
or , as @entity2 rather succinctly put it : ' noise does n't propagate in a vacuum ' however , @entity2 's enthusiasm for after @entity5 's dramatic quality has not been shared by film critics , who have lambasted the movie			1
the @entity84 play a father and son team sent back to @entity5 a thousand years after humanity fled the planet due to numerous environmental catastrophes			2
unfortunately they end up badly damaging their spaceship in an asteroid field , and as the rest of the @entity165 troops travelling alongside them die when they crash land , it is up to @entity25 to make a perilous journey across uncharted land and signal for help			0
in his one star review of the film , the @entity102 's @entity101 says : ' most of the film consists of @entity104 ( @entity25 ) travelling miles on foot to recover a rescue beacon , and then , even less interestingly , trying to find the intergalactic equivalent of a cellphone signal			2
' and @entity180 's @entity179 had his knife out for the stars ' acting , claiming : ' the senior @entity4 gives one of the least substantive performances of his career , while the undeniably charismatic @entity25 toggles between two primary modes of expression : paralysing fear and simmering rage			0
' the @entity192 's @entity191 is even more scathing in his assessment of the teenager , arguing he ' spends much of the movie running around in a panic , waving his little arms at predators and shouting , “ leave me alone ! ” ' it ’s appropriate to the character , i guess			0
but it ’s also more than mildly annoying			0
@entity203 comes across as a whiny , wilful and one - dimensional brat			0
' the @entity55 team : from left , @entity51 , @entity207 and @entity2 pose in this file photo ' magnificent desolation ' : @entity2 pictured on the surface of the @entity7 during the 1969 @entity55 mission despite the critics ' scathing assessments , and his own admission that he preferred the more realistic sci - fi work of @entity218 , @entity2 said he was impressed by the set design of earth 1,000 years into the future			1
' the scenes of the cities were really remarkable , ' @entity2 said			2
that differed significantly from his experience on the @entity7			2
' the place was just totally lifeless , and that prompted me to use the words , " magnificent desolation " in contrast to the magnificent experience that humanity could move itself ahead to get to the @entity7 , ' @entity2 said			1
' and as @entity51 says , that was sort of a small step for man , but to me the giant leap is establishing permanence on another planet			0
' @entity2 wants it to be @entity244 , but feels it wo n't happen in his lifetime , unless he 's ' really , really long - lived			1

' @entity30 does n't propagate in a vacuum , ' the former space man explains
he met the @entity84 when he attended the @entity9 première of the film
critics have panned the film , but @entity2 said it was a great family drama
@entity2 was the second man to set foot on the @entity7 in 1969
