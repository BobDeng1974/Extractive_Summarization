by @entity0 an impending ' health crisis ' is threatening the @entity3 as the majority of people entering old age are overweight , experts said today			1
new figures show almost three quarters of people aged 45 to 74 in @entity10 are either overweight or obese			1
young adults are the only age group which have a normal average body mass index ( @entity14 ) , according to the statistics from the @entity16			1
the @entity17 today warned a large proportion of the population will face significant problems as they enter old age			1
experts have warned of a ' looming health crisis ' as more people enter old age overweight or obese being overweight or obese can lead to a number of potentially life - threatening conditions including type 2 diabetes , coronary heart disease , some types of cancer , such as breast cancer and bowel cancer , and stroke			1
@entity33 of the @entity17 said : ' these figures show that there is a looming health crisis for the nation			1
' if you think that obesity is just for the young and the middle aged then you are wrong			0
' there needs to be a clear message that everybody needs to take control and watch what they are eating			0
' he warned that many overweight elderly people are in a ' @entity49 ' situation because they are suffering a combination of problems linked to being overweight and muscle wastage - so they can not exercise to improve their health			1
the @entity16 figures show that there is a rising tide in the proportion of people who are overweight or obese			1
at least seven in 10 people in @entity10 aged 45 and over are either overweight or obese			1
and the average @entity14 measurement of those aged 45 to 74 is 28.3 - those with a @entity14 of 25 to 29.9 are considered to be overweight			2
professor @entity65 , a geriatrician from @entity67 and @entity16 lead clinician , said : ' obesity is going to have a lot of short to medium effects around diabetes and heart disease			0
' and then you have got long term issues because your body will be carrying around a lot more weight , you then go on to suffer problems such as arthritis and having difficulty breathing			0
new figures released today by the @entity16 reveal that almost three quarters of 45 to 74 year olds in @entity10 are either overweight or obese ' there is a whole set of second - order things as a consequence of weight			2
' when asked what impact the growing number of overweight and obese older people will have on society , he said : ' there are potentially a number of scenarios , one is that you get less older people because they get illnesses ( as a result of ) obesity younger and therefore there is a mortality effect			2
' the second possibility is that the life expectancy of older people plateaus and starts to drop			0
' the third possible interpretation is that the disability - free life expectancy starts to shorten			0
but i do n’t have enough evidence to say which one or combination of those scenarios could happen			0
' the proportion of people entering old age being either obese or overweight could lead to a ' health crisis ' , experts have warned			1
the below figures show the proportion of the population in different age groups who are overweight or obese , and the average body mass index ( @entity14 ) of people in that age bracket			1
people are deemed to be of normal weight if they have a @entity14 score of 18.5 to 24.9 and overweight with a score of over 25			1
those with a @entity14 over 30 are deemed to be obese			2
@entity135 warned that public health measures are mostly aimed at younger and not older people			0
@entity138 , health influencing programme director at the charity , said : ' historically public health approaches have been very focused on children and it ’s all about getting them while they are young and if you are old then " it ’s a bit late to bother "			0
' there is a really important need to turn some of that around and actually start talking to people about how it ’s never too late to adopt healthy behaviours			0
' she said just a ' tiny ' proportion of older people get the recommended amounts of exercise , adding : ' in the 75 - plus population it ’s something as low as four per cent of people getting their recommended weekly amounts of exercise so we do have a really big issue here with obesity and inactivity			2
' the new @entity16 data , which focuses on the health and care of older people also shows that the population aged 65 and over is rapidly rising			2
in 1951 , 4.5 million people were aged 65 and above but by 2051 this number is expected to rise to 16.6 million			0
while people in this age bracket account for just one in six of the population , they take up one in every two hospital beds , the figures show			1
@entity179 , chief executive of charity @entity180 , said : ' these figures show that older people are the main users of the @entity3 and are most likely to be affected by any cuts in services as a result of funding problems			1
' if we are going to expect more older people to get treated outside of hospital , we need realistic levels of funding for councils to provide community care			0
' dr @entity192 , chief nutritionist at @entity10 ( @entity193 ) , said : ' there is no easy answer to reducing obesity ; it is a complex issue that requires action at individual , family , local and national levels			0
being overweight or obese increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes , heart disease and certain cancers			2
' excess weight can also be associated with low self - esteem and mental health issues			0
@entity193 is committed to helping tackle overweight and obesity in adults of all ages through a range of approaches that support action on the local environment to make eating less and being more physically active easier , with many local authorities already working hard to achieve this			0

new figures show a rising tide of people who are overweight or obese
young adults are the only age group with a normal @entity14
obese ageing population ' will face significant problems as they enter old age '
