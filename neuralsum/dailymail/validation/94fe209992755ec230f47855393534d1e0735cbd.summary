@entity1 's first dedicated hedgehog conservation area is launched today in an attempt to slow the species ’ dramatic decline			1
the number of hedgehogs in the country are estimated to have dropped 40 per cent in the last two decades			0
conservationists have created a ‘ hedgehog improvement area ’ which opens today in @entity10 , the @entity11			2
a group of volunteers will manage the green space , helping to establish a central sanctuary from which it is hoped the hedgehog population will be able to disperse and inhabit the surrounding countryside			0
but @entity28 , hedgehog officer for @entity18 , said people across the country can do far more to help by taking simple measures in their own back gardens			2
part of the reason that hedgehogs have decline so far is thought to be linked to the widespread loss of bushes and hedges , which have been replaced in many back gardens by hard wooden or metal fences			1
hard barriers make it impossible for hedgehogs to move from place to place - if they are isolated in smaller and smaller areas of greenery , they can not feed or mate			0
mr @entity28 said : ‘ something as basic as linking up a series of small isolated green patches with a hole no bigger than the size of a cd is a remarkably powerful and positive action for hedgehog conservation			1
the number of hedgehogs in the country are estimated to have dropped 40 per cent in the last two decades ( file picture ) ‘ making these connections between our own fenced - in islands of green spaces creates a continuous habitat corridor through which hedgehogs can forage , seek shelter and even rendezvous with potential mates			0
’ @entity70 , chief executive of the @entity1 @entity71 , which is backing the project , said : ‘ we are delighted to be funding such an exciting and important project in @entity18 that will hopefully benefit many hedgehogs			1
‘ simple measures such as ensuring there is a five inch square gap in boundary walls and fences make a massive difference to local hedgehog populations			0
‘ there are many ways people can assist this declining species and we hope this project will complement our work to highlight the plight of the hedgehog			2
