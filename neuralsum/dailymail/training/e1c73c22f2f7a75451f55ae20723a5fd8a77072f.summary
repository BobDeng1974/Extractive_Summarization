girls who drink more than one sugary drink a day are likely to start having periods sooner , say scientists			1
a new study of almost 6,000 adolescent girls links the consumption of sugary drinks to earlier menstruation			1
the research found those drinking more than 1.5 sugar - sweetened beverages a day had their first period 2.7 months earlier than those consuming two a week or fewer			1
the discovery is important as the risk of getting breast cancer later in life increases when periods start early			1
@entity28 lead researcher dr @entity27 , from @entity29 , said ‘ our study adds to increasing concern about the widespread consumption of sugar - sweetened drinks among children and adolescents in the @entity28 and elsewhere			1
‘ the main concern is about childhood obesity , but our study suggests that age of first menstruation ( menarche ) occurred earlier , independently of body mass index , among girls with the highest consumption of drinks sweetened with added sugar			2
‘ these findings are important in the context of earlier puberty onset among girls , which has been observed in developed countries and for which the reason is largely unknown			0
’ a one year reduction in age at first period is estimated to raise breast cancer risk by five per cent			1
the impact of bringing forward menarche by 2.7 months was likely to be ‘ modest ’ said the scientists			2
but they expected some girls to be consuming more sugary drinks than reported which would lead to an ‘ even more dramatic ’ drop in the age of menstruation			1
the researchers said there could be significant public health implications and , importantly , it was possible to encourage less sugary drink consumption			0
altogether 5,583 girls were included in the research , drawn from a @entity28 - wide growing up today study , says a report published in the journal @entity73 ( must credit )			2
questionnaires were used to ask the girls about their diets at several points between 1996 and 2001 , and collect information about what they drank			0
a drink serving was defined as either a can or a glass			0
sugary drinks included drinks such as @entity85 and @entity86 , sodas , fruit drinks , lemonade , iced tea and the powder mix @entity92			2
the study found no link with fruit juices or diet colas with added sweeteners			0
by the end of the five year period , all but three per cent of the girls had started menstruating			0
the average first period age for girls consuming the most sugary drinks was 12.8 years compared with 13 years for those drinking the least			1
the average first period age for girls consuming the most sugary drinks was 12.8 years compared with 13 years for those drinking the least			1
after taking account of @entity107 ( @entity107 ) , girls drinking the most were 22 per cent more likely to start their period in the month after being questioned about their diet than the lowest consumers			2
the researchers found artificially added sugar was chiefly responsible for their findings rather than natural sugars in fruit juices			0
drinks with added sugar can lead to rapid ‘ spikes ’ of the hormone insulin			0
boosted insulin can result in higher concentrations of sex hormones , and large changes in the levels of these have been linked to periods starting earlier , said the scientists			0
dr @entity129 , from the @entity130 at @entity131 , said ‘ this is a very large study , which was representative across the @entity28 , and the findings are strongly statistically significant			1
‘ from previous research we know that sugar - sweetened beverages ( @entity138 ) intake promotes weight gain , and that weight gain promotes early puberty in girls			0
‘ the surprise here is the claim that the association is independent of childhood size - there is a more direct effect of @entity138 on puberty			0
’ prof @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity131 , questioned whether a difference of 2.7 months was ‘ biologically relevant ’			2
he said ‘ the authors admit that future studies should examine the impact of early childhood nutrition on menarche			0
‘ it seems to me that the observation in this study suggests that it is weight related so that the message is clear about the dangers of such sugary drinks			1
’ a spokeswoman for the @entity166 @entity165 ( @entity167 ) , said : ' neither this study nor the body of science shows that sugar - sweetened beverage consumption causes early onset of menstruation			0
' what the body of science supports is that adolescent girls are reaching puberty earlier than prior generations ; however , there is no scientific consensus concerning the cause of this trend			1

those drinking 1.5 sugary drinks a day had first period 2.7 months earlier
breast cancer risk increase when periods start early in adolescent girls
almost 6,000 girls took part in the five year study in the @entity28
experts described the findings as ' significant '
