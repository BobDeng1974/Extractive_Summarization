the 33 - year - old said the trio had arranged to meet a friend inside the bar but when they tried to walk in , they were held back by security staff who said it was too full			1
@entity4 claims she was enjoying a night out with friends and decided to head to the @entity8 bar a shot from the interior of the bar which is alleged to have turned @entity4 and her friends away ' after a while a group of lads went in and the doormen said it was because there were too many women in and they try to balance the ratio so we thought " fine " , ' @entity4 said			1
however , the mother - of - one claims she and her friends became suspicious when they saw some other women walking straight into the bar			1
' then a group of women went in and we said " hang on what ’s going on ? " and he turned to us and said " look , you ’re too big and ugly to come in , i suggest you try elsewhere "			2
' i could n’t believe what i ’d just heard and asked him if he could say it again to make sure - he repeated " you ’re too fat , you ’re not getting in "			2
' i know i ’m not exactly a supermodel , but i ’ve never known anything like it in terms of customer service , ' she said			0

it was so uncalled for and i ’ve never had anything so humiliating happen to me in my whole life			0
' for us the night was completely ruined and we just went home			0
