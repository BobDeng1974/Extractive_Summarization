they were the heartbreaking scenes of a family being torn apart : four young sisters being dragged kicking and screaming from their mother 's home in the middle of the night			1
the story was that the girls had been taken from their abusive father back in @entity9 to hide out in @entity10 and now they were being sent back to the ' monster ' against their will			1
the scenes of the girl 's forced return caused widespread outcry , particularly as the girls ' mother portrayed the cruelty of the @entity20 , and the girls - then aged nine to 14 years old - frightened and distraught			1
what had been lost in the drama was the fact that the four sisters had earlier been taken by their mother from @entity9 without the knowledge or permission of that father , @entity33 , and that the girls had been born in @entity9 and spent the greater part of their young lives there			1
now 60 minutes has returned to the village near @entity79 where the girls have been living with their @entity9 @entity20 and interview the two elder girls , @entity82 and @entity83 and talked to them about their lives and the dramatic circumstances in which they were apparently wrenched from their mother , @entity58			1

despite claims by the girls ' mother than they were not happy in @entity9 , the sisters now seem settled and leading good lives with father @entity55 the dramatic turn in the lives of the @entity33 girls began in 2010 , when they left @entity9 ostensibly just for month 's holiday back in @entity10 , with their mother 's family on the @entity27 in @entity126			1
@entity58 and @entity33 had met when she was a schoolgirl and had gone to @entity9 as an exchange student			0
her host family was @entity55 's parents and @entity58 and @entity55 fell in love			0
@entity58 became pregnant and the pair married			0
ms @entity58 gave birth to four healthy girls , but in 2007 when the youngest was only around four years old she split from @entity55			0
under @entity9 law , both parents were granted equal custody			2
in 2010 , @entity58 told @entity55 she wanted to take the girls back to @entity10 for a vacation			2
ms @entity58 told the @entity10 embassy in @entity9 entirely different story , that she was fleeing an abusive husband and father and she needed their assistance			2
once back in @entity10 , ms @entity58 and her daughters settled down to life in @entity126 for two years , until the dramatic scenes which saw them returned to @entity9			2
now aged twelve to 17 , the young women behave in complete contrast to the screaming , hysterical girls captured on camera in 2012			0
just a day after being taken to their father 's villa on the outskirts of @entity79 , the two older girls were filmed running to the front gates when they saw media camped outside and pleaded for reporters to help them return to @entity10			2
the eldest girl was taken back inside by her father , while her sister clung to the gate as her grandmother urged her to return inside			0
she held onto the gate for an hour , during which local police and social workers arrived			0
the girls had not seen their mother since they left @entity10 , but after @entity170 went to @entity9 to film the story , @entity58 has subsequently turned up for a three - day visit			1
ms @entity58 has previously said in the years since her daughter 's return to @entity9 that the girls were unhappy			0
' they do n't seem to be settling , ' she said in 2013			0
' i keep getting constant requests from them to come home			0
