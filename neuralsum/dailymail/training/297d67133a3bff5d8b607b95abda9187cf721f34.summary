by @entity0 published : 06:45 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 05:26 est , 5 march 2014 coalition relations are under growing strain after @entity4 led a @entity6 ambush on the @entity7 – insisting the government should enshrine in law a pledge for an @entity12 referendum			1
at a @entity15 meeting to determine the government ’s programme for the year ahead , the chancellor and work and pensions secretary @entity13 demanded an @entity18 , which has repeatedly been rejected by @entity7			0
the plan was immediately turned down by deputy prime minister @entity20 and education minister @entity21 , whose party opposes @entity6 plans for an in / out referendum on @entity12 membership by 2017			1
@entity6 chancellor @entity4 demanded an @entity26 be included in the @entity27 , but deputy prime minister @entity20 has rejected the idea of legislating for an in - out vote @entity30 then sprung a further surprise on the @entity7 by declaring that legislation to allow constituents to trigger a ‘ recall ’ vote on errant mps – which mr @entity20 has attempted to blame the prime minister for killing off – should go ahead			1
in another sign of coalition bad blood , mr @entity30 was also accused of ‘ stealing ’ an announcement from @entity43 dem business secretary @entity42 on the government ’s acceptance of a recommendation that the minimum wage should rise to £ 6.50 an hour			2
the chancellor ’s aides were said to have been in talks with @entity7 officials yesterday morning about the timing of mr cable making the announcement , only for the prime minister to steal his thunder in a speech on the economy hours later			1
prime minister @entity30 also surprised the @entity7 by saying would now support giving voters the power to oust mps under pressure from the @entity62 , @entity30 used a speech in january last year to set out his plan to renegotiate a ' fresh settlement ' with @entity66 , clawing back powers to @entity68			1
if he is prime minister after the next election he would then hold an in - out referendum			1
the in / out referendum would take place before 2017 , halfway through the 2015 - 20 @entity72			2
the @entity73 also drew up a backbench @entity18 which would legislate for a referendum , but this has been killed off by opposition from @entity78 and the @entity7 in the @entity79			2
now the @entity73 want it included in the @entity27 this year , something the @entity7 would block			0
‘ this is the @entity7 getting a taste of their own medicine , ’ said one senior @entity6			0
‘ if they do n’t want to let people have a say on @entity88 then we are going to rub their noses in it again and again			0
’ earlier this year , @entity78 and the @entity7 conspired to kill off a @entity6 mp ’s backbench bill , supported by the party leadership , which would commit the government to holding an @entity12 referendum by 2017			2
mr @entity30 has pledged to hold such a vote if he remains prime minister after the next election			1
but the @entity73 say the commitment should be enshrined in legislation to assure sceptical voters and have attacked @entity78 and the @entity7 as ‘ enemies of democracy ’ for refusing to support it			0
they insist the vast majority of voters want a say on @entity12 membership			0
mr @entity4 used yesterday ’s cabinet meeting to agree the contents of the forthcoming @entity27 , to express dismay that the @entity7 are withholding support for a referendum bill and insist he believed it should be included			0
sources said that he told the @entity15 meeting that it should be up to the public to decide on the issue			0
one senior @entity7 source said : ‘ raising this at this stage is a nakedly transparent attempt to generate some controversy to appease angry @entity6 backbenchers in the run - up to the @entity128 elections			0
’ mr @entity30 also said the @entity27 would include a ‘ right of recall ’ measure , letting voters trigger a by - election if their mp was involved in serious wrongdoing .			1
