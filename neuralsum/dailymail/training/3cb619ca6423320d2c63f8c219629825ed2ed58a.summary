each winter , the @entity1 crisis takes the same form : @entity5 departments across the country overwhelmed , the target for patients to be seen within four hours broken , operations cancelled			1
add to that reports of ambulances being unable to deliver their charges on arrival into casualty departments , and you have the usual sad winter litany of a health service at bay			1
each time , doctors and nurses struggle through			0
but each time , it takes us one step closer to a nightmare scenario – the collapse of perhaps the nation ’s most cherished institution			0
but in my view , nothing short of a revolution is required – a radical rescue plan to save the @entity1 from financial meltdown and to take it out of day - to - day party political control			1
sadly , i see no such plan from either the @entity40 under @entity41 or , i regret to say , my own party under @entity43			0
instead , where we should see far - sighted vision , we are getting sticking plasters and short - term palliatives to hide the problem until post-election			2
it ’s as if our political leaders are too scared to tell the truth or , to put it another way , the doctor is too timid to tell the patient how bad their condition really is			0
the health service is facing potentially its worst financial crisis in its 66 - year history			1
by 2020 , on current plans , there will be a £ 30 billion shortfall in its budget			1
the figure is already known			0
it has been flagged up now for months			0
the causes are also well known			0
we ’re an ageing population			1
while longer lifespans are one of the blessings of the age , they come at huge cost as older people use the health service more			1
crisis : @entity29 said the health service is facing potentially its worst financial crisis in its 66 - year history also , the advances in medicine now being realised come at a huge cost			1
what was untreatable 40 years ago is now curable – but at a price			0
less exciting , but just as important in budget terms , inflationary pressures always hit the @entity1 harder than much of the rest of the public sector			1
so while the @entity100 has in principle protected health service spending and ring - fenced it from wider cutbacks , in real terms , its budget has been cut			1
if all that was n’t bad enough , we know that even after five years of austerity , further massive public spending cutbacks await whoever holds the keys to no 10 @entity113 after the @entity114 in may			0
therefore , without radical treatment , the prospects for the @entity1 are not just bleak , they are catastrophic			1
if nothing is done , within a few short years , the health service as we know it will have ceased to exist			1
@entity5 departments will not just be overstretched , they will be unrecognisable			0
instead of queues reaching to the waiting room doors , they will be stretching into the streets			0
waiting lists will grow like @entity125 and slashing the number of operations will be standard			0
gp services will have to be drastically reduced as their budgets are slashed			0
a growing number of hospitals will go bankrupt and staff , dedicated and highly trained , laid off			0
in other hospitals , regimes reminiscent of the disgraceful events in @entity135 will be in place , with patients left un-nursed and unfed for long periods of time			0
such a scenario , one would have thought , would now be igniting the most intense debate between the @entity144 and @entity145 parties on how this catastrophe can be averted			0
but that thought would be wrong			0
both major parties hope to get past may 7 without any serious debate with you , the electorate , on the existential crisis facing our @entity1			1
if they are planning to avert this national calamity , it is being kept well under wraps			0
in my own party ’s case , time is running out as far as our traditional polling advantage on the @entity1 is concerned			1
one poll shows that @entity41 is more trusted than @entity43 on safeguarding the @entity1			1
@entity145 is now promising to publish radical plans to put the @entity1 on a financially sustainable footing			1
but so far , the party shows no signs of facing up to the scale of the challenge			2
they intend to use money from a mansion tax , a crackdown on hedge funds and a levy on tobacco firms but this will simply not cover the £ 30 billion deficit			1
quite simply , the way we fund the @entity1 needs to be revolutionised – starting with a serious increase in national insurance contributions that will raise a huge proportion of the necessary cash			2
i suspect both parties know such a genuinely radical move is necessary ; they are just scared of being the first to say so			0
but why ? poll after poll says the electorate is up for contributing more money , not only to stave off a health catastrophe , but to help to reshape the @entity1 to match their needs in the @entity195			1
in fact , one survey showed that 60 per cent of voters were happy to pay more			0
that is why i propose that the extra cash the @entity1 desperately needs should be levied through a reformed @entity202 system			2
a rise of one per cent in @entity202 contributions will raise £ 15 billion over the next five years – half the impending health service deficit			1
but to save the @entity1 , we have to go further			1
we should do nothing short of split off the health service from day - to - day political control to create an @entity211 – one truly owned and run by the people through a new national mutual , of which we will all be members			1
we would elect our own trustees and they would be responsible for spending the @entity1 budget , pushing through reforms and settling with us what future contributions should be			1
pushing through reforms would be a key part of that new @entity1 mutual ’s responsibilities and would deliver the productivity increases needed to meet the other half of the @entity1 deficit			2
and those reforms are crucial as the new @entity1 must realise more quickly than the old version that it can not always expect taxpayers to stump up any money for any bill presented			2
it must also recognise that it can no longer deliver a world - class service through institutions devised by the @entity233 for an age when there were few treatments and even fewer drugs			2
this age of the dominance of hospitals has to end			0
many health staff are better located in easy - to - access health centres where treatments can take place at most within days			2
likewise , any @entity1 true to its first principles of treatment free at the point of use will follow the lead of the last @entity250 and use the private sector to gain a better deal for us as patients and taxpayers			2
so , a revolutionised @entity1 outside day - to - day control of politicians and free to deliver the best treatment in the world for decades to come			2
unthinkable ? too radical even to contemplate ? tell that to the people who did the unthinkable and set up the @entity1 in 1948			2
@entity263 is mp for @entity264 .			0

the health service is facing potentially its worst financial crisis
by 2020 , on current plans , there will be a £ 30 billion shortfall in its budget
the causes are also well known as @entity275 has an ageing population
nothing short of a ' revolution ' is required to save the @entity1 from ruin
