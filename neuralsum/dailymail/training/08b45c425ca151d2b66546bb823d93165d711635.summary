@entity0 is where @entity1 will earn his money			1
@entity3 appointed @entity1 as his coach last december and how good a signing he has been remains to be seen			1
but i believe @entity1 was recruited with @entity0 in mind			1
@entity3 will not want to lose to @entity8 again , like he did in last year ’s final			1
he looked like a deer in the headlights at times during that match , as if he was bewildered by the ferocity of the crowd support for @entity8			1
surely he knew what it would be like ! i ’m not saying he would ’ve won it , but if @entity1 had been with him the night before you would ’ve certainly seen a different , more prepared @entity3 out there			1
but if anyone can help him at @entity0 , it ’s @entity1			1
when they walk through the gates together on monday , @entity1 ’s chest will be puffed out and his feathers fluffed			1
he won it three times , he was the king here and @entity3 will want some of @entity1 ’s magic to rub off on him			1
this is what he was brought to the party for and that ’s why i fancy @entity3 for the title , narrowly over @entity8 — i definitely think the winner will come from their semi-final			1
the big four are so closely matched and so good that they are constantly seeking out that microscopic edge			2
that ’s what @entity8 is looking for in @entity56			1
it is certainly an interesting appointment			2
i do n’t think she ’s been brought in to change tactics , more to have someone there to listen and know what to say and what advice to impart the night before a biggie			2
even the greats have doubts before semis or finals			2
i remember seeing that with my ex-wife @entity70			2
she had beaten her great rival @entity73 in three sets in a late night semi-final at @entity0 despite being a 20 - 1 underdog			1
she did all her off court media and we got back to our house in @entity80 and the phone was ringing off the hook			2
she was ecstatic and spoke to everyone			0
i said : ‘ great but in 24 hours you ’re on for the final			2
’ sure enough , the next morning she was completely flat			0
if @entity86 had been there she would have seen the signs and pulled her into line			0
as it was , @entity70 lost to @entity92			2
new approach : @entity8 has turned to @entity56 after parting with @entity94 patience : @entity56 will need time to help @entity8 improve his game one thing i detest on the women ’s tour is the shrieking during games			1
it ’s horrendous , absolutely awful and this was a product of people coaching it into them while they were young and now they ca n’t get out of it			0
you just do n’t need to make those noises when you ’re hitting the ball			0
it ’s off - putting for spectators , it ’s off - putting for the opponent and i ’m so glad the @entity116 are doing something about it			0
they ca n’t stop it for this generation but for the next it will be stopped			0
how they ’re going to do it will be interesting , maybe they ’ll have a gruntometer			0
but it has to be stopped			0
i ’ve heard some of them practising and they do n’t do it as loud then			0
after @entity94 , i do n’t think @entity8 could have been with anyone who was n’t a @entity30 winner			1
he has a lot of trust and respect for his best friend and hitting partner @entity135 but emotionally , @entity135 ca n’t tell him how he should feel the night before a @entity0 final , whereas @entity56 can			1
the only issue that could arise during rain delays is that women are not allowed in the men ’s locker rooms			0
they ’re both members at @entity0 so should be able to find a room but it could be a problem at the @entity146			2
i do n’t think it would be a problem if women were allowed in the locker room anyway			0
who gives a damn really ? there are female physios in football teams who are allowed in the changing rooms			0
i also hope @entity56 is given time			0
she ’s only been there three weeks and he ’s already failed to defend his @entity161 ’s title so in effect she ’s one down one to go			0
it can take a few months for a new coach to take effect so i hope she ’s not seen as a failure if @entity8 does n’t win @entity0			1
i listened to lay people questioning why he would appoint @entity56 and there are still those sexist attitudes			0
if it does n’t go well there ’ll be a lot of people saying : ‘ i told you so			0

@entity1 won three times at @entity0 in 1985 , 1986 and 1989
@entity3 lost in straight sets to @entity8 in last year *'s* final
