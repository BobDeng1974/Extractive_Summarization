the ‘ wild cat of @entity1 ' was feared to have struck again after the mutilated carcass of a second deer was found in a country field			1
the savaged animal was found a few miles from where the big cat is first believed to have struck in @entity8 near @entity9 , @entity10			1
it was found by a woman on tuesday as she walked her dog between @entity14 and @entity15 , near @entity16 – around 10 miles from the scene of the earlier attack			1
she went home to get a camera - but by the time she returned the deer had been stripped down to its spine , and all its vital organs were missing – a similar state to the first carcass			0
is this it ? this image of a large black animal was captured in a field in north - west @entity31 and could be the beast that is stalking a @entity10 village big cat expert @entity34 , who was first on the scene of the first killing , said he believed the same animal is behind both attacks			1
mr @entity34 , 65 , said : ‘ i have seen pictures of this carcass and it is hard to asses because there is not much left			0
‘ but it has all the hallmarks of a big cat kill			1
the woman found it in a field but when she came back to take photographs , it was completely stripped out , with just its spine left			0
‘ i believe it could be the same cat that attacked in @entity1 because , in my experience , these animals usually have a territory of around 100 square miles			1
‘ either that or it could be a relative or cub of this cat			2
’ the animal had been ripped open and was missing its heart , kidneys and liver , he said			0
its snout was also missing - important because big cats clamp their jaws over the mouth , causing death by suffocation			2
experts believe the deer was brought down and devoured by a large and powerful predator such as a puma , jaguar or leopard			0
@entity78 : a picture of the second deer 's body is shown on the laptop of big cat investigator @entity34			1
it was found by a female dogwalker @entity86 of the animal 's fur were also found piled by the body - and such predators neatly pluck the hair from the body before shearing their teeth into the flesh			0
tuesday ’s attack supports the theory of big cat hunters who are convinced a puma or panther is on the prowl			1
investigation : @entity34 is looking into both attacks , which he thinks were carried out by the same animal earlier this week a dog walker claimed to have seen a big cat in a field half a mile from where a deer had been found on january 4			1
that animal was found by dog walkers with its abdomen torn open and major organs including the heart , kidneys and liver missing			2
the woman , who did not want to be named , said : ‘ it was jet black and at least the size of a @entity118 , very powerfully built and with large paws , a long tail and a smallish head			1
’ a positive test result could provide more evidence of big cats living in the @entity126 countryside			2
mr @entity127 , an expert on big cats in @entity129 who examined the carcass of the six - month - old roe deer , said it showed ‘ hallmarks of a big cat attack ’ , adding : ‘ the claw and teeth impressions are indicative of big cat activity			1
‘ and the stomach was taken out and discarded			0
@entity140 cats are strict carnivores so they do n’t want to eat the grass - filled intestines			0
’ mr @entity34 added : ‘ big cats could be thriving at the moment because there are plenty of deer around and the winter weather creates more cover for them to hunt			2
‘ hopefully the dna test will prove what some of us have thought for years - that these creatures are roaming the countryside			0
’ @entity157 , 72 , said he had seen a big black cat nearby seven times in the past ten years , most recently in 2010			1
mr @entity157 said : ‘ it ’s not a normal feral cat , this is different and bigger			2
’ a large , panther - like animal has been pictured in fields just over the county border in north - west @entity31			0
examination : a man completes a dna test on the carcass of the deer			0
experts said that the attack had the hallmarks of a big cat due to claw and teeth impressions other recent sightings include a ‘ pure white predator ’ spotted in nearby @entity179 , just weeks before the deer was killed			1
@entity180 , who said he saw the beast , added : ‘ it was pure white			2
it almost looked like a polar bear			0
’ dr @entity185 , an expert in evolutionary genetics at @entity188 's @entity187 , is studying samples of dna taken from the first carcass			0
he said : " i 'm prepared to believe in the existence of big cats in the @entity126 and we have a reasonable chance of finding out if it was there			0
" we are in the process of studying samples of dna taken from the deer and if its death was the result of a big cat then we 're hoping it left cheek cells and saliva			1
the dna tests are expected to be completed later this month .			0
