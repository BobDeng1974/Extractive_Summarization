the fascinating surface of @entity2 's icy moon looms large in this newly - reprocessed image , which is exactly how @entity4 would appear to the human eye			1
the image , remastered from one captured by @entity7 in the late 1990s , shows the largest portion of the moon 's surface at the highest resolution ever seen			1
long cracks crisscross the surface , interrupted by dramatic ridges where the surface ice crust has been broken up and re-frozen into new patterns			0
the image , remastered from one captured by @entity7 in the late 1990s , shows the largest portion of the moon 's surface at the highest resolution ever seen			1
it has scale of one mile ( 1.6 km ) per pixel @entity22 on @entity23 is shown on the right , and the colours across the surface are associated with differences in geologic feature and location			1
for instance , areas that appear blue or white contain relatively pure water ice , while reddish and brown areas include non-ice components in higher concentrations			0
it is not yet known what these components are , although @entity39 has speculated that it may be a clay - like material			0
the polar regions , visible at the left and right of this view , are noticeably bluer than the more equatorial latitudes , due to differences in ice grain size			0
@entity7 images taken through near - infrared , green and violet filters have been combined to produce this view , which has a scale of one mile ( 1.6 km ) per pixel			1
@entity39 attempted to create a similar image in 2001 ( pictured )			0
this features colour profiles that had been increased to make contrast across the surface more obvious			0
the latest image , however , is more similar to what a human would see with the naked eye @entity2 's @entity23 is slightly smaller than @entity63 's moon			1
@entity4 orbits @entity2 every 3.5 days and is tidally locked - just like @entity64 - so that the same side of @entity23 faces @entity2 at all times			2
it is thought to have an iron core , a rocky mantle and a surface ocean of salty water , like @entity63			2
unlike on @entity63 , however , this ocean is deep enough to cover the whole surface of @entity4 , and being far from the sun , the ocean surface is globally frozen over			2
many experts believe the hidden ocean surrounding @entity4 , warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by @entity2 's gravity , may have conditions favourable for life			1
scientists claim that hidden beneath the icy surface of this incredible landscape is perhaps the most promising place in our solar system beyond @entity63 for life to exist			1
they are eager to learn if the reddish - brown fractures , and other markings spattered across the surface , contain clues about the geological history of @entity4 and the chemistry of the global ocean that is thought to exist beneath the ice			2
the @entity7 mission found strong evidence that a subsurface ocean of salty water is in contact with a rocky seafloor			0
scientists believe the cycling of material between the ocean and ice shell could potentially provide sources of chemical energy that could sustain simple life forms			0
it is believed that geysers spurting out of @entity2 ’s moon may be an opportunity to spot alien life originating beneath the surface			1
this was based on observations by the @entity116 in december 2013 that saw water vapour being ejected from the moon , lending evidence to the existence of jets			0
in september , @entity2 ’s @entity122 has been found to have tectonic activity like @entity63			2
this was the first time this specific type of geological activity has been observed in the solar system other than on our planet			1
the surface of @entity4 is slightly smaller than the @entity63 ’s moon			2
blocks on the surface are known to have shifted in the same way blocks on either side of the @entity137 move past each other on @entity63			0
earlier this year , scientists found evidence of plate tectonics on @entity142			0
this conceptual illustration of the subduction process - where one plate is forced under another - shows how a cold , brittle , outer portion of @entity4 's ice shell moved into the warmer shell interior this view an impact crater on @entity4 was created in 2013 using 3d stereo images taken by the @entity7 spacecraft , combined with advanced image processing techniques			1
the crater has a diameter of about 11 miles ( 18km			0
) young , well - preserved craters , like this @entity157 crater , are rare on @entity4 's surface , where ongoing geologic activity is thought to disrupt most surface features over timescales of tens of millions of years			1

the *stunning* image shows the largest portion of @entity2 's moon 's surface at the highest resolution ever seen
@entity22 on @entity23 is on the right , and colours across surface are associated with different geological features
it was created by combining image taken by @entity7 in the 1990s and has a scale of one mile ( 1.6 km ) per pixel
hidden beneath @entity23 's icy surface of is perhaps the most promising place in our solar system beyond @entity63
