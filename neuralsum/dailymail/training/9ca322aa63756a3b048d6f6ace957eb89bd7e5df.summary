by @entity1 reporter a woman is using social media to document her life with actor @entity5 - in the form of a cardboard cutout			1
@entity8 , 39 , decided that if she could n't spend her life with the @entity10 star , then she would ' just make one up '			1
she 's taken to @entity11 and has set up a website to share pictures of @entity5 doing chores and running errands with her including mowing the lawn , doing the dishes and shopping , all while dressed in a tasteful tux			1
good night @entity21 : the fact is , while most of us do n't actually live our lives with movie stars , many of us wish we did , writes @entity8 you think i 'd look good in this ? @entity8 actually met @entity5 during her sophomore year at @entity31 when they were in a play together pick that up would you @entity5 ? @entity34 said she started working on the project , which will also be a book , to show ' how our lives continued to have these weird parallels but are ultimately nothing alike ' the mum - of - two , from @entity41 , said she picked @entity5 because she actually went to college with @entity44 star			1
@entity8 said : ' i picked @entity5 because i went to college with him for one year and we were in a play together , so i 've watched his career from the get - go			1
' the fact is , while most of us do n't actually live our lives with movie stars , many of us wish we did			0
' and so , being a forward - thinking @entity52 , i have taken the bull by the horns , the horse by the reigns , the cardboard cutout of @entity5 by the shoulders , and just pretended that i do			1
' if i want a life with @entity5 , well , then ... i 'll just make one up			1
' running the red carpet : she said the pictures are ' a way for me to poke fun at how i ended up where i am and how / why my one - time stage equal has gone on to become an @entity68 nominee ' pushing it : on her site , @entity34 gives a shout out to her family , including @entity74 , ' possibly the most patient husband in the world and relatively uninterested participant in these photos ' @entity34 , who counts @entity79 and @entity80 among her favorites of the actor 's films , said she 's never heard from @entity5 or anyone in his camp she 's even got her kids and husband @entity74 in on the action - although her daughter keeps confusing @entity5 with @entity91			1
' my husband is totally supportive and thinks it 's funny			0
weirdly , some of his friends ask him if he 's ok with it , as if i 'm hanging out around town with a real life @entity5 instead of a cardboard version			1
' my kids think it 's fun but get a little impatient with it sometimes , especially if they think i 'm not doing something they want me to do			0
then they 're like ' it 's @entity5 this and @entity5 that ! ' ' my daughter is young enough to not realize it might be embarrassing - i even took him to her school			2
my son would be mortified if i did that to him ! ' tucking him in : @entity113 says that she and @entity5 have some ' mutual friends , friends of friends , ' so she 's sure he 'll eventually hear about her project good father : her daughter keeps referring to @entity5 as @entity91 but she is in on the fun who am i to buck the system ? if i want a life with @entity5 , well , then ¿ i ¿ ll just make one up ' , @entity8 says she added : ' when i first unfold him , people are definitely looking at me like i 'm crazy			2
i 'm so grateful my friend , @entity124 , the photographer , comes with me everywhere so i do n't look like the only crazy person			0
' anyway , most people end up asking what we 're doing and then they love it and it 's totally comfortable			0
the weirdest is when people do n't say anything and just avert their eyes - how can you not ask ? ' @entity8 is currently working on a book about her unusual project and added that @entity5 has in ' no way endorsed , sponsored or participated in this ridiculousness			2
' a disclaimer on @entity8 's website states : ' @entity5 was not harmed in the taking of these photos			2
' but what would she say to the man himself ? ' what would i say to @entity5 ? um.			2
. hi ? ' dressed to impress : @entity8 has been posting photos of her family and @entity5 since april all the fun of the fair with you : @entity8 insists that no @entity156 were harmed in the taking of the photos			0
also , he doesn ¿ t know about the account @entity8 writes , ' fortunately , @entity161 is a total gentleman			0
unfortunately , i 'm still roasting			0
and things are only going to get worse without air conditioning in the @entity164 ' ' who would have thought that @entity5 could be so silly ? sure enough , it was his idea to take these pics the other day while we were strolling @entity170 in @entity41			0
he is hysterical ! ' says @entity8			0

@entity172 , 39 , has pictures of herself with the star in all manner of poses
she went to college with the actor and is enjoying the break from reality
@entity5 is forced to *smile* his way through menial household chores and hold a pose in *countless* pictures
