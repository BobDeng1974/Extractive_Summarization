prince @entity2 's decision to quit flying military attack helicopters to take an @entity5 desk job in @entity6 was spurred by a desire to spend more time with girlfriend @entity9 , a friend has said			1
the 29 - year - old , who co-piloted @entity12 gunships on the @entity14 front line , is to begin a new role helping to co-ordinate ‘ significant projects and commemorative events ’ for the @entity5 in @entity6			1
captain @entity18 , as he is known in the @entity5 , will also lead a bid to bring the @entity20 , an ‘ @entity21 ’ for wounded service personnel , to the @entity23			2
it must be love : prince @entity2 , left , has quit his job as an @entity12 helicopter pilot to take a desk job helping to co-ordinate ' significant projects ' - as well as to spend more time with girlfriend @entity9 , right and the move means that he can further develop his 18 - month relationship with 24 - year - old @entity33 , a dancer - although friends insist an engagement is not imminent			1
a friend of the couple told @entity38 : ' the distance made it difficult for @entity2 to see @entity41 as often as he would have liked			2
moving to @entity6 full time will no doubt make them even closer			2
' it shows he is serious and @entity41 is thrilled			0
' but the fourth in line to the throne risks criticism for ditching the @entity50 after defence chiefs spent £ 2.5million training him to fly the helicopters			0
despite his undoubted aptitude as a pilot – the prince was one of the two best young airmen on his course – his decision raises questions that his place could have been given to a soldier intending to spend their whole career with the elite unit			2
@entity2 , who remains a commissioned officer in the @entity68 , will take up the staff officer role in @entity70 , based at @entity71			2
the move will allow him to take on more royal duties on behalf of his 87 - year - old grandmother , the @entity74			1
but sources said his desire to expand the @entity20 into a global contest was ‘ very much tied up ’ with his decision to quit the @entity50			0
the prince attended the event near @entity103 , @entity104 , last year , and was ‘ blown away ’ by the inspirational tournament in which more than 300 injured troops competed			0
a senior insider said : ‘ prince @entity2 is passionate about this project			1
he believes it will be an amazing event that will bring the focus of attention on the problems facing those injured on the frontline			0
’ last year @entity2 said : ‘ i do n’t see how it would n’t be possible to fill a stadium with 80,000 people , not to watch @entity21 , not to watch @entity118 , but to watch wounded servicemen fight it out amongst each other – not on a battlefield but in a stadium			2
' it is understood plans to bring the @entity20 to @entity6 next year are ‘ 90 per cent in the bag ’ and that @entity2 will play a central role in organising them			1
the young royal began the 18 - month @entity12 training course in july 2010 , qualifying as a co-pilot gunner in february 2012			0
officers were so impressed with his aptitude for flying the £ 46million helicopter that he was handed the prize of top co-pilot gunner on his course			0
@entity2 flew to @entity79 last year to support competitors taking part in the @entity20 , a paralympic style event for injured servicemen and women , and he hopes to help bring the event to the @entity23 prince @entity2 gives a high five to @entity145 as he meets @entity23 soldiers competing in the @entity20 and plays sitting volleyball with them in @entity78 in may last year the prince was an @entity149 commander and co-pilot gunner and flew missions in @entity153 during his last deployment to @entity14 completed in january last year one of two crew in an @entity12 , the co-pilot gunner commands the mission , fires the weapons , navigates and sometimes takes over the controls			1
the prince ’s first tour of duty – a secret deployment with the @entity68 – was cut short in 2008 when news of his presence was leaked on foreign websites and he was brought back to @entity23			0
prince @entity2 , pictured during a visit to the @entity167 at the @entity168 , @entity169 , became a fully operational @entity170 in february 2012 however , @entity2 was so determined to do another tour of duty that he retrained as an @entity12 pilot to increase his chances of being redeployed			1
in september 2012 he returned to @entity14 to fly the attack helicopters in the battle against the @entity176			0
he served a four - month deployment at @entity178 and later admitted he had killed an insurgent in a missile strike			0
asked yesterday about the royal ’s sudden change of job , a senior source said : ‘ prince @entity2 wants a career in the military and it is not unusual for an officer to change his career path after this length of time			1
’ lieutenant colonel @entity192 , who commanded prince @entity2 in the @entity50 , said the prince had ‘ reached the pinnacle of flying excellence as an @entity12 pilot ’ and had been a ‘ real inspiration ’ to his colleagues			1
a senior @entity5 source said that @entity2 had not prevented anyone else from flying @entity201 , adding : ‘ there are not queues and queues of people able to do it , and @entity2 got there on merit			0
’ lieutenant colonel @entity209 , who commanded @entity23 troops in @entity14 , said : ‘ this is normal procedure for all officers … it is necessary to have people with operational experience making decisions in headquarters which is one of the reasons why this happens			0
‘ it is likely that an officer like prince @entity2 will return to a front line position after completing his staff role			1

move will allow him to take on more royal duties on behalf of the queen
he will also be able to spend more time with girlfriend @entity9
will allow him to devote time to bringing @entity20 to @entity6
