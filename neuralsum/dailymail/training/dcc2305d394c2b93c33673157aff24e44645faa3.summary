visibly shaken mr @entity2 , whose body is covered in bruises and cuts , said : ‘ i just lived to get through each day			2
i did n’t understand why it was happening or if it would end			2
‘ i pleaded with the guards to either kill me or release me			2
i tried not to think about anything apart from surviving			2
’ privately educated mr @entity2 , of @entity3 , @entity4 , arrived in the city of @entity42 , in eastern @entity6 , in november to study to be a surgeon			1
the area was then under the control of the @entity6 government and was a safe place to be			1
however , in april this year it fell into the hands of separatists and mr @entity2 had started to make plans to leave			2
but due to the bureaucratic mess created in the wake of the uprising , it had taken longer than expected to sort out the paperwork for him to be able to safely leave @entity42			1
three weeks ago , the young student was accosted on his way to a shop for not being able to speak @entity60 and accused of being a spy			2

he said : ‘ i ’d popped out to buy some cigarettes and a drunk @entity60 man started shouting at me			1
i understand a bit of the language and he was getting really aggressive because i was speaking in @entity84			2
‘ then he hit me , so i hit him back and someone called the self - proclaimed police force who are the rebels			1
there was about four of them			2
they started to hit me and started firing bullets around the street			1

his parents , property developer @entity150 , 53 , and medical interpreter @entity151 , 42 , who have three other children , refused to believe their son was dead and kept up the pressure on the @entity155 and hit back at the claims made by rebels online and in the @entity60 media			1
