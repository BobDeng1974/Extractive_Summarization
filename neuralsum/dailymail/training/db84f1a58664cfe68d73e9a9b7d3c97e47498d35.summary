by @entity0 ever wondered the secret to making perfect ice cream ? well wonder no more , because the science of the sweet has been revealed in a video that explains the methods to get different results			1
from hard and ‘ crunchy ’ to a softer treat , @entity8 channel reactions takes a look at how the consistency of ice cream depends on the rate at which it is cooled			1
this is because a rapid freezing process makes smaller crystals , leading to a creamier treat in the video , it is explained how the crystals in ice cream determine the consistency			2
a gene linked to obesity , which makes ice cream and sugary foods tastier for girls , was discovered by scientists last year			2
researchers claim the discovery of the gene means it might not be our fault if we make poor food choices - and could partly help explain obesity			0
contrary to ' blaming ' obese people for making poor food choices , the @entity49 researchers say that obesity is caused by genetic predisposition , environmental stress and emotional wellbeing			0
they discovered a gene variant - or allele - which regulates the production of the pleasure hormone , dopamine			0
the findings , published in the journal @entity63 , could be an important step towards prevention and treatment of the condition , they claim			0
professor @entity68 of @entity69 , @entity70 , said : ' in broad terms , we are finding that obesity is a product of genetics , early development and circumstance			0
' ‘ what you ’re doing when you make creamy ice cream is you control the size of ice crystals in your ice cream , ’ says dr @entity78 from the @entity79 in the video			1
he explains that ice crystals start off as a ‘ hexagonal shape ’			0
when more ice is added the crystals grow , and the bigger they get , the crunchier the final ice cream becomes			2
for a creamier treat , the crystals need to be small			0
there are two ways to do that , the first being to use an emulsifier			0
this keeps the water molecules and fats mixed together , preventing the water freezing in clumps and allowing for smaller ice crystals			0
the second way is to change the rate at which the water freezes ; the faster it cools , the smaller the crystals and the smoother the ice cream			1
in the video dr @entity78 from the @entity79 in @entity110 shows how three different methods can produce ice cream with different textures			1
the smoothest ice cream is created when liquid nitrogen ( pictured ) is used to rapidly cool the treat , while the crunchiest stems from using salt and ice in a bag to test this , dr @entity78 makes ice cream in three ways : using an ice cream maker , then salt and ice in a bag and finally using liquid nitrogen			1
the salt and ice method produces the ‘ crunchiest ’ ice cream as it takes the longest to cool			2
next up is the ice cream maker , which takes about 30 minutes , while the much faster liquid nitrogen produces the smoothest results			1
dr @entity78 also explains that mixing the ice cream ensures air spreads through it , helping with flavour and stability			1
and it ’s also noted how the cold temperature numbs the taste buds on the tongue , meaning lots of sugar and fat is needed in ice cream , which is why melted ice cream tastes sweeter			0
but , the video concludes , ' we ’re not saying you have to buy liquid nitrogen and start blasting your ice cream with it , but at least you now know why your ice cream treat is so silky smooth			1

dr @entity78 from @entity110 explains how to make ice cream
the @entity79 professor was talking in a video for reactions
he explains how the faster ice cream is cooled , the smoother it becomes
using three different methods he then shows how the science works
and the method to get the smoothest ice cream was to use liquid nitrogen
