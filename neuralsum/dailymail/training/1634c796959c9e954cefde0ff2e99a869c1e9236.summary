the @entity0 believe their legal action stopped @entity2 being given security over @entity4 this week – but they still harbour fears for the future			1
the fan - ownership group went to court on monday seeking an interim interdict to prevent the @entity4 board from including the stadium in a deal with @entity2 ’s @entity13 firm			1
talks with club laywers then produced an agreement that ensures security over @entity4 can not be granted until february 17			1
the @entity0 believe they stopped @entity2 being given security over @entity4 rangers have been troubled by off - field financial difficulties that have led to the club 's plight advance notices of security submitted to the registry of @entity26 on behalf of @entity13 a fortnight ago had suggested such a move was in the pipeline and prompted protests from supporters			1
but the terms of the £ 10 million loan – comprised of two £ 5 million tranches - announced on tuesday instead included security over @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 car park and club trademarks			2
the @entity0 believe they only have a partial victory as they remain concerned about the gap between their agreement expiring and the forthcoming @entity43 , at which @entity44 will seek to oust the current board			2
a date for that meeting is yet to be announced and could , under normal protocol , be at the end of next month			0
‘ following detailed legal advice , the @entity0 ( @entity0 ) , with the financial backing of the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) , submitted a petition to the @entity55 in @entity56 on monday 26th january , seeking an interim interdict to stop the @entity19 board from granting security over @entity4 in favour of @entity13 , ’ said an @entity0 statement			1
‘ discussions between our lawyers and the board ’s lawyers continued over the past three days			0
the conclusion of these discussions was the that board has agreed not to grant security over @entity4 for a period up until the 17th february covered by the advance notice they submitted			1
the @entity0 are still concerned about the future of the football club ‘ we are disappointed that we were not able to secure the extension of this commitment until the date of the upcoming @entity43 , as this now leaves a short period of time in which the board could grant security over @entity4 before they are hopefully removed			1
‘ this is particularly concerning given the announcement yesterday that a further period of due diligence is required for the second £ 5m tranche of debt that the board has decided to saddle the club with			0
‘ we believe our actions had a material impact in stopping the board from granting security over @entity4			2
the revised deal with @entity13 was agreed late on monday night according to @entity92 , the club ’s @entity94 nomad			0
' this was immediately following the petition submitted to the court , the announcement of which delayed what would have been a necessary interdict hearing in the @entity55 on tuesday			0
‘ we do not believe that the filing of a notice of intention to grant security over @entity4 was an error and we believe that a fixed security over @entity4 would most likely have been granted to @entity13 had it not been challenged			1
we would like to register our disappointment that it was necessary to take legal action to hold this board to their public promises to shareholders and fans			0
‘ whilst we are pleased that the immediate danger posed to @entity4 has been averted , we share the anger of other fans at the latest act of corporate piracy perpetrated by the current @entity19 directors			2
@entity44 will seek to oust the current board at the next agm ' by accepting this deal with @entity13 , they have plunged our club into an unnecessary level of debt and , by pawning off further revenue streams including shirt sponsorship , have limited our ability to repay that debt			0
‘ they have done this in their own interests and those of @entity2			0
@entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 have , in our opinion , neglected their duties to the plc they are meant to represent			0

@entity0 believe they stopped @entity2 getting security over @entity4
but they are still concerned about the future of their club
security over @entity4 could be granted after february 17
