by @entity0 published : 11:58 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 18:55 est , 4 december 2013 a campaigner is shining a light on the emotional , physical and sexual abuse young girls experience at the hands of their peers and campaigning for change			2
children as young as 11 are being groomed , bullied , beaten and raped by boys not much older than themselves and @entity10 , 29 , from north @entity11 says government policy does not protect them			1
' we have a child protection system that is designed to look at risk in the home and assess a child there , ' she argues			2
' but in the files i ’ve looked at , the primary risk - in terms of sexual abuse , physical assault and risk of offending - comes from their peer group			1
' @entity10 witnessed effects of gang violence first - hand when six murders occurred in her home town victims of child - on - child sexual abuse tend to be between 11 and 13 when it starts , perpetrators between 13 and 15 , @entity32 outlines to the @entity36			1
she explains how young girls are victim to extreme sexual bullying upon joining secondary school and made to feel that in order to fit in , they must comply with the culture			2
but why boys are motivated to rape their peers is ' quite complicated ' - especially when they operate as a group			1
for her research , the @entity45 and the @entity46 have given @entity48 to their files on violent cases among the young			2
she also talks to victims first hand			2
' when someone trusts you with their story , you honour that trust , ' says @entity10 , who has worked with female victims attached to gangs since 2005			1
the most harrowing tale she can recall comes from a 20 - year - old whom she met in a refuge			2
the young woman , who can no longer have children due to her injuries , had two relationships with gang members as a teenager			0
they broke her legs and collar bone , beat and cut her with knives			0
they both raped and filmed her in front of their friends , and she was even ' sold ' to clear a drugs debt			0
the young woman thought her gang association would mean she would n't be taken seriously			0
young girls are made to feel in order to fit in , they must comply ' she thought she 'd brought it on herself because she gained something from the relationships : her ex was giving her coke ... she could n't acknowledge she was a " worthy " victim , ' says @entity10			1
this young woman contributed her story to @entity10 's nationwide research project , where she interviewed around 800 men and women from 2005 to 2008			1
her report eventually earned £ 1.2 million of government funding towards services that protect and work with young people at risk of gang - related and sexual violence			1
there are now 13 new posts around the country , largely thanks to @entity10 's work			1
to earn the trust of her interviewees , @entity10 would need to make repeat visits to refuges , prisons and schools and give talks			1
she was initially interviewing people on the impact of gangs , and sexual violence seemed to be the hidden piece of the jigsaw			0
when she put out a call for focus groups on young people and weapons , she was shocked when half the attendees were women			0
she work tirelessly and listens to the most horrific stories , but says progress keeps her going ' they told us about being coerced to carry guns and knives , sexual violence and exploitation , ' says @entity10			1
' one girl told us , " they stop and search young men , but you ca n't stop and search for rape "			2
' passionate for change , @entity10 has achieved a staggering amount in her eight years , propelling issues surrounding young women , weapons and gang violence firmly onto the government 's agenda and working on projects ensuring they are safer and their voices are being heard and taken seriously			1
she witnessed the effects of gang violence first - hand in 2005 when six murders occurred in just seven months in her home town			2
it was this that inspired her to attempt to make changes on a national level			0
' people in government making the decisions had no idea what it was like to live in an area like that , but i did , ' @entity10 says			1
she work tirelessly and listens to the most horrific stories , but says progress keeps her going ' before my research there was nothing in government policy to deal with gang violence with women			0
' but upon uncovering the full impact of violence on young women , she was sent to a @entity172 conference to present her findings and later awarded an mbe			0
' there are funds for violence against women , but not for this particular group ... a 15 - year - old girl who needs protection from 20 young men is in a very different situation			1
there were lots of issues not being addressed , ' she says			0
' we quickly had a significant impact			0
' she launched the @entity189 on august to address gender inequality among the young , and last week advised the @entity191 after launching the highly - publicised national inquiry into sexual exploitation of girls by gangs			2
' at the moment it 's just me working with an intern and an advisory panel who assist			0
we want to secure more funding and hire three young women in the @entity204 , ' she says			0
her next task is writing a phd tackling child peer - on - peer abuse at @entity209			1
' i 'm lucky that we 've seen significant changes in government policy			0
securing change is what spurs me on , but so much more work needs doing ... ' there 's only so much @entity216 can do			0
we need to not be needed , and for the work to be delivered without me there			0
i want a national strategy to tackle the issue			0
' @entity10 has been shortlisted for the women 's warrior category @entity223 2013 with @entity224			1
