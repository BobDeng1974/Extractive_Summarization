@entity0 has already secured the race to @entity3 crown but the world no 1 is still putting in the leg work ahead of teeing it up at the season - finale @entity7			1
@entity0 is about to bring the curtain down on his best ever campaign after winning @entity11 , the @entity12 , the @entity13 and the @entity14			2
there was also @entity17 triumph at @entity18 in september as @entity20 's @entity19 beat @entity22 's troops from the @entity23			0
@entity0 posted this picture to his @entity26 account after enjoying a leg workout in @entity3 @entity0 was working up a sweat with the big weights in his preparation for the @entity7 @entity0 , who is paired with @entity31 on thursday at @entity32 , has been warming up with some heavy work in the gym and posting pictures on @entity26			1
he tweeted : ' great leg workout to start the day			0
' @entity0 was out for a practice round on tuesday ahead of the season - ending @entity7 meanwhile , @entity0 believes @entity38 deserves to win this year 's @entity39 after criticising the sport 's controversial double - points system			1
whilst @entity0 competes in the final event of the @entity43 , 60 miles away along the @entity44 goes head - to - head with @entity47 team - mate @entity46 for @entity49 's glittering prize at the @entity50 in @entity51			1
the fact @entity0 has already secured a second ' race to @entity3 ' title without striking a ball in anger in this week 's event has prompted debate the format of the @entity60 requires tweaking to ensure a grandstand finale			1
@entity38 posing in front of his private jet ahead of the @entity39 season finale in @entity51 @entity0 , speaking in @entity3 on tuesday , insists @entity38 is more deserving of the title than @entity46 in order to guarantee an end - of - year showdown in @entity49 it is why double points were introduced this season , yet with 17 between @entity44 and @entity46 , ironically such a gimmick is not required on this occasion			1
whilst @entity0 is unconcerned whether golf 's rulers change the @entity60 format , he does at least feel @entity49 has taken a step too far			1
' i do n't think their whole season should be decided on one race with the double points , ' said the 25 - year - old			2
' it makes it exciting for the fans , but i 'm sure @entity38 does n't think it 's that exciting right now			0
@entity38 and @entity46 will battle it out for the drivers ' championship at the final race of the season on sunday @entity38 , pictured after winning the @entity93 @entity92 in july , is bidding to win his second world title ' hopefully for him it all works out and he does come out on top because he 's definitely the deserving champion of this year			1
' what double points in @entity49 has done is afford @entity46 a far greater opportunity to take the championship			2
victory for @entity46 , with @entity44 third or worse , will see him claim a crown won by father @entity104 in 1982			2
if the current system had continued into the closing race , @entity38 could have finished at worst sixth behind a @entity46 win and still emerge as champion			1
given the furore behind the scheme since it was first aired almost a year ago , it is certain to be dropped when it comes up for debate at the next @entity117 meeting in early december			0
@entity47 motorsport boss @entity118 , far from a fan with his drivers at the heart of the topic , said : ' my personal view is we have had a big backlash from the fans and many vocal personalities who do n't like the system			0
' many within the group of stakeholders of @entity39 also do n't like the concept			0
' i have been a racing driver myself			0
if i put myself in the situation i would n't want to have double points			0
' probably the decision taken together was n't the right one , and we need to change it for the future			0
' it is down to the commercial rights holder and the governing body , and i hope we are going to make the right decisions			0
