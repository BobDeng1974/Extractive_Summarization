by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:49 est , 6 july 2012 updated : 15:28 est , 6 july 2012 they 're highly - trained @entity3 pilots who risk life and limb to rescue people trapped in dangerous and life - threatening situations			2
so it was perhaps a bit of a surprise for @entity12 ’s @entity11 when they were called to free a man trapped bottom up in a bramble bush			0
@entity17 got himself into the prickly situation when a model aircraft he was flying , near the @entity21 beauty spot at @entity22 , @entity23 , crash - landed			1
@entity21 , viewed from @entity22 , @entity23 , where @entity17 got himself into a prickle when trying to retrieve his model aircraft the 42 - year - old waded into the thick , thorny undergrowth to retrieve the plane , but he got so tangled in the brambles that he could n’t get out again			1
the local coastguard and a search and rescue helicopter from @entity12 ’s @entity11 were scrambled to the scene			2
the chopper hovered over the bushes and crews managed to cut down the brambles and winch him to safety			0
however , some members of the public have criticised the rescue saying it was a waste of public money to send out a helicopter for someone stuck in a bush			1
a coastguard spokesman said : ' he was n’t badly injured but he ’d been stuck fast in the brambles and it seemed the simplest way to get him out			2
it was certainly one of our more unusual rescues			0
' construction worker mr @entity17 , of @entity52 , @entity23 , said he was stuck in the bush for an hour , unable to crawl out			1
@entity17 struggled for an hour after falling 15ft into chest deep in brambles			1
he said he was covered in cuts and it was a distressing , horrible experience he said : ' a group of six of us were flying model aircraft on @entity21 and unfortunately mine lost signal with the remote control and got stuck in a bush			1
' the plane is worth £ 200 and contains a battery which can catch fire so i decided to try and retrieve it			0
' he started his hunt in a patch of soft bracken while being guided by a friend looking down from a slope above him			0
however , mr @entity17 could not see a 15ft drop in front of him and tumbled down the bank into the two - metre deep bramble patch			1
he said : ' i was completely stuck upside down and covered in cuts			1
my clothes were ripped to pieces			2
the more i struggled , the worse it got			0
' i felt helpless , distressed , disorientated and dehydrated			0
it was a horrible experience			0
' mr @entity17 has hit back at critics who said it was a waste of public money to mount such a large rescue operation for someone who 'd toppled into a thorn bush			1
he said the experience was ' extremely frightening ' he added : ' they could n’t see me at first because i was so deeply buried			1
when they did find me they attached a harness , told me to curl up into a ball and literally ripped me out of the brambles			2
' what made the whole thing even more embarrassing was that i knew almost all of the rescue crew as i fly model airplanes at @entity12 most weeks			0
' mr @entity17 has been in for stick through online forums from people who claimed it had been ' stupid and a waste of public money ' to mount such a large rescue operation for someone who ’d toppled into a thorn bush			1
but mr @entity17 has hit back , saying : ' the experience was extremely frightening and i found people ’s comments afterwards very offensive			1
' this is exactly what the emergency services are here to do - deal with emergencies			0
unless you were there you really ca n’t appreciate it , ' he said			0
' the helicopter crew were so concerned about the potentially flammable battery that they went back to recover it after they had rescued me			2
this was not a trivial situation and i have found some of the comments against me very offensive			0
