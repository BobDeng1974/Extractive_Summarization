a 17 - stone pot - bellied pig scared off a gang of burglars who attempted to raid a family 's home on @entity5			1
ludwig the pig faced the raiders inside @entity8 and his partner @entity9 's home in @entity11			1
the couple , who lived in the house for two months before the raid have now pledged never to eat pork again because of the bravery of their pig			1
ludwig the pot - bellied pig , left , managed to scare off burglars from his owners ' home in @entity11 @entity25 's owners @entity8 , rear and @entity9 , right , were asleep when raiders attacked their home the couple , who are originally from @entity30 believe that @entity25 , pictured , chased the burglars away mr @entity8 said : ' the noise he makes is like a low rumble that sounds like the biggest rottweiler you can imagine so i think they just ran			1
' it was @entity5 and when we came down in the morning , the door was wide open			1
' the room was still warm so they ca n’t have been there for that long			2
' they must have woken @entity25 up and when he realised that we were n’t up and would have been disturbed he sprang into action			1
' there were things in there they could have taken , like a bike , but they just left			2
' the couple , from @entity30 , adopted @entity25 after he was handed into an animal rescue centre in their native country			1
however , when they moved to @entity55 , @entity25 was almost prevented from coming as local authorities did not have the correct paperwork to export a pet pig			1
mr @entity8 , right , said the raiders were probably scared off by @entity25 's incredibly low growl ms @entity9 said : ' he is actually the first pot - bellied pig to be exported from @entity30 as a pet			1
' the options on the form were fattening , which is a no - no as he is fat enough as it is , slaughter is clearly not going to happen and breeding , which he ca n’t do because he is fixed			2
' so after many phone calls , the @entity30 government actually added an extra box to the form that says pet ! ' we are the people that buy pets for our pets			1
' at the time , we had a little cockatiel who would fly around the house but she was afraid of other birds			1
' i did n’t want to get a dog or a cat			2
i tried to get @entity8 interested in lots of different exotic animals and we settled on a pig			1
' i spent two years doing research			2
pigs are a nice pet because they are very intelligent but there is a trade - off			2
' a pig is like a two or three - year - old toddler but he is a toddler who will never grow up and they live to around 20			2
' when we first got him back and he was only a couple of months old , we put a litter tray down for him			2
but he got confused and had an accident on the kitchen floor			0
' but i showed him where it was and then four hours later he went to his litter box and we have never had an accident since			0
' ms @entity9 , right , said there are many misconceptions about the cleanliness of having a pet pig keeping @entity25 clean often only involves brushing him , or on occasion using dog shampoo the couple said that much of the time @entity25 was too lazy to cause any damage to their home ms @entity9 said there were many misconceptions concerning having a pig for a pet			1
she said : ' pigs like to be clean			0
he does n’t have much of a coat so when he gets dirty you just give him a brush down with a broom			0
' or if he is particularly unclean , or needs to be extra fancy , then he might have some dry dog shampoo			0
' he goes to the toilet in the back yard like a dog would and we just clean up after him			0
' originally the couple moved from @entity30 and wanted to settle in @entity135 but they faced significant problems over their house guest			1
she revealed : ' i moved over a couple of months before and was actually living in @entity135 but none of the landlords would allow me to have a pig ! ' as a house animal , he is well behaved and is n’t a destructive animal but i could see the potential for it			1
it ’s the same with a dog			0
they get destructive because they are bored			0
' ms @entity9 , left , believes that she is able to communicate with @entity25 , right , using sign language the couple imported the unusual pet with them when they moved to the @entity55 from @entity30 according to ms @entity9 , @entity25 , pictured , can be quite an emotional animal even though he is tough ms @entity9 said it was important that they trained @entity25 and she believes that she is now even able to communicate with the 17 - stone animal ' so we make him little treat boxes that he has to figure out and he has toddler toys and dog toys			1
“ he never wrecks the yards , though , because he is just too lazy			0
when you tell him to do something , he wants to know what the outcome will be			0
' so he wo n’t just do things on command but he knows the words for things and i have started using sign language with him now as well , which seems to be working			0
' he is also a very emotional animal , as tough as he is physically , if he is really naughty i will shame him and send him outside			0
then he cries and he actually sheds tears			0
' our bond is incredible - he only gets up when we get up			0
until then he stays pretty quiet			0
' the noises he makes are quite a nice low - decibel level generally , unless you are trying to make him do something he does n’t want to , then it just sounds like he is being slaughtered ! '			0
