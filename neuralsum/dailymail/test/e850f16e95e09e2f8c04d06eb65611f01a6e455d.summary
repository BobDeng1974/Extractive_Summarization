this is the shocking dashcam footage which shows a @entity2 's mechanic taking a customer 's car for a joyride at almost double the speed limit when he took it in for an @entity7			1
@entity8 booked his @entity9 in for a major service and @entity7 at @entity11 in @entity12 last month , costing £ 255			1
but when he went to collect his car , he was shocked to discover that a mechanic had taken it for a spin after his dashcam recorded footage of it being driven at 57mph in a 30 mph zone			1
he explained : ' when i saw the footage i was left open - mouthed			2
the mechanic was abusing my car and my trust			1
' as a nationwide company i thought i had nothing to worry about			0
but i feel very let down			0
' from now on i will always wait by the car whilst it is being serviced			1
' mr @entity8 , who is a married father - of three and works as a large goods vehicle assessor for @entity46 , said that the dashboard camera was not switched but was on standby mode on a motion sensor			1
he said : ' i was not trying to catch anybody out			0
i bought the camera - ironically - from a @entity11 store in @entity12 last year			1
the dashcam captured seven hours worth of footage after mr @entity8 left his car at the @entity12 branch of @entity57 footage showing the car being taken out on a test drive captured by the dashcam			1
it also showed included the mechanic swearing and boasting about test - driving the car ' i have it in for road safety purposes because of the way some people drive			1
' i did not look at the footage on the friday afternoon when i picked the car up			2
' i saw it the next day and i almost choked on my pasty			0
the biggest file on there was the road test where the mechanic was doing nearly twice the speed limit			1
' i then decided to look at all the footage			0
there was one clip of him reversing the car off the @entity7 bay and leaning over to tell a colleague ‘ you wait til i road test this later			1
’ ' that shows that it was something that was pre-planned and not a spur of the moment thing when he was driving my car			1
mr @entity8 says the dashcam had been switched to standby mode and came on due to its motion sensor ' there is another clip of him constantly swearing when he ca n’t find the key sensor			1
' i have not been given his name and i do n’t need to know unless i get a speeding ticket			0
' there is no point getting really angry about it			0
but it is fair to say i was open - mouthed when i saw the footage			0
' i took the laptop in on the monday morning and the manager was very non-plussed when i showed him the footage			0
' had he apologised then i would have left it			0
but i have now spoken with the head office and the regional manager and still not received an apology			0
at least they have started to take it more seriously though			0
' i look after my car - it is my biggest asset and cost me nearly £ 10,000 and it is disgusting that someone like him treats it like this			2
' i would never have known about it if i did not have the camera			0
i did not know it would pick it up but it has proved to be well worth the money			0
' @entity57 have explained that the mechanic who drove the car was a temporary employee at the branch in @entity12 , who has since been removed from this role			1
the company described his behaviour as “ appalling ” and offered to refund the cost for the @entity7 and service			0
the regional manager for @entity139 , @entity140 , also told mr @entity140 in an email that the mechanic ’s behaviour was unacceptable			2
he said : ' he drove your car in what i can only describe as an appalling manner			2
' i do not and will never condone that level of pure neglect which is why the mechanic in question has been removed from working within the @entity152			2
' meanwhile a spokesperson for @entity11 head office said : ' we were really disappointed to find out that this had happened and that we have let the customer down			0
' we are treating this isolated incident as a priority and can confirm that the mechanic no longer works at @entity57			1
' please rest assured that we take issues like this very seriously ensuring that our 300 @entity139 always adhere to all road test procedures			2
