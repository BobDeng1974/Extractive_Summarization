' i accept you are somebody who has had a difficult upbringing and you have had to live in the glare of publicity with a father , that according to the testimonials , was hardly the proper role model to a son			2
' but that is also no excuse to target mr @entity18 as you did			0
i view this so serious only immediate custody is appropriate			0
