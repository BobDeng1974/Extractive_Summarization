the word ' lunatic ' itself was derived from the @entity4 word for moon ' luna , ' as many were convinced that the celestial body could cause disease and strange behaviour			0
and it 's a theory that persists today , with many people believing that a full moon is more likely to coincide with hectic periods in hospitals or in birth wards			1
but dr @entity16 , a professor of planetary astronomy at the @entity18 , has carried out a study that proves that the concept is essentially rubbish			1
a researcher from the @entity18 says that claims the moon causes illnesses are rubbish			2
dr @entity16 said that when life is hectic on the day of a full moon , many people remember the association because it confirms their belief - but they do not remember when nothing in particular happens on such a day his research was carried out to illustrate how intelligent and otherwise reasonable people develop strong beliefs that are not aligned with reality			1
' the absence of a lunar influence on human affairs has been demonstrated in the areas of automobile accidents , hospital admissions , surgery outcomes , cancer survival rates , menstruation , births , birth complications , depression , violent behaviour , and even criminal activity ' , dr @entity16 writes			1
even though a 40 - year - old @entity54 study demonstrated that the timing of births does not correlate in any way with the lunar cycle , the belief in a lunar effect has persisted			2
a full moon is when it is on the opposite side of @entity62 from the sun. this means its entire surface is lit up by the sun , making it especially bright			0
a new moon is when it is in the same direction as the sun , so its ' far side ' is lit , and it can barely be seen in @entity62 's sky			0
on average , the moon is 239,000 miles ( 384,000km ) from @entity62 and takes 27 days , seven hours , 43 minutes and 11.6 seconds to complete one orbit			0
a 2004 study in a nursing journal , for example , suggested that the full moon influenced the number of hospital admissions in a medical unit in @entity83 , @entity84			0
but dr @entity16 identified multiple flaws in the data collection and analysis of the 2004 research			2
by re-analysing the data , he showed that the number of admissions was unrelated to the lunar cycle			0
' the moon is innocent , ' dr @entity16 said			1
dr @entity16 cited what scientists refer to as the ' confirmation bias ' - people 's tendency to interpret information in a way that confirms their beliefs and ignore data that contradict them			1
when life is hectic on the day of a full moon , many people remember the association because it confirms their belief			2
but hectic days that do not correspond with a full moon are promptly ignored and forgotten because they do not reinforce the belief			2
the moon is even blamed when things get crazy at hospital emergency rooms ( stock image shown ) or birth wards			0
' some nurses ascribe the apparent chaos to the moon , but dozens of studies show that the belief is unfounded , ' said dr @entity16 , a @entity54 professor of planetary astronomy dr @entity16 said the societal costs of flawed beliefs can be enormous			1
in just one current example , the recent measles outbreak appears to have been triggered by parents ' questionable beliefs about the safety of the measles vaccine			0
' vaccines are widely and correctly regarded as one of the greatest public health achievements , yet vaccine - preventable diseases are killing people because of beliefs that are out of step with scientific facts , ' dr @entity16 said			1
a willingness to engage in evidence - based reasoning and admit that one 's beliefs may be incorrect will produce a more accurate view of the world and result in better decision - making , he said			0
' perhaps we can start by correcting our delusions about the moon , and work from there , ' dr @entity16 added			1
the study was published online by the journal @entity151 .			0

scientist at the @entity18 studied lunar myths
he found that full moons do not correlate with illnesses or ' hectic ' periods
people just thought they did because they remembered those days
