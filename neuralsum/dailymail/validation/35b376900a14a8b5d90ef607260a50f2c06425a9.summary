@entity0 may have taken the impact debut to another level with his goal after 79 seconds but he was not the first new cap to make a quick impression in @entity7 colours this season			1
in october , @entity9 left his mark on the @entity11 in more ways than one , adding much - needed			1
he was booked less than nine minutes into his first @entity7 start as he launched a series of tackles			1
for a time it was hard to know if his premature end would be via red card or substitution			2
@entity9 of @entity7 speaks to the media during the @entity7 press conference ahead of the clash with @entity24 @entity9 left his mark on the @entity11 in more ways than one , adding much - needed bite to @entity29 ’s midfield @entity9 cleaned up his disciplinary record to help international career after collecting 20 yellows in two years the @entity34 midfielder soon settled , however , and it turned out to be neither			1
he produced a terrific display in @entity37 and won his fourth cap against @entity39 on friday			1
he has also cleaned up his disciplinary record to help his international career and , after collecting 20 in two years , has just one yellow and one red in 26 appearances this season for club and country			2
‘ you ’ve got to be more careful , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ i like to tackle and i ’ve managed to curb it this season			2
i got the yellow against @entity51 and then the red against @entity53 but other than that i ’ve been pretty clean			1
i ’m usually on about nine or 10 bookings at this stage ! ‘ it ’s hard to lunge into tackles in international football			2
if you lunge in on a top - class international footballer they just skip round you or you bring them down			2
i tried to set a target			2
i ’ve been able to do that so i ’m quite proud			2
’ @entity0 made a big impact on debut twith his goal after just 79 seconds seconds at @entity68 both @entity0 and @entity9 shone for @entity7 as @entity29 's side swept @entity39 aside at @entity68 even so , his natural aggression lifted @entity7 in @entity51 , where a 2 - 0 win restored some of the confidence lost at the @entity74			1
‘ i remember lining up a few tackles and getting them wrong , but it did n’t faze me , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ it was one of those things			2
i tried to impose myself early on and mistimed it			2
after that it was just about trying to stay on my feet , trying to get through the game , trying to perform well , with good energy , keep the ball moving and i managed to do that			2
’ @entity86 can testify to this fondness for physical combat having been cut down by a teenage @entity9 during one of the regular games between the @entity92 staff and youth team			1
@entity86 , manager at @entity94 at the time , liked his style and picked him for the first team before he was 18			0
@entity39 's @entity97 tracks @entity34 and @entity7 midfielder @entity9 during the game at @entity68 ‘ those games did get quite tasty , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ i did tackle him and he tackled me back			0
they tended to get quite heated			0
he gave me my debut			1
i ’m so grateful to @entity86			0
and @entity103 , his assistant			0
@entity103 could kick a few people as well			0
’ this breakthrough rewarded years of commitment from @entity9 and his mother @entity107 , who would hop on various buses and trains together to get to academy training sessions			1
‘ it ’s funny to look back on this little kid jumping off the bus to training , ’ he said			0
‘ at one point , it would take three buses and one train			0
but it ’s worked out well			0
i ’ve always been pushed hard to succeed			0
to get those buses , it was nothing			0
’ as soon as he was able , he bought his mother a house			0
‘ she ’s my hero , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ we did n’t have a car , so she took me on the bus or on the train and she believed in me			0
she was just a great @entity129 and a great role model			0
’ @entity9 speaks to the media at an @entity7 press conference ahead of the midweek clash with @entity24 determination is a recurring theme for @entity9 , who swapped hometown @entity136 for @entity92 at the age of 11 and then joined @entity34 for £ 6million in 2009 , only to be hit by serious knee injuries			1
‘ i ruptured my anterior cruciate ligament , had bad medial ligament damage and tore my lateral meniscus and ( knee surgeon ) @entity144 managed to save that , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ i got back quite quickly and then broke down four times			0
i did my medial again on the other knee and then the knees were done and it was my ankles ; the left ankle , the right ankle a few times			0
it was a rollercoaster ride			0
it made me realise how much it takes to play at a high level and physically be strong			0
i worked really hard in the gym			0
@entity34 midfielder @entity9 has a pop at goal during @entity7 's clash with @entity39 at @entity68 ‘ i was confident of coming out the other end but there were always questions			1
is he going to get back to his best ? is he going to be the same player ? ’ as it turned out , he did get back , won his place back in the @entity34 team and took his @entity7 opportunity in the absence of @entity169 and @entity170			1
he missed two months with a shoulder injury soon after breaking into @entity29 ’s team but bounced back again , signing a new deal which ties him to @entity174 until 2019			0
at 25 , @entity9 is a regular in the @entity7 midfield			1
he is still making an impression , five months after his explosive full debut , and he has the cards under control .			1
