by @entity0 and @entity1 the @entity3 administration wants cars and light trucks to be fitted with technology that allows them to ' talk ' to each other about potential collisions			1
the @entity11 claimed the technology could prevent as many as 592,000 left - turn and intersection crashes a year , saving 1,083 lives - and on monday , the agency said it will begin drafting rules to require the technology in new vehicles			1
the technology uses a radio signal to continually transmit a vehicle 's position , heading , speed and other information			1
similarly equipped cars and trucks would receive the same information , and their computers would alert drivers to an impending collision			2
a car would ' see ' when another car or truck equipped with the same technology was about to run a red light , even if that vehicle were hidden around a corner			1

the government has said it is taking a step toward requiring cars be equipped with tech that enables them to warn each other of potential danger a car would also know when a car several vehicles ahead in a line of traffic had made a sudden stop and alert the driver even before the brake lights of the vehicle directly in front illuminate			1
adding the technology to new vehicles or retrofitting existing ones is expected to cost about $ 341 to $ 350 per vehicle in 2020 , but could decrease by more than $ 100 over time as manufacturers gain experience making the devices , the safety administration report said			1
if communities choose to invest in the technology , which works up to 300 yards away , roadways and traffic lights could start ' talking ' to cars , as well , sending warnings of traffic congestion or road hazards ahead in time for drivers to take a detour			1
the technology is separate from automated safety features using sensors and radar that are already being built into some high - end vehicles today and which are seen as the basis for future self - driving cars			2
but government and industry officials see the two technologies as compatible			0
if continuous conversations between cars make driving safer , then self - driving cars would become safer as well			2
communicating : the technology uses a radio signal to continually transmit a vehicle 's position and speed - and pick up the same information from other vehicles			1
it allows the cars to see if a collision is possible transportation secretary @entity99 called the vehicle - to - vehicle technology ' the next great advance in saving lives '			1
' this technology could move us from helping people survive crashes to helping them avoid crashes altogether - saving lives , saving money and even saving fuel thanks to the widespread benefits it offers , ' @entity99 said			2
it will take time for the technology to reach its full effectiveness since the current fleet of vehicles on the road will have to turn over or be retrofitted			0
once a critical mass of vehicles is equipped with the technology , they are expected to be able to follow each other safely at a close , pre-set distance on highways			0
such ' platoons ' or ' road trains ' hold the potential to enhance the flow of traffic and save fuel			0
the information sent between vehicles does not identify those vehicles , but merely contains basic safety data , @entity11 said			2
' the system as contemplated contains several layers of security and privacy protection to ensure that vehicles can rely on messages sent from other vehicles , ' the agency said			0
the @entity145 and the @entity146 praised the technology , but avoided commenting directly on the government 's intention to require the technology in new cars			1
instead , both groups urged the @entity153 to preserve the 5.9 ghz radio frequency for vehicle - to - vehicle communications			0
the frequency was initially expected to be dedicated to transportation technologies , but the commission has said it is exploring whether that frequency can be used for other wireless demands as well			0
' we understand the pressing need for additional spectrum and are open to sharing this spectrum if it can be done safely , ' said @entity165 , vice president for the alliance			0
' we continue to urge the @entity153 not to compromise the use of the spectrum until it is definitively established that sharing will not interfere with the safety of the driving public			0

the @entity11 *announced* on monday that it will start drafting rules to require the technology in new cars
it require radio signals to transmit a car 's position and speed ; others would then see if they were about to run a red light or had stopped suddenly
agency claims the technology could save 1,083 lives a year
it would cost cars around $ 350 to be fitted with the new technology
