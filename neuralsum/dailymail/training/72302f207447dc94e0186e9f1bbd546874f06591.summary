death in the desert : @entity23 , 25 , was found dead in the merciless @entity1 , @entity2 after setting out on a routine check of a water spring with his friend @entity11 @entity28 : the @entity1 in @entity2 is nearly 70,000 square miles of arid , sandy plains and dunes when they failed to return by late afternoon , a number of workers – including @entity35 trackers – set out into the darkness to look for them			1
close to midnight on a rough track , the headlights of a search vehicle driven by @entity39 from another cattle station picked out the body of mr @entity9 who had collapsed and perished from dehydration and exhaustion			1
a short time later mr @entity39 came across a highly distressed mr @entity11			1
‘ it was about 11.30pm when i came across @entity48 ’s body , ’ said mr @entity39			2
' i found @entity48 ’s hat and shirt and car keys where he ’d dropped them and i came across him a bit further down the track , but he was finished , ’ he told @entity56			1
‘ i was more wild with him for doing it than i was bloody sad for him – i thought he had more bloody sense than that			2
but anyway , that ’s the way it turned out			0
’ remote : the two men 's 4x4 got bogged down in sands near @entity19 in far western @entity20 the two men , he said , made many mistakes but the worst was walking away from their vehicle in the blazing heat – temperatures can reach 50c in the middle of the day in the @entity1			1
‘ they were only bogged , they had plenty of fuel , they could have just sat there with the air conditioning going until somebody found them			2
’ after finding mr @entity9 ’s body , mr @entity39 retraced his tracks and found mr @entity11 , who had been lying under a bush when he first drove past			1
he was close to death			0
‘ another hour and he would have been gone , too			0
he was just bloody lucky he got through – he did n’t even have a hat to start with , but he had a massive head of hair and that might have helped him a bit			0
‘ he was well and truly perished			0
his eyes were like owl eyes , wide open and sunk in his head … you could see his heart beating out of his chest and he reckoned he could n’t hear anything other than his heartbeat			0
’ search operation : a 4x4 drives down a dusty path in the @entity97 and @entity11 made a mistake by leaving their vehicle in the @entity101 heat police constable @entity102 , whose ‘ patrol ’ covers the region , said the two men were experienced in their work in the desert			1
‘ but this time it was just a series of small mistakes that led to one big one , ’ he said			2
‘ the desert is a beautiful place and we do look at it through our windows and it looks really nice			2
‘ but just because it ’s the 21st century and we have modern technology , do n’t think it wo n’t kill			0
’ later today the grief - stricken @entity9 family , who live in @entity119 , said they were planning to fly to rural @entity20 and talk to those who had found their son			1
‘ he was the best son ever , ’ said the dead man ’s mother , @entity125 , through her tears			0
‘ he was a gentle giant , the sort of kid who helped me even to do the ironing			0
he would hug you and was never shy to show his affection			0
’ mrs @entity23 said her son loved his conservation work and that she trusted his judgement			1
‘ we do n’t know exactly what happened yet but we ’re sure he would have made the right decision and looked after the other person he was with			0
’ mr @entity9 ’s younger sister @entity145 , and father , @entity147 , described his as a passionate and enthusiastic nature lover , dedicated to conservation			0
although mr @entity9 would sometimes shoot animals that were causing problems or were injured			0
