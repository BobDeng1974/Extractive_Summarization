below par : @entity0 struggled to impose himself during @entity3 's @entity6 qualifier against @entity5 talented : @entity0 impressed for @entity1 in his first season in @entity20 's top flight ' i found the right places , but i did not really exploit the opportunities that were there			2
i just lacked the final sharpness ' , @entity0 added			0
after being thumped at home by the same opponents during qualification for the @entity29 in @entity30 , it was a particularly rewarding win for @entity0 and co as they got their @entity6 qualifying campaign off to the best possible start			2
