hallucinogenic drugs may actually be good for you , a team of researchers has concluded			2
@entity5 scientists have carried out extensive research on the effects of @entity8 - or trips - by studying drugs surveys from tens of thousands of @entity11			1
the findings are at odds with the long held belief that lsd and other ' mind - enhancing ' drugs - such as mescaline and the drug psilocybin , found in magic mushrooms - result in flashbacks , paranoia and long term mental health problems			1
@entity5 scientists have carried out extensive research on the effects of ' mind - enhancing ' drugs - such as mescaline and the drug psilocybin , found in magic mushrooms - by studying drugs surveys from tens of thousands of @entity11 @entity29 - @entity28 and @entity30 from @entity5 ’s @entity31 in @entity32 examined the drug taking habits of more than 130,000 @entity11 citizens between 2001 and 2004			1
last year the duo even recommended that @entity8 could be an effective treatment for alcoholism			0
some 22,000 of those surveyed had taken psychedelic drugs at least once			0
their findings were published in the science journal @entity43			0
they wrote : ' there were no significant associations between lifetime use of any psychedelics , or use of @entity8 in the past year , and an increased rate of mental health problems			1
rather , in several cases psychedelic use was associated with a lower rate of mental health problems			2
' mr @entity28 said that previous studies on the psychedelic drugs had not proved that they caused chronic health problems in an interview with @entity5 ’s @entity60 news website , @entity61			2
dr @entity62 ( who died in may 1996 ) an @entity11 writer psychologist , was an advocate of psychedelic drug research and use			0
he is pictured here holding a press conference in @entity67 mrs @entity30 added : ' everything has some risk ; psychedelics can elicit temporary feelings of anxiety and confusion , but accidents leading to serious injury are extremely rare			0
' over the past 50 years , tens of millions of people have used psychedelics and there is just not much evidence of long - term problems			2
' instead , they said , the idea that the drugs caused mental health problems came from a small number of case studies , and that these patients were already suffering some form of mental illness			1
they said psychedelic drug use and mental health problems both occurred in late adolescence and so were wrongly linked by researchers , the @entity88 reports			1
last year , the pair wrote in the @entity93 that one dose of @entity8 was ' a highly effective treatment ' for alcoholics , and was ' just as effective ' as approved and currently used medications			0
sixty per cent of the patients tested who had been given a dose of @entity8 had either stopped drinking completely or were drinking less than they were before taking the drug .			0

study of drugs surveys on effects of @entity8 on tens of thousands of @entity11
@entity8 linked with flashbacks , paranoia and long term mental health problems
but @entity5 researchers said ' no evidence to link with health problems '
