after the first hat - trick of his professional career , @entity0 was on rock - solid ground as he launched into a defence of his goalscoring record			1
three in the @entity9 for @entity10 against @entity11 took his tally to six in 10 games for club and country this season , all scored from a central position , which he insists is the key to an extended run in the goals			1
‘ nobody can really criticise my finishing because they do n’t really see me playing in a forward position too often , ’ said @entity0			2
@entity0 scored a hat - trick for @entity10 in their 4 - 1 win against @entity11 on wednesday @entity0 chips the on - rushing @entity28 to complete his @entity9 hat - trick ‘ but now i ’m getting into these positions i want to be sticking the ball in the back of the net			1
‘ i ’m sure it ’s the same with every other striker			2
people can say i ’ve not scored enough goals , but you stick the best strikers on the wing in a four - man midfield and see if they score goals			2
‘ if you ’re getting goals and getting a run of games in your preferred position , your confidence is going to grow and performances are going to grow			0
that ’s something i ’m looking forward to doing , building on those performances			0
@entity0 's hat - trick and @entity55 's striker were enough for @entity10 to beat @entity11 @entity57 manager @entity56 watched the action from the stands at the @entity60 ‘ maybe beforehand i was n’t getting through on goal if i was coming from midfield			1
it ’s difficult to leave your position to go and get goalscoring opportunities , but i ’m getting into these positions much more regularly now , and i ’m looking forward to sticking the ball in the back of the net			0
’ former @entity10 manager @entity69 was among those who criticised @entity0 in front of goal			1
‘ @entity0 is a very willing boy , ’ said @entity69			2
‘ he works his socks off for the team			0
he ’s got to improve his finishing a lot though			0
’ two for @entity57 against @entity75 last month was a good start and three against @entity11 on wednesday even better , but the £ 16million signing from @entity78 has to prove he can be just as clinical in the big games against the big teams , starting against @entity81 at @entity82 on sunday			1
@entity10 had an awful record away from home against the best teams in the @entity87 last season			1
they were beaten 6 - 3 at @entity88 , 5 - 1 at @entity89 and 6 - 0 at @entity81			0
@entity92 , in 15 games against those same three teams , has scored only twice			0
@entity0 ’s record is similar , with one goal in 23 games against the same opposition for @entity78 and @entity10 , although some of those appearances were on the wing or from the bench			1
@entity0 was n't given a run of games as a central striker during his time at @entity78 @entity0 scored both goals for @entity57 in their 2 - 0 win over @entity75 in @entity107 he has made a promising start to his @entity10 career , rekindling memories of @entity111 with his finishing style on wednesday , but this is the challenge he must rise to if he is to develop like @entity111 into a truly great striker			1
@entity57 boss @entity56 was at the @entity60 to see @entity0 ’s hat - trick before confirming his place in the squad yesterday for next week ’s @entity118 qualifiers against @entity119 and @entity120			1
‘ it seems to me in the days of very large transfer fees that £ 16million does seem a fairly reasonable price to pay , ’ said @entity56			0
@entity10 striker @entity92 is currently on the sidelines as he recovers from an ankle injury @entity57 manager @entity56 at a press conference announcing his next international squa ‘ but it is up to @entity129 to show he is worth that money			1
if he continues to do so well that people are writing “ this was a steal ” or “ this was a great piece of business ” even better still			0
‘ with @entity129 , we need to be careful			0
he is getting more responsibility in the @entity87 and @entity9 and so far it seems to be going very , very well but let ’s not put too much pressure on him			0
‘ i hope it works out at the end of the season and i hope people say this was a good piece of business for @entity10 and they got a very good player at a good price			2
@entity149 ' electric ' - @entity148			0
