singles holidays are on the rise , with the biggest surge in demand from the over 50s traveller , according to research out today			1
holiday companies that run group tours in the @entity7 and overseas are reporting that 35 per cent of their clients now travel alone and they expect this figure to rise to 38 per cent in 2015 , based on advance bookings			1
as a result , many holiday companies , including @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 are offering incentives to attract people who are single , divorced or widowed , such as dedicated holidays for people travelling alone and , increasingly , the scrapping of single supplements			1
more and more of us are opting for singles holidays with the over 50s having the highest demand the analysis of 100,000 holiday bookings was carried out by 101 holidays which has launched a new website to meet the demand , 101 @entity29			1
the site has 101 suggestions for solo travellers selected by the award - winning travel writer , @entity35			1
@entity37 said : ' travelling solo has lost much of the lonely hearts stigma it once carried			1
and it 's not limited to the 18 - 30 age group backpacking around the world , with single people of all ages feeling more confident about travelling alone , especially women			1
@entity46 remains the most popular destination for singles , with a nice mix of sun , sea and ...			1
other singles new trips such as trkking in @entity54 are becoming popular with people who go away on their own ' our research showed that the average age of a solo traveller is now 54 and this is predicted to rise in future years			1
' not everyone holidaying alone is single , with more women leaving husbands and partners at home as they tick items off their bucket lists			2
the new figures also reflect changing @entity7 demographics with a growing population that is older , healthier and wealthier			0
@entity79 ( as part of a small group tour ) according to the research , 58.3 per cent of single holidaymakers are female			1
but that figure rises for more active and exotic trips such as walking holidays ( 64 per cent ) and @entity88 safaris ( 60 per cent )			1
men are more likely to take cycling and sailing trips			0
the most popular destination for dedicated singles holidays is @entity46 , followed by @entity78 , but travel companies say many solos are increasingly looking for adventure			1
popular trips include cruises on the @entity99 , trekking in @entity54 , viewing the @entity100 and gorilla trekking in @entity102			2
the report by 101 holidays is supported by research from the @entity106			2
its 2014 @entity107 found that 13 per cent of @entity7 holidaymakers now travel alone			2
but , it said , ' for people aged over 65 the figure rises to 21 per cent , suggesting older age groups are among the most independent when it comes to taking holidays '			1
@entity35 added : ' increasingly , travel companies are waking up to the fact that single travellers are big business with a huge choice of solo holidays now on offer , and some are negotiating with hotels to remove the dreaded single supplements			1
this is a trend that looks only set to increase			0
' the @entity100 can offer a supremely peaceful moment that can be enjoyed whether with others or alone @entity35 also points to an increasing growth in single parent holidays , with several companies scrapping supplements for mums or dads travelling alone with their kids			1
recent years have also seen a sharp hike in self - development and learning holidays which are growing in popularity among singles - including meditation , yoga , pilates , weight loss , cookery courses and creative writing			2
to make your booking on a singles holiday , visit www.101singlesholidays.co.uk making friends and joining a ' group ' is a good way to stay safe on holiday look confident look like you know where you 're going even if you do n't , and always try to learn a few key words in the local language including ' help '			2
do your research spontaneous travel is wonderful but a bit of advance planning goes a long way			0
try to memorise routes so you need n't look at maps too often , and try to avoid arriving late at night , but book taxis / transfers / accommodation in advance if you ca n't avoid that			0
expat blogs can also be a great source of tips and information			0
dress sensibly you 'll attract more negative attention and mark yourself out as a tourist by wearing inappropriate clothes			0
instead look at the advice on what travellers should wear to ensure it 's respectful to local culture , and you 're more likely to blend in			2
join a group if you 're planning a more intrepid adventure and you 're nervous about going solo , book a group tour with a travel company specialising in your destination as there 's often a large proportion travelling solo			1
for something more informal check out websites like @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 , to help you you meet other solo travellers			2
do n't forget common sense you would n't be careless with your valuables or walk alone at night in a strange city in the @entity7 , so do n't do it while you 're travelling			0
danger does n't lurk around every corner but do stay alert			0
book a guide if you 're worried about being hassled , a guide is a great barrier			0
even a short tour will help you find your bearings and get advice from a local before venturing out alone			0
learn to say no politely declining firmly with a smile and a thank you is the quickest way to deter all but the most insistent without unintentionally causing offence			0
trying to stay relatively sober if travelling as a single on holiday is a good idea stay ( fairly ) sober travel is all about enjoying yourself but having one too many drinks is a shortcut to potentially unsafe situations , whether that 's being more inclined to take risks or simply getting lost			2
protect your paperwork make scans of all your important documents , especially your passport , with a copy safely stored online , for example with @entity230			0
then if something is stolen , you can easily access the back - up			0
and always get a note of your hotel 's address and phone number , written in the local alphabet if it 's different			0
trust your instincts if something feels wrong or someone makes you feel uncomfortable , do n't ignore your instincts for the sake of politeness			0
there 's usually a good reason for your gut reaction so if you feel even slightly unsafe , get out as fast as possible .			0
