by @entity0 published : 08:08 est , 9 may 2012 updated : 16:20 est , 9 may 2012 wednesday : @entity1 arrives in court on the day of opening arguments in his voyeurism trial today a judge barred ' sexually graphic and obsessive ' diary entries belonging to the father - in - law of missing @entity9 mother @entity8 from being used at his trial , ruling they were irrelevant and would likely make jurors biased			1
it was the second victory in as many days for @entity14 , accused of 14 counts of voyeurism , after the same judge ruled on monday that a pornography charge against him should be dropped because the 2,000 images of his neighbor 's children taking a bath did not prove he influenced the conduct of the subject of the pictures			1
yesterday , judge @entity26 said eight journal entries , in which @entity14 discussed his obsession with his daughter - in - law @entity29 and sexual fantasies , were not admissible			1
' this is all about stalking @entity29 , ' judge @entity26 said of one entry @entity1 wrote about taking photos of his daughter - in - law in the driveway			1
samples from the entries included phrases like : ' @entity29 likes to be admired and i 'm a voyeur ' , ' i 'm a voyeur and @entity29 is an exhibitionist ' and ' i 've been going nuts and nearly out of control sexually my entire life , ' he did allow one entry to be used where @entity1 wrote : ' i enjoy taking video shots of pretty girls in shorts and skirts			1
i sometimes use these images for self stimulation			0
' @entity54 faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each of 14 counts against him			1
if convicted of all counts , he could face up to 70 years in prison			2
a jury of 12 men and women and two alternates were finally selected out of 70 , who had to answer questions about whether or not they were biased or had formed an opinion on the high - profile case			2
center of the debate : @entity1 kept pictures of @entity29 breastfeeding and changing and diary entries detailing he watched her often excerpts from @entity1 's diary read aloud in court defense attorney @entity77 argued yesterday the excerpts should not be used because it takes away from the voyeurism aspects of the trial and puts the focus on @entity8 and her husband @entity82 , who killed himself and the couple 's two sons in a fiery explosion in february at a house in @entity87			1
many believed the murder suicide was an admission of guilt in his wife 's disappearance but @entity94 and @entity95 have always maintained that @entity14 had something to do with their daughter 's disappearance			2
@entity100 was the only named person of interest in the case but was never charged or arrested			2
he claimed he took his young sons , then four and two , camping on the freezing winter night around 12.30am			0
when he came home , @entity29 was gone and he said she had run off with another man			2
authorities searched the desert for twelve days in the area where @entity100 said he went camping that night			0
at one point , they said they found a ' shallow grave ' after cadaver dogs alerted them to the spot			0
but they found no human remains			0
concerned : @entity29 's parents , @entity119 and @entity120 , hope that @entity14 ' slips ' and reveals something about the 2009 disappearance of their daughter defense attorney : @entity77 , left , talks to @entity1 , yesterday after a judge dismissed a child pornography charge against @entity1 , the father - in - law of missing @entity9 mother @entity8 defense attorneys argued that even the mention of @entity8 's name would prejudice a jury as it has been such a high - profile case , culminating in the murder of her sons earlier this year			1
it also emerged that a recording of @entity1 sexually gratifying himself while looking at pictures of @entity29 was discovered along with thousands of pictures that focused on her behind and taken while she was breastfeeding			1
@entity144 prosecutors agreed about the risk of prejudice , but said the passages were crucial to prove that @entity1 recorded the images , and that he did it for his sexual gratification			0
other categories of digital files included close - ups of women putting groceries in their cars and others titled , ' dmv girl ' , ' @entity159 ' , ' gum - chewing cutie ' , and ' young teen volleyball player '			0
opening statements in the trial are likely to begin on wednesday , assuming a jury is selected by then			2
center of the debate : @entity1 ( left ) previously claimed that he and @entity29 ( right ) were a perfect match because he was a voyeur and she enjoyed being watched @entity8 's parents @entity94 and @entity95 watched anxiously as @entity1 was led into the courtroom yesterday wearing handcuffs , a tie and gray suit			1
while more than 60 potential jurors filled out questionnaires in another room , prosecutors and defense attorneys discussed how much should be disclosed at the trial about @entity1 's apparent obsession with his son 's wife			0
if convicted of the remaining 14 charges , he would face a guideline sentence of about four years but the state has alleged aggravating circumstances that could result in a longer term			0
the thousands of images found by investigators reportedly show a decade â€™s worth of his work , but in this specific case they are expected to focus on the ones relating to the years 2006 and 2007			0
they volunteered to redact her name , and the judge and defense counsel agreed with the suggestion			0
revelations : @entity203 and @entity204 were beginning to speak more and more about their mother , saying she was ' in the trunk ' and then that she disappeared tragedy : @entity1 blew up his @entity210 home , pictured , killing himself and the two young boys when they were dropped off for a supervised visit happier times : @entity8 's parents , @entity94 and @entity95 , were living with her sons @entity203 ( left ) and @entity204 ( right ) at the time of the horrific incident remaining determined : @entity94 ( center ) and @entity95 ( right ) attended @entity1 's hearing monday @entity8 's disappearance took a bizarre turn last summer as authorities from @entity210 and @entity9 stepped up their efforts to solve the case			1
@entity1 claimed on tv that he and @entity8 had a sexually charged relationship , something her parents denied			1
@entity1 's arrest prompted the state to take custody of @entity100 's sons , who were living with their father at @entity1 's home			0
the boys were turned over to @entity8 's parents , prompting a custody fight that ended feb. 5 , when @entity100 locked a social worker out of his home during what was supposed to be a supervised visit with his sons			2
he attacked @entity203 and @entity204 , 7 and 5 , with a hatchet , then started a fire that killed all three as the social worker called 911 .			0
