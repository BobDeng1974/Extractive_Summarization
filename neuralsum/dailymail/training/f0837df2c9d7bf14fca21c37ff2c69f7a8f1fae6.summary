speaking near @entity55 's perimeter fence , mr @entity49 told the @entity1 : ' this is the new home of drone warfare in the @entity17 and there are questions about the growing use of these armed , unmanned systems			0
not here : the @entity4 began remotely operating its @entity64 unmanned aerial vehicles in @entity8 from the @entity30 airbase earlier this week , to the dismay of residents ' because of their remote nature , there is no risk to any of our forces and that makes it easier to launch weapons and makes it much easier for politicians to get involved in warfare			1
' mr @entity49 said the number of demonstrators present at the rally showed the strength of public feeling against the use of drones , particularly to target areas of @entity8 and @entity87			2
the activist added : ' in @entity87 there are reliable reports of a large number of civilian casualties and we do n't know about @entity17 use of drones because there is no information about what 's happening in @entity8			2
' veteran peace campaigner @entity99 , who has been living in a caravan adjacent to @entity14 , also addressed the protestors			2
the retired nurse and midwife , 74 , said she was disgusted the @entity17 was using @entity64 drones controlled from @entity17 soil			0

local resident @entity128 , aged 71 , was among those who backed the protest , which was organised by @entity37 , the @entity38 , the @entity36 , and @entity39			2
' my worry is that because they are controlling the drones from here , @entity55 is now a target , ' she said			0
lethal : campaigners are concerned the drones are being used to prolong the @entity140 with little public scrutiny drones : @entity4 - controlled @entity64 drones are used to gather intelligence on the ground in @entity8 , but also carry 500lb bombs and hellfire missiles for precision strikes ( file photo ) anger : the @entity37 called the drones a ' barbaric form of hi - tech killing ' ' we are just making ourselves a bigger target - they are controlled by kids in an air - conditioned room thousands of miles away with no concept of the devastation that they are causing			1
' in a speech to the protesters , stop the @entity36 convener @entity164 said : ' there is nothing like getting close up to these bases to see how menacing they are			1
' it brings home that ( the @entity17 is ) engaged in drone warfare - it is warfare which is operated remotely at absolutely no risk to anybody in this country but with terrible consequences for people in countries many , many thousands of miles away			0
' nobody knows how many have died and nobody knows their names			0
' @entity182 , vice-chair of the @entity36 , voiced concern that drones were being used to continue the so - called ' war on terror ' with little or no public scrutiny			1

' important weapon ' : the @entity18 says the aircraft are operated by highly - trained military pilots who engage in the same rules of conflict as traditional @entity4 aircraft ground the @entity198 : protesters held up banners and waved ' peace ' signs during their afternoon of action @entity37 's general secretary , @entity204 , was also fiercely critical of armed drones , saying in a statement : ' it 's time to end this remote killing before even more innocent civilians are slaughtered			1
' they are the main victims in this barbaric form of high - tech killing			1
' the @entity18 says drones have played a vital role supporting military operations in @entity8 and have ' undoubtedly ' helped to save the lives of military personnel and those of countless @entity8 civilians			1
defence officials have also stressed that @entity64 drones are primarily operated in @entity8 in a surveillance and reconnaissance role			0
rally : opponents say use of the remote controlled drones in war - torn countries like @entity8 is a blot on the @entity17 's copybook and called for missions to stop an @entity18 spokesman said : ' we fully respect people 's right to protest peacefully and within the law			1
' @entity64 aircraft are piloted by highly trained professional military pilots who adhere strictly to the same laws of armed conflict and are bound by the same clearly defined rules of engagement which apply to traditionally manned @entity4 aircraft			1
