' i put on about 12 kilos since my diagnosis , so it was a bit confronting getting topless because of that aspect , ' she said			0

' that 's what took her in the end unfortunately , ' ms @entity4 said			2
' i was always really conscious of my risks because i saw what @entity76 went through , and i 'd check at the start of every month			0

she got a scan and doctors confirmed that she had stage two breast cancer , and would need to have a double mastectomy			1
but removing her breasts did n't worry her			0
she always knew she was high risk because her mother had breast cancer in her early 30s and ovarian cancer in her early 40s she has been deeply touched by the feedback her photos have gotten since photographer @entity93 shared them on his @entity96 page ' i basically told my doctor i 'm fine with you taking them , ' ms @entity4 said			1
' they were no longer my breasts , they were like ticking time bombs attached to me			0
' she had discussed taking photos of her body post-surgery with photographer @entity93 , but once she started chemotherapy in july she was too exhausted to go through with it			2
then , earlier this month , mr @entity93 got back in contact			0

' ms @entity4 had 12 embryos frozen before she started chemotherapy , and hopes to start trying for children with partner @entity126 , 19 , at the end of this year			1
for now she is ned - no evidence of disease - but she knows there is a risk the cancer could return			0
' a lot of people think as soon as you 're out of treatment you 're all better but that 's a perception that 's not correct , ' she said			0
' if it does come back that 's usually when it has metastasised and it 's gone to your brain or liver or bones or lungs or another part of your body , and once it 's metastasised it 's classed as stage 4 and stage 4 is incurable			0
' that 's what 's so scary about it			0
' she said her partner had stuck by her side and been totally supportive ever since her diagnosis			0
ms @entity4 said removing her breasts did n't worry her : ' they were no longer my breasts , they were like ticking time bombs attached to me ' but ms @entity4 plans to get through life the way she handled her cancer diagnosis – with confidence and a positive attitude			1
she has been deeply touched by the feedback her photos have gotten since photographer mr @entity93 shared them on his @entity96 page			2
' before @entity93 released it i did put a status on @entity96 saying a trigger warning , they are confronting images , do n't look if you know you 'll be affected by it , ' ms @entity4 said			2
' because my self - esteem is probably at its lowest with no hair , no eyelashes and eyebrows just growing back			0
' i wanted to tell people to be kind because i do n't think i could take any unnecessary nasty comments			0
' but people have been so amazing and so positive			0
' i 'm glad that i did it			0
