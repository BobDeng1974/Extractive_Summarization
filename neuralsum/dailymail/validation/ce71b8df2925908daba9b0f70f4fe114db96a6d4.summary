within weeks of @entity1 releasing its waterproof @entity2 last year , @entity0 filed a patent that took its rival ’s technology a step further			1
called ‘ methods for shielding electronic components from moisture ’ , the filing awarded today describes a way of making the inside of a phone waterproof rather than the outside			1
individual components would be covered in a thin film designed to stop liquids damaging the phone , even if it manages to penetrate the outer casing			1
the patent said protective cases have ‘ little value ’ once water has entered the phone and details a system of adding ‘ hydrophobic coating to components ’			1
this coating would be applied using plasma - assisted chemical vapour deposition in which thin films are applied from a gas , or vapour , states to a solid state @entity1 ’s @entity2 is @entity34 rated thanks to a hydrophobic coating and cover that clips into place to protect the handset			1
the firm also added a rubberized gasket behind the back cover and added a waterproof coating inside the headphone jack			2
@entity34 stands for @entity34 , and was created by the @entity45			0
it is used to classify how much a coating provides protection from ' intrusion or immersion '			0
the rating is typically followed by two numbers - the first is the level of dust resistance , the second is water resistance			0
dust resistance ranges from zero to six , and water resistance ranges from zero to nine			0
if an x is included , the device does n't offer a classified rating for that substance			0
a rating of seven on the waterproof scale means : ' ingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water ( up to one metre )			0
' as a result , the @entity2 can be submerged for up to half an hour at around 3ft ( 0.9 metres )			0
however its latest models , the @entity70 and @entity71 , have removed this feature			0
@entity0 ’s patent would instead involve coating individual components inside a phone , and within an already assembled circuit board			1
this coating would be applied using a method called plasma - assisted chemical vapour deposition ( @entity82 ) , which desposits thin films from gas , or vapour , states to solid states			1
the plasma is typically created between two electrodes where reacting gases are added to form the solid			2
in the case of the fully - assembled circuit board and its electromagnetic interference ( @entity94 ) shields , @entity0 proposes perforating ‘ portions of the shields that overlay water sensitive electronics			1
’ the coating would be applied through these perforations , and the board - to - board connectors would be covered by a silicone seal			2
the filing said : ‘ people who rely on electronic devices tend to carry them along to locations in which the electronic devices can incur damage			0
‘ one form of damage that can be detrimental to an electronic device is water damage			2
@entity1 ’s @entity2 ( pictured ) is @entity34 rated thanks to a hydrophobic coating and cover that clips into place to protect the handset			1
the firm also added a rubberized gasket behind the back cover and waterproof coating inside the headphone jack			2
as a result , the @entity2 can be submerged for up to 30 minutes at 3ft ( 0.9 metres ) in the case of the fully - assembled circuit boards and electromagnetic interference ( @entity94 ) shields , @entity0 proposes perforating ‘ portions of the shields that overlay water sensitive electronics			1
’ the coating would be applied through these perforations , and the board - to - board connectors would be covered by a silicone seal ‘ many electronic devices are susceptible to water damage because they are not fully sealed and include various openings for charging , connecting peripherals , and inputting and outputting audio			1
‘ while bulky cases have had a certain amount of success at mitigating water entry through the aforementioned openings , a protective case is of little or no value once water has entered a device housing			2
‘ when water enters into the device housing , some high powered components and wiring are often subject to damage even when a minimal amount of water enters the electronic device			0
‘ in particular , corrosion of soldered components is quite common and can lead to device failure			0
’ meanwhile the board - to - board connectors inside the phones ( components illustrated left ) would be covered by a silicone seal			0
despite adding waterproof features to its @entity2 , @entity1 removed this for its latest @entity70 and @entity167 handsets unviled at @entity168 on sunday ( right )			1

the patent was filed in the @entity171 in march 2014 and awarded today
it says protective cases have ‘ little value ’ once water has entered the phone
files detail a system of adding ‘ hydrophobic coating to components ’
coating would be applied via plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition
this involves depositing a thin film from a gas state to a solid
@entity0 proposes perforating circuit boards and applying the film inside
the technology could form part of the @entity0 ’s @entity197 7 range
rival @entity1 ’s @entity2 is @entity34 rated waterproof , but its @entity70 is *n’t*
