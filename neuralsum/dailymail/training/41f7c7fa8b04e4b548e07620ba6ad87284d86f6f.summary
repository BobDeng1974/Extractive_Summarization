by @entity0 for @entity1 first there was the cronut , a calorific hybrid of doughnut and croissant which had sugar lovers across the world queuing outside bakeries for hours			0
and now two chefs have combined forces , and flavours , to create what they think might just be the next big thing in pastries - a doughnut filled with stewed beef			1
@entity18 and @entity19 from @entity20 have been perfecting their recipe for the ' moonut ' for almost a year after the former was made redundant			1
after establishing themselves as @entity38 , the pair tried a number of different combinations to no avail			2
' back when we were thinking about making the business we were playing around with doughnuts and we decided to try to make something savoury			0
' it 's been trial and error			0
there have been some pretty serious fails - like the cheese and bacon one which was truly foul			2
' but the moonut , made with @entity27 - stewed beef shin , has taken off			1
the chefs from @entity20 sell their goods at @entity57 every second and fourth thursday in the month after numerous failed attempts , they are happy to have come up with something they think the public will enjoy the chefs were inspired by the success of the cronut ( pictured ) - a combination of a doughnut and croissant ' this one works because rather than having sugar on the outside we use powdered shitaki mushrooms and a dusting of paprika			1
' it 's been a mixed reaction			0
some people have been really interested in it and others have just said " what ? " '			0
' but the feedback from everyone who has tried them has been really good			0
' the moonut is sold every second and fourth thursday at @entity85 , and costs £ 3.50			1
it is sold alongside other locally sourced goods prepared by @entity38 .			2

the moonut is filled with @entity91 @entity27 - stewed beef shin
it is the creation of two @entity20 chefs , the @entity38
sold every *fortnight* at @entity57 , @entity20 , for £ 3.50
