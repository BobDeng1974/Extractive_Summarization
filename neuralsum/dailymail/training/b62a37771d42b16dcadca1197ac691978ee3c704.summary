@entity3 has endured a wretched time at @entity14 , scoring only once since his £ 5million move from @entity16 in june 2013 and being restricted to a handful of starts because of a serious knee problem , but @entity0 's faith in him is total			1

' we have players performing in that number 10 position – @entity41 and @entity42 - and with @entity11 and @entity3 we are strong in that department			1
' we are not looking at this window to find solutions			1
we worked in the summer to find solutions so the work is to get players back in confident mood			2
we have not lost any of the talent of last season			2
saying that we will always try to use the window in our favour			2
the work now is to recover the confident mood of the players			2
' @entity3 has scored just one goal since moving to @entity5 for £ 5million in 2013 @entity11 ( left ) and @entity3 ( right ) are now the only two recognisable first team strikers at the club @entity0 also insisted that the penalty miss by @entity61 is now ' water under the bridge ' @entity0 - who insists the controversial penalty miss from @entity61 against @entity64 is now ' water under the bridge ' - is hopeful that key midfielder @entity67 will be back to face @entity68 on saturday			1

' he will be refreshed and fully fit			0
we want him to get back and be the same way			0

we are well aware of how difficult it will be			0
they have a lot of pace and defend very well			0
we know that we are in a position where we want to get more points			0

we have seen that @entity93 is a really tough place to go but we are looking forward to going there			0
