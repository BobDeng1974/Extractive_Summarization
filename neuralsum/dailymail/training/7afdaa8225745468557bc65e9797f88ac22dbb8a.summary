by @entity1 reporter published : 16:55 est , 10 may 2013 updated : 13:20 est , 13 may 2013 @entity2 will soon be missing an unlikely inhabitant to its rarefied row of multi-million dollar homes as @entity7 great @entity6 puts his $ 30 million @entity9 condo on the market			2
the four - time @entity12 champion will likely be driving away from the place even richer than when he purchased the @entity2 adjacent digs in 2007 for a mere $ 9.67 million			2
and $ 30 million is just the asking price since many well - heeled @entity17 ( or wannabe @entity18 ) will undoubtedly be clamouring for a spot in the highly sought - after building at 15 @entity2			1
steal : @entity7 superstar @entity6 has put his @entity2 condo on the market for a cool $ 30 million the @entity23 calls the building the ‘ reigning superstar of @entity9 trophy residences , ’ and @entity6 ’s apartment , with its @entity27 cherry floors , spatterings of flamed black granite , and other precocious appoints is front and center of the pack			1
his unit , number @entity35 , is located in the building ’s preferable 20 - story frontispiece , known only as ‘ @entity39 , ’ which allows sprawling views just at the edge of the treetops in the city ’s favorite strip of woodland			2
the great room in @entity6 ’s 3,454 - square - foot residence offers the lucky buyer a personalized view of the park			1
through the residence ’s only glass doors ( the rest are rift - cut oak ) , those eating in the dining area are also privy to peeks at nature			0
less desirable is ‘ the @entity59 , ’ a tower that rises 43 - stories behind ‘ the @entity39 ’ and offers views of the @entity63			0
breathtaking : the 3,454 - square - foot stunner offers treetop views of @entity2 the best : @entity6 's pad is located at the most desired address in the already beloved row of multi-million dollar apartment buildings , 15 @entity2 kitchen : the elegant kitchen features @entity73 ceramic floors and @entity75 stone backsplash upon entering the lavish abode , visitors step upon bronze - inlaid flooring in the foyer and pass a powder room with a limestone vanity just past the cloak room			1
a steel - topped oak built - in that @entity6 calls ‘ the sushi bar ’ is the living room ’s centrepiece and hides a refrigerator underneath			1
from there , one may tiptoe across the @entity73 ceramic floors past the finest culinary appointments , a wine cooler , and @entity75 stone backsplash			0
bathroom : all three bedrooms have en suite baths and the master bath features a stand - up shower with room for two bedrooms : the condo 's bedroom wing has window 's facing the building 's verdant courtyard and for those who are invited , the master suite beyond offers a roomy 743 - square - feet of slumber space			1
for now , though , that room is reserved — as is the entirety of the pristine and playful pad — for @entity6 and wife @entity111			0
whoever ends up buying the place will have the two of them to thank			0
the pair purchased the apartment from the offering plan , so it came to them as ‘ a big white box with high ceilings			0
’ dining room : those lucky enough to be invited are treated to @entity2 views while they eat @entity126 : @entity27 cherry wood hugs the floors and flamed black granite accents peek out throughout the home so both the compliments and hefty dividends , like those driver has been earning for years , will be well - deserved			1
and before you ask why the couple wants to leave the breathtaking condominium , agent @entity134 of @entity135 has an answer , straight @entity6 himself			0
she said the stock car legend has chosen now as a time to sell because ' the demand for trophy apartments is pretty strong			0
' modern : @entity6 calls the big , steel - topped built - in bar ' the sushi bar'c sensible : the unlikely @entity2 dweller usually calls @entity148 home and reportedly wants to unload the place because ' demand for trophy apartments is pretty strong '			2

the 3,454 - square - foot apartment is located in the most sought after building in an already desirable locale
@entity27 cherry floors , sushi bar , and breathtaking views of @entity2 are just some of the *benefits* of the stunning *pre-war* property
