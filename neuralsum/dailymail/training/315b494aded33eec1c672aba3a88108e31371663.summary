' they used to bark all the time and if they had been there someone would have heard them			2
@entity55 for evidence : a police officer searches a drain near mrs @entity11 's home ' it ’s out of order , someone targeting a women like that because she ’s old			1

it ’s really , really sad			0
' something should have been done and somebody should have looked after her and then this would n’t have happened			0
