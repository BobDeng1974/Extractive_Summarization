by @entity0 published : 18:16 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 18:18 est , 31 january 2014 inspiration : @entity4 @entity3 before her death some people fill the space around them with a kind of life force , and my friend @entity10 was just such a person			1
i could hardly believe it when i received an email from her family , telling me of her violent death , plummeting from the roof of a 15 - storey building in @entity18 , on the morning of january 22			1
@entity4 had gone to @entity19 to have a straightforward cosmetic surgery operation in a renowned @entity18 clinic			1
the operation lasted 13 hours , after which she was removed to a recovery room under 24 - hour nursing supervision			1
a few hours later she came round in a state of panic and paranoia , which the doctors described as post-anaesthetic psychosis			1
this apparently happens in around 2 per cent of such procedures			2
she overpowered the nurse , stripped off her clothes and ran towards the first exit			2
@entity4 made her way to the roof , where she stayed for over three hours , alternately sitting and teetering along the edge			1
a team of doctors talked to her , but she was unresponsive			2
eventually she stood up , and leapt off the building to her death			2
even as i write this , i can not imagine a more horrible , frightening and awful way to die			2
in every article i have read about @entity4 this week , she has been written of — or off — as a ‘ socialite ’			1
she was so much more than that			2
i first met @entity4 in the early @entity49 , when i was running the marketing department at @entity51 , the jewellers , in @entity52			1
she was 19 , and the youngest person in my team			2
she already had a poise about her , and a self - assurance and serenity that was older than her years			2
five of us shared an office tucked away in the dickensian labyrinth of the @entity51 building			2
@entity4 ’s innate sense of design was apparent in everything that she did , from the layout of the catalogues to how a window display was arranged			1
she always had an opinion , quietly but emphatically stated , and invariably right			2
she was always immaculately groomed , and i can still see her — vividly — striding down @entity52 on her endlessly long legs , with a clipboard and pen , taking notes on the window displays , then making seemingly minute alterations which immediately made an enormous difference			1
@entity4 worked with me at @entity51 for three years , but was becoming increasingly frustrated at having no direct outlet for her evident and growing jewellery - design talents			1
one day , i remember bringing to the office an amber necklace given to me by my step grandmother			2
three weeks later , this previously old - lady necklace was transformed into a bohemian chain , with additions of carved golden beads and black glass			2
memories : @entity4 , right , stands with @entity0 , second right with a man dressed as @entity90 last march , when @entity4 was in @entity91 , i wore it when we met for lunch			1
‘ not bad , ’ she said of it , ‘ not bad at all			2
’ in 1983 @entity4 had an opportunity to go to @entity97			1
at the time she was in a relationship that had run its course , but she did n’t quite have the courage to admit it			2
day after day she would appear bleakly in the office , unable to decide what to do with her life			2
finally i took her out to lunch , and said that i was going to make the decision for her			0
i told her that if she did n’t take the opportunity to go to @entity97 , i would fire her			0
in an email to me last year , she mentioned this : ‘ how right you were to push me out of the door of @entity112 all those years ago … never looked back … though i do sometimes ache for the @entity112 countryside , especially old trees and dank earth			0
’ she quickly established herself in @entity97 , and eventually met and married @entity117 @entity116 , a former @entity118 executive , with whom she had three children			0
her creative energy went into designing unusual one - off pieces of jewellery , oriental in style , using carved jade , semi-precious stones and beaten silver			0
plunge : @entity127 jumped from the roof of a clinic in @entity19 ( black building , pictured right ) she became highly successful , ( as i knew she would be ) and organized exhibitions all over the world			1
for many years she had a collection at the upmarket @entity135 fashion boutique @entity134 in @entity91			0
@entity4 co-founded a charity called the @entity137 , for children in @entity139 , which was funded with the profits from her business			1
she was that rare combination - a creative talent and a successful business woman			0
she enjoyed all of the good things that she and her husband had worked for , but never , ever forgot those less fortunate than herself			1
she started an appeal after the recent terrible typhoon in the @entity150 , and raised a substantial amount of money and goods			0
not content with doing that , she got on a plane with @entity116 , and helped on the ground with the distribution of disaster aid			0
talented : @entity3 pictured later in her life there are wealthy women whose involvement in charity work consists just of attending fundraising dinners and getting their names on committees , but @entity4 got involved at the sharp end			1
she was genuinely compassionate , and never in it for any mentions she might receive in fashionable magazines			1
we kept in touch intermittently over the years , and i would see her when she came through @entity91			0
each time i saw her she looked increasingly glamorous , but underneath she was still the same down - to - earth @entity4			1
she would , on every occasion , say how blessed she felt - surrounded by her family , and doing work that she loved			0
she had an elusive presence , which is difficult to capture on the page			0
her most overwhelming characteristic was an absolute serenity			0
the precocious self - assurance of her late teens had matured into an almost tangible calmness			0
yoga , for @entity4 , was almost a way of life			1
in 2004 , on the last day of a family holiday in @entity190 , her son , @entity188 , died in a swimming accident			1
he had gone to the pool for a final swim , and was doing underwater laps when he lost consciousness			0
he was 12 years old			0
@entity4 ’s strength in coping with the death of her only son was humbling to witness			1
she accepted that his allotted time on earth had ended , and told me that she felt blessed to have had the time she did with him			0
a few years later , she came to see me at our home in @entity206			0
she brought copies of a painting that @entity188 had done shortly before he died			1
i remember the vivid colours , a rainbow on a bridge , with a figure half way across , seen through an arch of light ( @entity215 had clearly inherited his mother ’s artistic sense )			0
@entity4 was convinced that @entity188 had some intimation of his own mortality , and that this painting was his subliminal way of expressing it ... his last good bye			1
@entity4 was not a conventionally religious person , but she believed in @entity226 , and had a deep spirituality			1
in my study i have a photograph she sent me , taken on that last family holiday			0
the photo portrays a tight family group : @entity116 and @entity4 and their beautiful girls , with @entity188 smiling cheekily in the centre			1
i look at it now , and weep for them all			0
some people are described as life - enhancing			0
@entity4 was more than that ; she was life - affirming			1
i can hear her mellifluous voice as i sit at my computer			0
i am as certain as i can be that she would not want anyone to grieve for her for too long			0
she will be with @entity188 , and she would want us to understand this , and celebrate that reunion			0
from there , she ’d want us to celebrate her life , and the joy and passion with which she lived it			0
her memorial service is being held in @entity254 in @entity97 , which held a special place in her heart			0
friends are being asked not to send flowers - @entity4 abhorred the waste of flowers at ceremonies - but to dress in bright colours ‘ to create the most colourful and precious bouquet of all for @entity4 : one made up of her beloved friends and family ’			1
the last email i received from @entity4 was on december 29			1
she had spent @entity90 in the @entity150 with @entity116 and the girls , her parents and @entity116 ’s family			0
she wrote : ‘ it is good to be able to give back a little of the love we were given			0
’ @entity4 gave love in abundance			1
i still can not believe that she has gone , and am devastated for all those she has left behind			0
the words she wrote for @entity188 ’s funeral in november 2004 seem all the more poignant now : ‘ sharing this pain has helped us understand what it means to be surrounded by love , your prayers have bolstered us , your voices have soothed us : in this moment of utter pain we have found a strength ... we will find a way to come to terms with @entity188 ’s death			0
it is truly at a moment like this that one understands the meaning of the word love			0
’ i pray that @entity4 ’s family will be able to draw on her strength and love , which must surely live on in their hearts .			1
