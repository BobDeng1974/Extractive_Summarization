after his first win in october , mr @entity2 , 53 , was bombarded by phone calls from ambulance chasers promising him compensation for a road accident			1
@entity22 up , mr @entity2 invoiced the law firm £ 10 for every minute he wasted answering their phone calls			1

yesterday , the company sent him a cheque for £ 230 for bothering him five times over two days			2
in a letter to @entity36 , the company behind the nuisance phone calls , mr @entity2 said : ‘ i have been cold called by your telemarketing about a supposed car accident , despite being registered with the @entity29 for years , not being involved in a relevant car accident , and never having opted in to any telemarketing with you or anybody else			1
‘ i notified [ the caller ] that if i had to deal with any other calls from your organisation or people involved with your organisation that i would be charging £ 10 per minute for my time , use of phone and electricity			2
despite making these efforts to stop being called , i was called yet again several times			0
