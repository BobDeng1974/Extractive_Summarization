@entity1 risk losing another top talent , having failed to open talks with @entity4 under - 20 star @entity5			1
it is another test of their commitment to young players after the loss of @entity12 star @entity11 to @entity13			0
midfielder @entity5 , who was named on the bench by @entity15 against @entity16 last weekend , is able to talk to other clubs from january 1 as the clock runs down on his deal which expires next summer			1
@entity5 in action for @entity1 during their @entity23 defeat against @entity24 @entity5 runs away from @entity26 's @entity25 during an under 21 game last season still only 18 , he is one of the development players promoted by @entity30 to be part of the first - team squad this season in the belief he has the ability to make it at @entity37			1
he was picked by @entity4 for an under - 20s tournament in @entity39 last summer — a rare accolade for a @entity42 - based player			2
the stand - off over his future has echoes of @entity11 , who became a symbol for the lack of long - term planning at @entity37 in sir @entity50 ’s final years when he was allowed to leave for nothing after failing to agree a new deal			0
embarrassingly , @entity1 later considered buying him back for £ 50million after he ’d gone on to become the best young midfield player in @entity54			1
@entity5 could be involved against @entity55 today having scored for @entity56 against @entity57 in midweek			1
he was born in @entity58 to @entity60 parents			0
@entity5 and @entity61 celebrate winning the @entity63 trophy in may i joined @entity1 from @entity65 aged 16			1
he was recently taken aside by @entity30 for a pep talk with the @entity1 boss rating him alongside @entity61 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 as @entity1 ’s best home - grown players			1
@entity30 said last night : ‘ the class of ’ 92 were guardians of the culture of the club			0
it is very important that a club like @entity1 have guardians and therefore you need a very good youth education			2
‘ it is very important and i did it with @entity84			0
i gave debuts to @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			0
‘ i want to do that but the youth player has to take their chance			0
’ @entity30 ’s big decision today is if and how he can squeeze his ‘ famous five ’ — @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 — into the same team			0
