@entity0 today conceded there are alternative ‘ options ’ to the @entity4 pound as the crisis deepened over his plans for an independent @entity8 ’s currency			1
the first minister denied that he does not have a back - up plan , signalling that he could go into this year ’s referendum with a proposal for a new @entity8 currency			1
but mr @entity0 is coming under intense pressure to reveal his chosen ‘ plan b ’ , with the country ’s top business leaders demanding answers			0
under pressure : @entity0 said other options were presented by the @entity22 's ' fiscal commission working group ' ¿ which included a ' new @entity8 currency ' the row comes after chancellor @entity25 , shadow chancellor @entity26 and @entity28 chief @entity27 this week comprehensively rejected any deal to share the pound in a ‘ currency union ’ with a separate @entity8			1
the game - changing move has left the @entity34 in disarray just seven months before @entity8 ’s future is decided on september 18			1
mr @entity0 said other options were presented by the @entity22 ’s ‘ fiscal commission working group ’ – which included a ‘ new @entity8 currency ’ , either with a fixed exchange rate to the pound or a ‘ floating ’ exchange rate			1
a ‘ @entity8 pound ’ could be pegged on a one - to - one basis with the @entity4 pound , in the way the @entity44 pound was until 1979			1
there would be a @entity8 central bank to replace the @entity51 to ensure the credibility of the currency , and there would need to be large reserve of sterling			2
mr @entity0 ’s fiscal commission found last year : ‘ in the long run , the creation of a new @entity8 currency would represent a significant increase in economic sovereignty			2
’ however , it would be a major challenge to decide how contracts , savings , pensions and salaries would be converted at the start into values in the new currency			0
' keeping millions of @entity4 pounds in reserve would also limit @entity8 ministers ’ ability to invest in public services			2
and if the markets were unsure about a new @entity8 currency , a premium could be added to interest rates – forcing @entity8 to pay more for loans and mortgages			2
mr @entity25 used a speech in @entity83 to insist the currency was not like a @entity86 collection to be divided up in the event of a ' messy divorce ' during an exchange on @entity92 's @entity91 , first minister @entity0 was keen to stress there were alternatives to an independent @entity8 keeping the pound : @entity92 's @entity95 : does that mean in the event of a yes vote you go into negotiations without another option in your back pocket ? @entity0 : well let me say for the third time @entity104 that the fiscal commission working group set out all of the monetary policy options for an independent @entity8 but recommended the best one was a sterling area and that ’s the one that we ’re going to be articulating and that ’s what you ’d expect us to do …			1
@entity95 : ok @entity0 says there is no alternative ... @entity0 : no i did n’t say that @entity104 , i said ... @entity95 : i ’m just checking ... @entity0 : try again , i said the @entity117 set out a range of monetary policy options for an independent @entity8			1
other currency options include unilaterally choosing to use the pound with no control over monetary policy – adopting a formula used by @entity125 , @entity126 and the @entity127			0
yesterday , a graphic appeared on yes @entity8 ’s @entity130 page which stated : ‘ an independent @entity8 would not need @entity132 ’s permission to continue using the pound			1
’ or a separate @entity8 government could try to persuade @entity136 nations to let the country join the @entity138 – which was once mr @entity0 ’s favoured option			1
mr @entity0 was interviewed on @entity92 radio show @entity91 , after spending much of thursday at his @entity142 home and avoiding the tv cameras as his independence plans crumbled around him			0
the first minister was asked by presented @entity95 if he would go into negotiations following a ‘ yes ’ victory ‘ without another option in your back pocket ’ ? ‘ the fiscal commission working group set out all of the monetary policy options for an independent @entity8 but recommended the best one was a sterling area , and that ’s the one we ’re proposing and that we ’re going to be articulating and that ’s what you ’d expect us to do , ’ mr @entity0 replied			1
‘ ok @entity0 says there is no alternative , ’ mr @entity162 continued , before the @entity164 leader interrupted him and said : ‘ no i did n’t say that @entity104			0
’ mr @entity95 then challenged the first minister : ‘ so there is an alternative			0
what is it ? ’ ‘ the fiscal commission working group set out a range of options , ’ mr @entity0 conceded			0
asked if the options were ‘ off the table ’ , the first minister added : ‘ they ’re in the fiscal commission working group			0
they ’re there and have been there for the past year			0
’ mr @entity25 said it is clear that as chancellor he could not recommend that the @entity4 could share the pound with an independent @entity8 conservative chancellor @entity25 : the evidence shows it would n’t work			1
it would cost jobs and cost money and would n’t provide economic security for @entity8 or for the rest of the @entity4			2
people need to know – that is not going to happen			0
' @entity192 chief secretary to the treasury @entity27 : ' this is n't bluff , or bullying , it 's a statement of fact			1
the @entity164 's claims that an independent @entity8 could or should be able to share the pound are pure fiction			1
' @entity202 shadow chancellor @entity26 : ' you ’d be trying to negotiate a monetary union as @entity8 is pulling away from the @entity4			1
it wo n’t happen , i would n’t recommend it			0
@entity8 will not keep the pound if @entity8 chooses independence			2
' former chancellor @entity210 said : ‘ the penny has dropped for @entity0 – he knows he can not promise the pound			0
‘ @entity0 is offering us one of two options : a rush to join the euro or a separate unproven currency			0
' both currency options would be bad for jobs as every time we sold to our biggest customer , @entity221 , @entity8 firms would need to pay the costs of changing currency			2
’ @entity226 leader @entity225 said : ‘ the first minister has effectively conceded that the sterling currency with the @entity4 will not happen			0
‘ he pointed towards the options in his fiscal commission but he needs to tell us which one he ’d choose			0
' would it be the euro or a separate @entity8 currency ? the clock is ticking			2
’ @entity235 , chief executive of @entity236 – whose members include @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 – added : ‘ it is as clear as it can be at this stage , that a currency union is not an option for an independent @entity8			1
‘ it would now be prudent for businesses to consider the specific effects adopting remaining options could have on their business			0

first minister insists he has a back - up plan if voters back independence
@entity25 ruled out currency union with an independent @entity8
@entity202 's @entity26 and @entity192 @entity27 then supported the move
@entity8 government *accused* @entity132 politicians of ' bullying '
