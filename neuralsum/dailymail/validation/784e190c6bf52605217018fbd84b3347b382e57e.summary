human rights lawyers smeared @entity2 soldiers with false accusations of the torture and murder or innocent @entity6 , a government dossier claims			1
a report drawn up on the prime minister 's orders claims public interest lawyers ( @entity11 ) pursued claims against soldiers despite realising the allegations of abuse might have been ' untrue '			1
it comes after a public inquiry spent £ 31million exonerating @entity2 soldiers of claims they went they went on a killing and torture spree following a fierce battle in southern @entity6 in 2004			1
right is a picture of the aftermath of the @entity37 shown to the five - year @entity39 inquiry after five years of investigations , the @entity39 inquiry in december concluded there were some breaches of the @entity45 convention following the battle			1
but it also ruled allegations of murder and torture were based on ' deliberate lies , reckless speculation and ingrained hostility '			0
now the government is gearing up to sue law firms for millions of pounds in legal costs and calling for the @entity58 's chief lawyer , @entity29 , to be struck off			1
the @entity60 's dossier , seen by at least two sunday newspapers , accuses @entity58 and another law firm , @entity63 , of continuing to pursue the case even after evidence emerged that the allegations may be untrue			1
it suggests @entity58 had doubts about the credibility of its clients ' evidence as early as march 2013 but failed to withdraw the allegations for another 12 months , @entity67 of the @entity68 reported			0
that led investigators to take evidence from around 100 further witnesses , costing taxpayers an extra £ 780,000 , the paper reported the government 's dossier as saying			1
it is also alleged that @entity11 used a local ' agent ' to trawl @entity84 for potential victims , a breach of a ban on solicitors touting for business that brought hundreds of extra claims against the @entity91			1
the @entity94 - based law firm even continued to represent one claimant in a separate judicial review after he admitted to @entity39 investigators he had lied about his sister dying on the battlefield , the dossier alleges			1
@entity63 are accused of failing to disclose a key document for six years , according to the @entity101 on sunday			0
thorough investigation : @entity2 soldiers with an @entity6 detainee following the @entity37 in may 2004			2
claims troops rounded up civilians for a killing and torture spree following the battle were dismissed the claims came after the @entity37 on may 14 2004 , a fierce firefight which erupted when insurgents from the @entity91 ambushed a patrol of @entity114			2
their reinforcements , the 1st battalion of the @entity116 , were also ambushed and after three hours of fighting 28 @entity6 fighters had been killed			0
claims which subsequently emerged that enraged @entity2 soldiers had tortured and executed innocent local people in the aftermath of the battle were dismissed by the @entity125 inquiry , which was named for an alleged teenage victim			1
former 1st battalion the @entity116 corporal @entity127 has previously told the @entity129 he felt he and his colleagues who fought in thad ' done the right thing '			0
mr @entity127 , 34 , who was awarded the @entity132 for his role in the battle , according to the paper , said : ' we have been dragged through five years of hell			0
that in my view is a betrayal of our service			0
' we did what we had to do as soldiers and we did the right thing			2
' @entity144 , 50 , the mother of soldier @entity145 , told the paper her son was ' upset and disturbed ' following the inquiry			2
' to be accused of wrongdoing in the aftermath of what happened is disgraceful , ' she said			0
@entity152 : the @entity155 checkpoint , near where insurgents from the @entity91 ambushed a patrol of @entity114 , then their reinforcements , leading to a fierce firefight sir @entity160 , the retired judge who led the @entity39 inquiry , did find that there had been instances of ill - treatment during ' tactical questioning ' of the detainees at @entity167 , near @entity168 in southern @entity6 , on the night of may 14/15			1
these included depriving the prisoners of sight , food and sleep , and using threatening interrogation techniques contrary to the @entity175			0
it amounted to ill - treatment and fell below the high standard to be expected of the @entity179 , sir @entity160 said			0
after sir @entity160 's report , @entity11 insisted the inquiry had been ' legally necessary , morally justified and politically required '			2
responding to a request for comment on the allegations against @entity58 and @entity63 , an @entity60 spokesman told @entity186 : ' the @entity60 is assisting the @entity187 , which is investigating issues that came to light as a result of the @entity190			2
' @entity11 said last night in a statement seen by the @entity68 : ' the @entity39 inquiry thoroughly investigated the subject of these matters during which no criticisms were made of @entity11 or @entity29 by the chair			1
' ' it is not appropriate to comment any further while @entity187 proceedings are ongoing			0
' @entity58 and mr @entity29 are confident that they have acted in accordance with their professional obligations			0

@entity39 inquiry spent £ 31million *probing* the claims against soldiers
government claims lawyers pursued claims they knew were made up
dossier alleges they used local ' agent ' to trawl @entity84 for new claimants
as a result the inquiry was *prolonged* for an extra year , the @entity60 claims
government lawyers may sue law firms for millions in legal costs
