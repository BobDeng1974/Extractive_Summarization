by @entity0 published : 21:08 est , 10 november 2013 @entity2 : 21:08 est , 10 november 2013 the procedure could instantly remove the need for traditional treatment , as seen above			1
( picture posed by model ) women with breast cancer could soon be offered ‘ one - stop ’ radiotherapy – sparing them six weeks of exhausting treatment			1
thousands could benefit from the radiation technique , which can be carried out at the same time as the cancerous lump is removed			0
while the patient is still under anaesthetic , a blast of ‘ gentle ’ x-rays is used to destroy any remaining tumour cells at the cancer site			1
the 30 - minute procedure , known as targeted intraoperative radiotherapy , instantly removes the need for weeks of the conventional treatment			1
a trial published today found it was as effective and safe as traditional radiotherapy			0
last night it was described as ‘ very encouraging ’ by the charity @entity28			2
at present , conventional radiotherapy is offered to all women who have breast - conserving surgery , where just the lump is removed rather than the whole breast			2
each year in the @entity34 30,000 women with early breast cancer have a lump removed and as many as 22,000 could be eligible for the single - shot technique			0
conventional radiotherapy , which irradiates the whole breast , requires 22 hospital visits spread over five to six weeks , to reduce side effects such as tissue shrinkage			2
but a trial of breast cancer patients in 33 different centres comparing the old and new methods found they were as good as each other			0
findings from the @entity50 trial , published in @entity52 medical journal , show intra-operative radiotherapy has a comparable recurrence rate , of around 1 per cent , and a reduction in side effects			0
deaths from other causes including heart disease were significantly fewer in the group having one - stop treatment			2
radiotherapy involves using high - energy rays to destroy any remaining cancer cells to try to prevent the illness returning			1
most women have their first dose of radiotherapy , lasting between ten and 15 minutes , one month after surgery			0
the success of a trial could see a change in @entity75 policy , doctors have claimed they then have the treatment daily from monday to friday , with a rest at the weekend , for about three weeks			1
it can be an unpleasant ordeal and women have to lie in a room on their own while a machine directs the rays to their breast			0
although it is n’t painful , it can cause unpleasant side effects including sickness , tiredness and soreness of the skin which last a few days			0
studies show that radiotherapy is highly effective and it has been found to reduce the chance of cancer coming back by 40 per cent			0
the trial , led by professor @entity97 and professor @entity98 , of @entity99 , has involved almost 3,500 patients since 1998			0
it compared outcomes for women given one - stop radiotherapy with those having the conventional form			2
overall , four out of five women having one - stop radiotherapy needed no additional @entity108 said : ‘ we are hoping the publication of the trial results will lead directly to changes in @entity75 practice			1
‘ many women will be spared six weeks of treatment going back and forth to the radiotherapy centre			1
’ widespread @entity75 use could save around £ 15million because it would slash waiting lists for radiotherapy , according to the researchers ’ estimates			1
it will be evaluated by the @entity123 next year for use on the @entity75			0
but it is already available in private hospitals in @entity127 , and at least two @entity75 hospitals , said @entity97 , adding : ‘ it has taken off in @entity130 and the @entity131 but @entity34 … is lagging behind			1

‘ @entity134 ’ x-rays is used to destroy any remaining tumour cells
30 - min procedure removes need for weeks of the conventional treatment .
results of a trial could see *wholesale* change in @entity75 practice
