by @entity0 published : 09:33 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 12:45 est , 12 november 2012 the @entity1 and the royal estate have come under attack from campaigners after advertising for cleaners at @entity6 78p below the recommended livable wage			1
this week is @entity8 and comes just weeks after @entity10 leader @entity9 set out his party 's agenda for ensuring employers pay a wage that meets the cost of living			1
campaigners want to see employees paid at least £ 7.45 per hour outside of @entity18 and £ 8.55 in the capital			2
however , an advert recently published on the @entity22 website is offering £ 6.67 per hour			1
bad example : @entity22 has said it is now reviewing its policies on wages following criticism from campaigners over a part - time role advertised below the recommended living wage the role is paid just 47p above the national minimum wage - a salary equivalent to £ 13,000 per year			1

' he told the @entity44			0
' since the @entity1 receives considerable support from the public purse she should pay a living wage , not just barely a minimum wage			1
' she 's setting a bad example to other employers			1
@entity6 is one of the 12 most affluent boroughs in the country , so you would anticipate the cost of living would be much higher			0
' i would hate to see a return to the @entity59 days where a privileged elite preside over the unwashed masses and just pay the bare minimum			0
' the advert for a cleaner at @entity6 was offering just £ 6.67 per hour a spokesperson for @entity66 told @entity67 : ' it 's shocking that in this day and age these sorts of jobs are still not taken seriously and still receive this kind of wage			0
' this particular example really points up the stark and glaring inequality in the whole system			1
' you have people on very low wages cleaning the houses of one of the richest families in the country , and these house bring millions of people to @entity86 every year			2
' it 's a situation that really needs to be dealt with and it should be obvious in this day and age			0
