@entity0 wo n’t have needed to make one particular phone call this week			1
his conversations with @entity3 and @entity4 tend to come when doubts enter his mind , but that does n’t quite apply after a win at @entity9			1
there is no need for the discussions he sought this summer after three of his leading players told him they wanted to leave			2
no need to ask what @entity3 and @entity4 would have done - as he occasionally does - but only after he has made his decision and put it into action			1
wins at @entity21 have a habit of helping confidence , especially when coming against a backdrop of criticism			1
‘ i pretty much guarantee that everyone in here did n’t give us a hope in hell before the game , ’ he said to the press after @entity28 ’s 2 - 1 win			1
he will , by declaration , ‘ work so hard that if i fail i will know i could have done no more ’			2
the club joker of the past decade is not smiling and is n’t breaking eye contact			2
in a room called the creche at the @entity57 , the @entity54 ’s youngest manager tells @entity58 : ‘ every day i am earning the right to be seen as a better manager			1
i want to earn the right to call myself a top manager			1
but i know this could be my only chance			2
’ moments later he yawns ; some club staff think he is working too hard			2
this is a 35 - year - old man feeling his way into a brutal trade , where the statistics he quotes say ‘ 50 per cent of first - time managers lose their job in the first year and 50 per cent of those wo n’t go on to manage again ’			1
it ’s a position he has spent years thinking about , but one he might never have reached if his back had n’t gone into spasm two seasons ago			2
‘ that was a big moment , ’ @entity0 says			1
joker : @entity35 shares a laugh with new @entity9 boss @entity81 at @entity21 on saturday he is trying to make sense of the events that led to him taking over from @entity85 in february			1
in august 2012 the @entity86 told @entity35 he was free to leave			1
the message was not delivered callously , but it set in motion a sequence of events that may have stopped @entity35 replacing @entity85			1
‘ i did n’t have conversations with @entity85 about leaving			2
i read it in the press			2
i did n’t want to go , definitely not			2
i was close to my 10th year here , we had gone through the divisions together			1
this is not just a club for me			2
‘ but i know how football works			0
a move to @entity101 was arranged and i ’m not sure people realise how close i was to going			0
‘ i was going to go that weekend but got a back spasm and did n’t train for three days			0
i told them i would be ready in two weeks , but they needed me immediately			0
it fell through , so i decided to work my nuts off and convince the manager he could rely on me			1
i ended up playing 15 games that season and the rest is history			2
’ it meant he was at the club and under serious consideration in february when @entity85 was sacked			0
in the opinion of chairman @entity117 , the club ’s principles were being ‘ eroded ’			0
captain : @entity35 , pictured in action against @entity122 in 2013 , first moved to @entity123 in 2004 from @entity124 @entity35 , a @entity125 since 2004 , stepped in as caretaker , several years ahead of schedule			1
he slept one hour a day in his first four days on the job and opened with a derby demolition of @entity130			2
they finished 12th and barring a week off in the summer with his partner , their young daughter and five - month - old twins , @entity35 has not stopped since @entity85 left			1
‘ it ’s been so hectic i ’ve barely had time to think , ’ he says			0
the early part of his summer was dominated by the fallout of talks with @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 , all of whom said they wanted to leave			0
‘ i wanted to keep them but they wanted different challenges , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ i made a decision that i only wanted players who really wanted to be here so i let them go			0
it ’s important here that players want to be part of this group			0
’ once the decisions were made , he phoned a couple of old @entity28 managers who help when they can			1
‘ i tend to act first , then call , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ @entity3 ( @entity160 ) and @entity161 ( @entity4 ) have been great			1
i [ do n’t ] just call up managers and ask what to do			0
i ’ll deal with it myself because i feel that is the way i ’ll learn			0
if i think i have done it right then great , but if i think i could have done it better i ’ll ask for advice , “ this is how i dealt with it			2
how would you deal with it ? " ‘ every mistake i have learnt from			0
i had chats with @entity3 about the situation with players leaving			1
i have asked about situations he and @entity161 had			2
but it was only after i did something myself - there is a lot to learn and often not much time			2
’ advice : @entity35 has learnt from former @entity28 managers @entity3 ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) @entity184 comes up frequently in this conversation			1
‘ i know how hard it is to stay in this business , ’ he says			0
‘ i know that as well as i get on with the board , they will not hesitate to do what is best for the club if we do n’t perform			0
‘ but if you manage by fear of that you ’re done			0
you have to keep learning until you are a good manager - you have to use your time well			1
i am in this job and now i have to work as hard as i can to learn fast and make it a success			0
‘ it ’s all happened very quickly			0
my thought process was to do my badges , carry on with the @entity203 and probably head into the academy and build myself up			0
‘ it was always my hope to manage this club but i thought it would be far into the future			0
it might not have come again , so do i stand up and be counted or lay down and die ? i have always stood up to be counted			0
’ with that , the man who made the ‘ £ 90million block ’ to stop @entity212 ’s shot in the 2011 play - off final against @entity214 is diving into his memory , from @entity54 to @entity219			1
huge achievement : @entity35 celebrates promotion to the @entity219 with @entity222 and @entity223 in 2011 ‘ people talk about what it was like when i first got here , but in 2012 we were a @entity219 club training at a health club			1
‘ you ’d come in thinking about playing @entity232 and in the shower you ’d have an 80 - year - old man next to you , asking what happened in the previous game			1
‘ it ’s part of our journey			0
we have top - class facilities now but when @entity85 joined his office was a cupboard under the stairs			1
he says management gained him 2,000 followers on @entity247 and that ‘ twins are easier to deal with than players because they do n’t answer back			0
they only care about getting fed and @entity250 ’			0
he sets aside an hour a night where he ignores his phone			0
‘ it is so hard to switch off but i try , ’ he says			0
the phone has buzzed three times in this interview			0
‘ after downtime at home there are always missed calls i struggle to return , ’ he says			0
‘ that ’s the job			0
’ if he has his way - and more results like at @entity21 - it will be his for a while yet .			1
