the @entity0 has today been accused of turning @entity1 into a ‘ joke ’ after footballer @entity3 compared voting for @entity4 to picking up ugly girls in a nightclub			1
in a heated exchange on the flagship political show the @entity8 midfielder told a newly elected female @entity11 her party was just the least unattractive option			1
to gasps from the audience , he told her : ‘ you won the election ? you won seats in the @entity20 that nobody really cares about '			2
‘ all you represent to me as @entity4 is the best of a bad bunch			1
if i ’m somewhere and there are four really ugly girls and i ’m thinking she is not the worst , that is all you represent to us			1
the ignorance that you spout it illustrates that footballers ’ brains are in their feet			2
’ mr @entity3 blamed his remarks on being nervous , saying he 'd prefer ' @entity54 and 87,000 any day of the week ' , but his performance has been called a ' new low ' for the show			1
viewers last night criticised the @entity0 for its choice of panellists - who also included former newspaper editor @entity60 - as mps from both sides of the political spectrum condemned the programme and @entity3 ’s joke			1
@entity36 , @entity67 mp for @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , tweeted : ‘ @entity71 has become a joke			2
’ and @entity73 , @entity75 ’s @entity74 , added : ‘ very unfortunate analogy there @entity3			1
’ making his point : @entity3 's first contribution was to say that the support for @entity4 was a protest vote indignant : @entity4 mep @entity43 , left , said that @entity3 's comment was ' offensive ' controversy : @entity3 's ' four ugly girls ' analogy did not go down well with the audience and on social media the top table : @entity3 was joined on the panel at @entity90 by @entity60 ( left ) another @entity92 user wrote : ‘ @entity93 has hit a new low with @entity3 on the panel			1
’ while one posted : ‘ @entity60 and @entity3 on @entity1 , wow it feels like some kind of @entity98 spin - off joke			1
’ an audience member later confronted @entity3 about his remark			1
saying : ' i was with you in some of the things you said ( but ) i think the analogy you made of four ugly girls , that 's going to be on @entity92 tonight and tomorrow , you 'll be buried for it			1
' @entity3 replied : ' i do apologise - i could n't think of a better one , this is the first time i have ever done it ( @entity1 )			1
' as @entity43 rightly pointed out my brains are in my feet , which is an equally offensive statement			1
' maybe i was a little bit nervous , i apologise			0
' afterwards @entity3 took to @entity92 , telling fellow panellist , former @entity116 editor @entity60 : ' i may have upset one or two women with an ill conceived metaphor			1
' he later added : ' should have left it at ' @entity121 ' ah well £ imnewtothis @ bbcquestiontime			0
' a @entity0 spokesman said : ' @entity3 was robustly challenged on his comments by both the panel and the audience			1
he apologised on the programme , putting his comment down to nerves			1
@entity1 often features journalists , comedians , campaigners and other public figures to add a different perspective to the panel			1
' @entity3 , who was called ' football 's philosopher king ' at the start of the show , is well known for holding court on political issues on @entity92			1
but he has a checkered history on and off the football pitch			0

its press office aired its frustration at not being including on the show – which last night had representatives from the conservatives , @entity75 and @entity4 - by tweeting : ‘ @ bbcquestiontime have refused to take a @entity155 panellist tonight			2
’ a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ @entity170 panel is chosen carefully across the series and the @entity155 party has appeared on every edition of @entity1 time in the last six weeks			1
‘ as with the other political parties , the @entity155 will again be invited to appear on the programme in the near future			0
