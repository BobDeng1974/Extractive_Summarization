after winning the @entity1 , @entity0 is heading back to the @entity2			1
two years after his acrimonious departure to @entity5 , the shutdown corner again showed his mastery of free agency , signing a vast five - year , $ 70million deal			1
with $ 39m guaranteed , @entity0 will pocket $ 16m - a - season in the first three years , @entity10 insider @entity9 reports			2
at 29 , the six - time pro bowler and four - time @entity12 is among a number of new additions as the @entity2 look to break their four - year spell without a play - off place			2
@entity0 defends @entity18 in the @entity20 's narrow 17 - 16 win over the @entity2 in december @entity0 lasted a year with the @entity21 after penning a six - year , $ 96m deal with no guaranteed money			1
the @entity20 moved swiftly following his release last year , with the parties agreeing on a $ 32m two - year deal			0
owner @entity27 declined to take up the $ 20m second - year option , opting to re-sign safety @entity29 on big money instead			1
the deal appears a questionable one for the @entity1 - winning @entity20			2
@entity0 and the recently released @entity33 gave them a secondary that was the envy of the @entity36			0
but they lose a locker room leader to an @entity40 rival and @entity41 has to rebuild his secondary once more			0
with $ 50m cap space , it has already been a busy free agency for @entity44 and new head coach @entity45			0
alongside the marquee signing of @entity48 , cornerback @entity46 joined from @entity49 , guard @entity50 comes in from @entity51 and linebacker @entity52 was re-signed .			0

@entity0 *rejoins* the @entity2 , the *franchise* who *exchanged* picks with @entity57 to move up and *draft* him 14th overall in the 2007
the shutdown corner left the @entity2 in bitter *circumstances* two years *ago* , joining @entity5
@entity0 won the @entity1 in his only year with @entity62 but heads back to @entity44 on big money
