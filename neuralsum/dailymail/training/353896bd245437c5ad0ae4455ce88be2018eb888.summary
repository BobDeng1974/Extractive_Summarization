by @entity1 reporter published : 14:56 est , 28 april 2013 updated : 13:47 est , 29 april 2013 clinical tests are currently being conducted on a new technique which involves removing the @entity5 virus from human dna and then allowing it to be destroyed naturally by the body 's immune system @entity10 scientists believe they are on the brink of finding a cure for @entity5 which could be used to treat millions of people with the @entity15 virus			1
clinical tests are currently being conducted on a new technique which involves removing the virus from human dna and then allowing it to be destroyed naturally by the body 's immune system			1
the scientists , based at @entity22 in @entity10 , say the possible cure would be affordable and would represent a dramatic step forward in the attempt to find a cure for the hiv virus which affects 33 million people worldwide			2
fifteen patients are currently taking part in the trials , and if they are found to have successfully been cured of @entity5 , the new technique will be tested on a wider scale			0
dr @entity33 , a senior researcher on the project , told @entity35 , he was ' almost certain ' scientists would be successful in releasing reservoirs of @entity5 to the surface of dna cells			1
he said : ' the challenge will be getting the patients ’ immune system to recognise the virus and destroy it			2
' this depends on the strength and sensitivity of individual immune systems			0
' the news comes just two days after the @entity51 government stopped trials of another experimental hiv vaccine after an independent review found it did not prevent @entity5 infection or reduce the amount of @entity5 in the blood			0
the study , called @entity59 , had enrolled 2,504 volunteers in 19 @entity51 cities			0
the vaccine was based on a common cold virus that was used to sneak @entity5 genes into the body and grab the attention of the immune system			1
with modern @entity5 treatment , a patient can expect to live an almost normal life , even into old age , with limited side effects			0
however , if medication is stopped , @entity5 reservoirs become active and start to produce more of the virus , meaning that symptoms can reappear within two weeks			0
a senior researcher has said he is ' almost certain ' scientists would be successful in releasing reservoirs of @entity5 to the surface of dna cells finding a cure would free a patient from the need to take continuous @entity5 medication , and save health services across the world billions of pounds			2
the technique used by the @entity10 scientists is also being researched in @entity90 , but studies have not yet moved on from the clinical trial stage			1
the @entity10 scientists were awarded £ 1.5 million by the @entity93 to pursue clinical trials on human subjects in january			1
the scientists are using drugs known as @entity99 inhibitors which are also used to treat some forms of cancer .			0
