by @entity0 vastly different species of sea microbes work together to respond as one to their surroundings as if they have one ' megamind ' , new research has revealed			1
@entity7 researchers have discovered communities of infinitesimal creatures in our oceans react in unison to changes in their environment			1
the links between them are not well understood , but findings suggest the creatures rely on each other to almost the same extent as the different cells in a human body			1
@entity23 : despite the amazing diversity of marine microbes , a new research paper shows that many different groups work together to react in unison to their surroundings as an example , if one set of the microbes were , say , creating energy through photosynthesis , which would then produce carbon dioxide , another set of microbes would somehow know and react - perhaps preparing to absorb the carbon dioxide			1
the open sea contains an amazing diversity of extremely tiny organisms called picoplankton , which include relatively simple life forms such as marine bacteria , as well as more complicated organisms			1
microbiologists who study wild marine microbes , as opposed to the lab - grown variety , face enormous challenges in getting a clear picture of the daily activities of their subjects			0
to take a look at these creatures in their natural habitat , researchers from the @entity55 and the @entity56 used a new method for collecting marine microbes			1
they created a robotic sampling device which dangled beneath the waves to collect samples of one billion microbes every four hours			0
similar to fast photography that stops action , the robotic device ' fixed ' each sample so that whatever genes the microbes were expressing at the moment of capture were preserved for later study			0
after returning the samples to the lab , researchers used cutting - edge analysis techniques to figure out which genes within the microbes were actively being used at different times of day			1
this involved sorting through millions of billions of fragments of genetic material and then assigning each fragment to a specific gene and a specific type of microbe			0
in so doing they created a time - lapse montage of the daily labours of a range of microbial species over a two - day period			1

using their robot microbe collecting device , researchers were able to gather samples of one billion microbes every four hours and keep them ' fixed ' at the moment of collection			2
this meant that whatever genes the microbes were expressing at the moment of capture were preserved for later study in the lab. microbes are extraordinarily sensitive to slight environmental changes , altering their gene expression rapidly in response to fluctuations in temperature , light , nutrient availability and other environmental variables			2
because of this , the genes they express tell a story about their habitat and their interactions with it			0
in essence , changes in their gene expression provide information on the good times and the bad times they experience			0
in a sense , each naturally occurring microbe is a living sensor and the researchers can read the sensors ’ outputs by studying their gene expression			2
by studying these environmental responses the @entity55 / @entity56 team were able to make completely new findings about the behaviour of the creatures			1
' but we have n’t been able to observe naturally occurring microbes with that kind of resolution until now			0
' professor @entity109 , who is lead author of a paper in the @entity160 detailing the research , added : ' we 've essentially captured a day in the life of these microbes			0
' as little as three years ago , i would n’t have even have considered it possible to get such a high resolution picture of microbial population dynamics and activity in the " real world "			0
' the montage showed photosynthetic microbes , which create the oxygen , energy and organic carbon used by the rest of the food web , ramped up their light - utilising activities in the morning and powered those down at night , just as their domestic brethren do in response to light and dark in the lab. but the underwater scenes also showed something scientists had never seen before			0
non-photosynthetic , carbon - eating microbes of very different species displayed synchronised , rapidly varying metabolic gene expression - despite the fact that they came from groups as different as humans and fungi			1
some of the genes simultaneously expressed by different species shared the same function — for instance , genes associated with growth or respiration			2
others encoded very different functions , mirroring the varied metabolic capabilities of the disparate species			2
' we 've essentially captured a day in the life of these microbes ' : researchers readying the robotic device connected to a buoy for its two - day sampling journey off the coast of @entity212 the researchers hypothesised that all these microbes were reacting to the same environmental changes , but that different groups of microbes were responding in different ways			1
although the researchers can not tell exactly which environmental changes the microbes were responding to , they suspect that the different groups of microbes were working together to obtain different types of food			1
for example , some picoplankton could have been consuming large organic compounds such as proteins and fats			2
in the process , they could have produced simpler organic compounds , such as amino acids , which were then released into the surrounding seawater and consumed by other picoplankton			0
' these results show a surprising amount of coordination between marine microbes , ' said a spokesman for the @entity56			0
' they also suggest that , as in the food webs of larger organisms , many different groups of marine microbes rely on each other to survive on a day - to - day basis			0
' this could help explain why so many species of marine microbes are difficult or impossible to grow by themselves in the lab. '			1

@entity7 researchers find that different forms of picoplankton react as one to environmental changes
although as different as humans and fungi , the creatures ' behaviour was linked
findings could help researchers understand why some species are impossible to grow in *isolation*
