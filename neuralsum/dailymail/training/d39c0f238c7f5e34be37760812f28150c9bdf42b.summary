by @entity0 a mother who was pregnant with twins has told of her heartache after she had to refuse life - saving treatment for one of them to save the other			1
nursery owner @entity7 , 30 , was pregnant with twin girls when one of the children in her care picked up slapped cheek syndrome			1
miss @entity7 did not realise how dangerous the virus is to unborn babies and after picking it up from the child , she passed it on to one of her unborn twins , @entity20			1
@entity7 , 30 , had to make the heart - breaking decision to turn down the offer of potentially lifesaving treatment for one of her twins so as to save the life of the other			1
she is pictured with the surviving baby , @entity31 ms @entity7 was told when she was 28 - weeks pregnant that baby @entity20 had died			1
both babies were delivered by c - section seven weeks later			0
ms @entity7 is pictured holding both of them a blood transfusion that could have saved @entity20 could also have killed @entity36 so she had to make the excruciating decision to refuse treatment			1
@entity20 died from the virus and miss @entity7 had to deliver her stillborn along with healthy @entity36			1
when @entity40 was delivered safely by caesarean section , miss @entity7 said it was ‘ bittersweet ’			1
she added : ‘ i had two babies but only one was coming home with me			0
' i had @entity36 in one arm and @entity20 in another , it was heartbreaking to see such a perfect baby who would never have a future			1
’ the virus , which causes a rash and cold - like symptoms , is considered fairly harmless in children			0
ms @entity7 ( pictured with @entity40 ) picked up slapped cheek syndrome when she was pregnant and the virus was passed onto baby @entity20			1
@entity20 could have been given a blood transfusion but this could have killed @entity36 miss @entity7 said : ‘ at 12 weeks during a routine check with my midwife , i mentioned that a child in my care had slapped cheek syndrome , i knew it could be caught through coughs and sneezes but i had no idea of the real danger it posed			1
’ she said her midwife was not unduly concerned			0
slapped cheek syndrome is a viral infection that is most common in children			1
it usually affects those aged between six and 10 and is most common in late winter and early spring			0
it causes a bright red rash on the cheeks as well as cold - like symptoms			0
in most cases , it is mild and clears up without treatment			0
the infection can be much more serious in some people - such as those with some blood disorders and pregnant women			0
in pregnant women it is only a problem if they are not already immune to it			2
in this case , it can cause miscarriage as the virus can cause the baby to develop severe anaemia			2
however , the overall risk of a miscarriage after developing the infection is thought to be less than five per cent			0
source : @entity95 some 60 per cent of adults are immune to the virus and even if a mother passes it on to a baby , usually there is only a 5 per cent risk of miscarriage			1
miss @entity7 was given a blood test and it was discovered she was not immune			1
however , at that stage nothing could be done as a vaccine would have to have been given before the pregnancy			0
the syndrome is caused by the parvovirus @entity109 , which can cause severe anaemia in a baby in the womb			2
miss @entity7 prayed the virus would not be passed on but at a 17 - week scan , it was discovered in one of the twins , @entity20			1
the virus can make a baby swell up with fluid , which it will eventually choke on			2
she said : ‘ i was then given two scenarios , either my baby would fight the infection or it would continue to fill up with fluid until the heart stopped			0
' to know that there was a child drowning inside of me was horrible			0
' i felt helpless in my own body as there was nothing i could do to save her			0
i just prayed they ’d both make it			0
’ by week 24 , @entity20 was critical			2
miss @entity7 , from @entity135 , @entity136 in south west @entity137 , said : ‘ i was offered a blood transfusion but because i was having twins it was too risky			1
‘ i could n’t risk losing @entity40 and doctors could n’t even guarantee that the transfusion would save @entity20			1
' i opted against it and trusted the doctors ’ advice			0
’ ms @entity7 ( pictured with @entity40 ) says she had to make the decision for the sake of her healthy baby ms @entity7 ( pictured with @entity40 and her other daughter , @entity149 ) says she had no idea of the dangers of slapped cheek syndrome and she is now trying to raise awareness of the risks ms @entity7 says the twins ' birth was a bittersweet experience because she was relieved @entity40 ( pictured ) was healthy but she was grieving for @entity20 miss @entity7 , who has a six - year - old daughter called @entity159 along with five - month - old @entity36 , said : ‘ they could n’t rule out that the virus would n’t attack @entity40 too , i was a nervous wreck for the next seven weeks			1
‘ i just prayed that my second baby would survive			0
sadly , i was told she had no heart beat at my 28 - week scan , i then had to carry both for another seven weeks			2
‘ i ’m extremely lucky i have @entity40 but that does n’t ease the pain of losing a child			2
i wish i had known the dangers of slapped cheek syndrome while pregnant			1
' i hope by sharing my story other parents will read about the devastating consequences the virus can have			0
’ miss @entity7 has now set up @entity177 in her baby ’s name to raise awareness of the risks of slapped cheek syndrome			1
around 4,000 babies are stillborn in the @entity184 each year			0
stillbirth refers to a foetus which dies in the womb sometime after 24 weeks of pregnancy , but before birth			2
there are several causes of stillbirth , including infections during pregnancy , pre-eclampsia , and congenital abnormality			0
it is most common to give birth naturally to a stillborn baby unless there are medical reasons for a caesarean and most women have to be induced			2
giving birth to a stillborn baby tends to take place withing two to three days of the death of the foetus in the womb			2
a devastating event , a mother and partner involved in a stillbirth should always receives psychiatric help before and after labour			0
