for most managers , losing your captain for three vital games - two against direct rivals - would be a disaster			0
but such is the embarrassment of attacking riches at @entity10 's disposal , he must now choose between a Â£ 37million @entity12 winner and arguably one of the best young players in @entity14 to replace the suspended @entity15			2
@entity16 no doubt would prefer to have @entity17 available for sunday 's clash with @entity19 but as far as replacements go @entity21 and @entity22 are n't too bad			1
@entity21 shows off his strength during @entity25 training earlier this week @entity22 takes a seat during a break in training earlier this week @entity15 is sent off during @entity25 's 2 - 1 win over @entity29 last week @entity15 ( centre ) took a full part in training last week but will miss the game against @entity19 most managers would love to have such options , but who will the @entity35 choose ? and what will it tell us about his long - term plans for @entity25 ? the @entity35 has already proven during his short tenure at @entity42 that he is not to be second guessed when it comes to team selection			1
he has , after all , used more players this year than any other manager and given debuts to several young players barely known outside the walls of @entity25 's @entity51 training ground			2
but @entity21 , having scored twice this season already , may consider himself a slight favourite over his younger rival , who is yet to start a game in any competition this season			2
@entity16 hinted as much during his friday press conference , saying : ' in [ @entity17 's ] position @entity21 has played very well			2
i will miss @entity15 because he is the captain of the team but @entity21 can also play very well			0
' that being said , however , the 26 - year - old has been on the bench for @entity25 's last two games - and did n't even come on during the 2 - 1 win over @entity29 last week			1
@entity10 will have to choose between @entity22 and @entity21 to replace @entity17 @entity21 celebrates coring against @entity66 in the @entity67 to give @entity25 a 1 - 0 lead @entity21 scores against for @entity25 in the 4 - 0 win over @entity70 at @entity42 last month with @entity71 and @entity72 - neither of whom are blessed with much pace - to start up front , @entity16 may decide that he wants more speed and dynamism in his front three - meaning @entity21 may be sacrificed			1
for all his talent on the ball and ability to open up defences , there is no doubt that @entity21 often slows @entity25 's play down			1
@entity22 , however , is one of those players who has the ability to get fans out of their seats with his direct style of play			0
under former manager @entity93 , the 19 - year - old was predominately seen terrorising opposition full - backs but many at @entity42 believe that he will eventually develop in to the no 10 role			0
@entity16 has used @entity22 sparingly this season but after he shone for @entity25 's @entity98 last week - scoring one and setting the other up - the @entity35 may feel he can no longer keep his @entity101 on the bench			1
in recent years , @entity25 have lost many of their promising young stars - @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 in particular - and that may too play a part in @entity16 's thinking			0
@entity22 skips mast @entity111 of @entity113 in @entity25 's @entity115 victory last week @entity25 's @entity117 players mob @entity22 after he scores the winning goal against @entity113 he must surely know that the longer he keeps @entity120 on the fringes of the first - team , the greater the chance he will leave			1
the @entity123 was one of the few players to emerge with any credit last season during @entity93 ' disastrous reign and it was expected that this would be the year he really broke through and showed his full potential			0
however , a change in formation and the arrival of a flurry of expensive stars at @entity42 have raised doubts about the future of @entity22			0
is he prepared to bide his time or will he look to move elsewhere in search of the game time a young player of his calibre no doubt deserves ? equally , should @entity21 find himself on the bench on sunday , then it would surely signal the start of the end for him at @entity25			1
if @entity21 is n't trusted in a home game against @entity19 , then when will he be trusted ? it is a straight shoot - out between two talented - but different - players and whoever gets the nod will be under pressure to deliver			0
but who will @entity16 choose , we will find out soon enough ...			0

@entity15 is suspended for @entity25 's game against @entity19
@entity160 is likely to choose between @entity21 and @entity22 to replace him
@entity35 hinted on friday that @entity21 is likely to start
@entity21 has been on the bench for @entity25 's last two games
@entity22 is yet to start a game in any competition for @entity25 this season
