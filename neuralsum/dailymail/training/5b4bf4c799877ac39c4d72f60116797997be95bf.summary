betting on high - stakes machines does cause harm by impairing players ' ability to make decisions , according to a report yesterday			1
academics tested a roulette - style game similar to controversial @entity8 ( @entity9 ) - and found that playing at higher stakes may fuel gambling problems			1
gamers who staked £ 20 were more likely to make poor decisions afterwards , such as continuing to gamble regardless of the consequences , than those gambling £ 2			0
@entity8 : gamers who staked £ 20 were more likely to make poor decisions afterwards , such as continuing to gamble regardless of the consequences , than those gambling £ 2 ( file picture ) the research is published in a long - awaited report funded by the major bookmakers , who promised to reveal the ‘ whole truth ’ about whether the betting machines are harmful			1
but the study does not recommend cutting the stake on what have been dubbed ‘ crack cocaine ’ machines			1
instead , the authors conclude that more research is needed in ‘ real gambling environments ’ to understand the full effects			0
campaigners branded the report , which has been handed to ministers , a whitewash as researchers were not asked to study actual @entity8 machines on which players can lose £ 100 per spin			1
the study is one of several published by the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) , an industry - funded charity			1
its chair @entity44 , the former boss of @entity46 , said in march last year : ‘ betting machines have long been blamed for problem gambling but that has never been backed up by evidence			1
‘ i have the backing of the @entity52 and the government			0
i want this study to deliver the whole truth			2
’ in one of the studies , which looks at the impact of how much people stake , @entity57 researchers asked 32 regular gamers to play virtual roulette with no money , £ 2 or £ 20			1
former @entity46 boss : @entity44 , chair of the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) , an industry - funded charity , said in march last year that he wanted the study to ' deliver the whole truth ' afterwards the participants did questionnaires designed to test their decision - making ability			1
those who had staked more , whether they won or lost , made more ‘ impulsive and poor quality decisions ’			0
the researchers said : ‘ it was demonstrated that gambling on a virtual roulette simulation at higher stakes impairs decision - making quality , which in turn may reduce self - control when gambling			1
’ problem gambling , they explain , is ‘ characterised by a lack of control and impaired decision - making performance , with a disregard for future negative consequences of gambling			2
’ they said the effects they saw may also be ‘ muted ’ by the fact players were not spending their own money , but were given it for the experiment , and could not choose the stake themselves			0
but they concluded that the study , which they said was carried out in a laboratory to control all the other variables , needed to be undertaken in a betting shop to understand the effects			0
@entity104 of the @entity105 , which calls for the stake on @entity107 to be slashed , said : ‘ whilst this research did not focus solely on @entity9 and why they are addictive , the one strand that is relevant to this debate clearly shows that the £ 100 stake is harmful			1
‘ if this type of research is necessary why was it not included in the initial study ? it is looking increasingly likely that the @entity42 is once again being used to try to kick this issue into the long grass			2
’ unimpressed : sir @entity122 ( above ) , the mayor of the @entity118 borough of @entity119 - which is also calling for curbs on the machines - said it was clear that the report ' only has the interests of the industry at its heart ' sir @entity122 , the mayor of the @entity118 borough of @entity119 - which is also calling for curbs on the machines - said : ‘ it is clear that this report only has the interests of the industry at its heart			2
' the £ 100 stake is harmful ' : campaigner @entity104 said it appeared the @entity42 was ' again being used to try to kick this issue into the long grass ' ‘ we were promised " the whole truth " about fixed odd betting terminals			1
' instead we have a half - hearted and woefully inadequate attempt which makes absolutely no concrete recommendations … to help problem gamblers , the communities they belong to or the nation ’s high streets			0
’ the @entity42 insist their report is ‘ world leading and independently conducted ’ and gives them a wealth of evidence which could help identify problem gamblers			0
they point to one of the other studies , by @entity153 social research , which looked at data on the behaviour of 4,000 gamers			0
the researchers were able identify problem gamblers using factors such as speed and duration of play , not just the stake			2
mr @entity44 said yesterday : ‘ the researchers have shown that it is possible to distinguish between problem and non-problem gaming machine play , and they have provided many important insights about player behaviour			0
‘ this research has huge potential to inform the industry ’s approach to minimising gambling - related harm and we strongly urge the industry to make every effort to improve how problem behaviour is more effectively monitored and managed in the future			2
’ there are 33,000 @entity8 machines across the country and they account for half of bookmakers profits			2
customers and betting shop managers have blamed them for fuelling gambling addiction			0
@entity188 , @entity189 ’s shadow sports minister , said : ‘ it is disappointing that this research can not tell us how levels of stakes and prizes impact on problem gamblers			0
this was promised by the prime minister and it is hugely embarrassing for him that it does not provide the information			0
