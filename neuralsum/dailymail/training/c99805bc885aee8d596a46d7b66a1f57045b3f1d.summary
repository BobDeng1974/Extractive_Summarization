@entity1 chiefs have insisted there is no possibility of the 2022 tournament being moved to a different country			1
@entity8 's @entity7 member @entity6 believes the @entity1 will be moved from @entity1 due to the extreme temperatures and the threat of legal action			1
@entity7 has always stressed the @entity1 will be in @entity1 but is currently looking at moving the dates to the winter to avoid the heat , and tournament organisers insist the only question is ' when ' it will be held in @entity1 and not ' if '			1
@entity17 says there is no chance of the @entity1 being moved to a different country @entity17 , executive director of communications for @entity1 's supreme committee for delivery & legacy , said in a statement : ' @entity1 will host the @entity25 in 2022 , despite comments of @entity27 member dr. @entity6 , which reflect his personal opinion and not that of @entity7			1
' the only question now is when , not if			0
summer or winter , we will be ready			0
we have proven that a @entity25 in @entity1 in the summer is possible with state - of - the - art cooling technology			2
' we have demonstrated that our cooling works in outdoor areas beyond stadiums			0
this summer we welcomed fans in @entity37 to an open - air @entity39 2014 @entity38 with temperatures cooled to a comfortable 22 degrees @entity41			0
@entity6 ( left ) does not believe it will be possible to have the @entity1 in @entity1 in 2022 ' the evolution of environmentally - friendly cooling technologies is an important legacy for our nation , region and for countries with similar climates - promising to expand the reach of hosting major sporting events to countries where it was never thought possible before			1
' @entity6 , who sits on @entity7 's all - powerful executive committee , believes the threat of legal action may force the @entity1 to be moved			1
he told @entity57 : ' i personally believe that in the end the @entity1 will not take place in @entity1			2
' medical experts say that they can not accept responsibility for a @entity1 taking place under these conditions			2
' they may be able to cool the stadiums but a @entity1 does not take place only there ( in the stadiums )			2
@entity6 believes the extreme hot weather will make it impossible for @entity7 to stage the tournament in @entity1 ' fans from all around the world will be coming and travelling in that heat and the first life - threatening case will trigger an investigation by a state prosecutor			1
' that is not something that @entity7 executive committee members will want to be responsible for			0
' no decision has yet been made on the timing of a winter @entity1 but there has already been opposition from leagues and clubs			0
meanwhile , a @entity90 mp who has campaigned for @entity7 reform has written to the @entity92 asking that it demands a copy of @entity7 ethics investigator @entity96 's report in the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity98			1
@entity96 ( left ) is said to be furious after @entity99 ( right ) said his report will stay private @entity101 believes the @entity92 has the right to be given a copy as it has previously investigated corruption allegations made by former @entity106 chairman @entity105			0
judge @entity107 , the @entity108 judge who is the head of the ethics committee 's adjudicatory panel , stated last week that the report 's contents would not be made public			0
@entity101 says in his letter to the @entity92 : ' i am writing to ask if you would request from @entity7 a copy of @entity96 's report			1
@entity7 seems to believe it is a self governing body that operates outside the jurisdiction of international and national law enforcement agencies			0
' i do not believe this is the case and that if they hold information that indicates that offences may have been committed this must be shared with the relevant law enforcement agencies			0

@entity1 due to host @entity1 in 2022
@entity7 member @entity6 believes the tournament will be moved
but this has been *rejected* by @entity1 communications director
@entity17 said that is only @entity6 's opinion
