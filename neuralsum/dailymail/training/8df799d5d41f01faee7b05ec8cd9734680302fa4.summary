common over-the - counter hayfever pills could raise your risk of @entity3 ’s , warn researchers			1
they found a link between dementia in older people and anticholinergic drugs , which include the antihistamines benadryl and @entity11 , as well as sleep remedy @entity12 and some older antidepressants			1
these medications affect the brain by blocking a key chemical messenger called acetylcholine , which has a range of functions in the body			0
popular hayfever pills such as @entity23 and @entity11 , sleep remedy @entity12 , @entity24 - which is used to treat an overactive bladder , and the antidepressant doxepin have all been linked to dementia the dementia risk is greatest when high doses are taken over several years , the @entity28 study found			1
many of the drugs are more commonly taken by older people , with up to half of the @entity35 ’s elderly population being prescribed at least one anticholinergic medication			0
study leader professor @entity37 , of the @entity38 , said no one should simply stop taking the drugs without speaking to their doctor			0
researchers found a link between anticholinergic medications and dementia			2
anticholinergic medications affect the brain by blocking a key chemical messenger called acetycholine , which has a range of functions in the body			0
people taking the following drugs for more than three years have an increased risk of dementia : for those taking the highest doses of these drugs , the risk of dementia was increased by 54 per cent after seven years , compared with no use			1
the risk of @entity3 's - the most common form of dementia - was increased by 63 per cent			1
but she said : ‘ healthcare providers should regularly review their older patients ’ drug regimens , including over-the - counter medications , to look for chances to use fewer anticholinergic medications at lower doses			2
’ research last year linked the use of anticholinergic drugs with mental impairment in the elderly			0
but the new study , in the journal @entity76 , is the first to show that the higher the dose , the higher the risk of dementia			2
researchers tracked 3,434 men and women aged 65 and over for around seven years while monitoring their use of anticholinergic drugs			0
of the total , 637 developed @entity3 ’s and 160 were affected by other forms of dementia			0
for those taking the biggest doses of anticholinergic drugs , the risk of dementia was 54 per cent higher than those using none			1
the risk of @entity3 ’s was 63 per cent higher			1
of the drugs named in the study , an increased risk of dementia was seen in people taking at least 10mg a day of the antidepressant doxepin , 4mg a day of diphenhydramine ( which is in @entity12 and @entity23 ) or 5mg a day of oxybutynin ( @entity24 ) for an overactive bladder for at least three years			1
many newer drugs to treat these conditions do not have anticholinergic effects , such as the antidepressant @entity103 and antihistamines such as loratadine ( @entity106 )			0
anticholinergic drugs block a chemical transmitter called acetylcholine , leading to side effects such as drowsiness and poor memory			0
people with alzheimer ’s disease are known to lack acetylcholine			0
dr @entity116 , of @entity117 , said more research was needed , adding : ‘ this large study adds to some existing evidence linking anticholinergic drugs to a small increased risk of dementia , but the results do n’t tell us that these drugs cause the condition			2
’ for people who took the highest doses of these drugs for the seven - year study period , the risk of dementia was increased by a statistically significant 54 per cent compared with no use			1
the risk of @entity3 's was raised by 63 per cent			2
