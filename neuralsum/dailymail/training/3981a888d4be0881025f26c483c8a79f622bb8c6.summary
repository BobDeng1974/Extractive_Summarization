president @entity0 pledged in the spring of 2013 to give back 5 per cent of his $ 400,000 salary in solidarity with federal government workers who were expected to lose an average of two weeks ' pay because of automatic budget cuts – known in @entity8 parlance as a ' sequester			1
' a year later , however , it 's not clear that he made good on his $ 20,000 promise			1
mr. and mrs. @entity14 's 2013 tax return , which the @entity15 published last month , shows an adjusted gross income of $ 481,098			1
the couple claimed $ 147,769 in itemized deductions , but no line - item for a $ 20,000 give - back to the @entity22 is anywhere to be found			1
@entity15 press secretary @entity23 reported on april 11 that the first family made $ 59,251 in deductible donations , and said that the largest such gift was $ 8,751 to the @entity27 , a network of ' comfort homes ' where family members of wounded warriors can stay while their loved ones are receiving medical treatment			0
they also deducted $ 42,383 in interest on their @entity37 home mortgage and another $ 29,176 in personal property taxes			2
but the @entity41 ' @entity40 , where they would likely deduct a salary rebate from their income for tax purposes , is silent on the matter			1
' the president has decided that to share in the sacrifice being made by public servants across the federal government that are affected by the sequester , he will contribute a portion of his salary back to the @entity22 , ' the @entity57 quoted an @entity14 administration official saying			1
since the salary of a @entity75 president is set by law and ca n't be altered , the official said , @entity14 planned to pay $ 20,000 to the @entity22 in equal installments beginning retroactively in march , and ending at the close of the fiscal year in september			1
those seven checks , then , would have been for $ 2,857.14 each			0
but there 's no evidence ink ever hit paper			0
the @entity84 first reported on the apparent conflict between what @entity14 said in 2013 and what he may have failed to do			2
neither that outlet nor @entity90 has been able to get the @entity15 to comment : emails from @entity90 were not returned , and a phone message went unanswered			0
it 's possible that @entity14 ultimately decided to wait until the furloughs actually materialized before putting his money where his surrogate 's mouth was			1
ultimately , the fears of career disruptions because of temporary layoffs were overblown			0
the online magazine @entity102 reported in august that nearly every major federal agency reduced or eliminated its furlough plans , choosing to cut elsewhere in order to save those jobs			0
@entity107 noted that many cabinet - level departments ' told @entity109 they would have to furlough employees , but ended up backtracking			2
' solidarity : as @entity14 was pledging to give up part of his salary in common cause with ordinary federal workers , the @entity112 was protesting threatened furloughs that never came ' @entity120 departments fall into this category , ' according to that report			1
' @entity124 departments all received authority to transfer funds between agency accounts , and were therefore able to cancel planned furloughs			0
the @entity129 projected furloughs at its @entity131 , only to cancel them in may			0
' the @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 all reported drastically cutting the number of furlough days as well			0
the net impact of furloughs on typical government employees , then , was far less than what was predicted when the president made his promise			2
it appears that so , too , was his symbolic financial contribution .			0

the president pledged a year *ago* to send $ 20,000 of his 2013 salary back to the *treasury* as a symbolic gesture to furloughed employees
most of the furloughs never materialized , and @entity14 's promised salary give - back may also have *dissolved* with the *passage* of time
the joint tax return he filed with the first lady shows no *indication* of a rebate to the @entity22 – something he would *logically* have deducted from his taxable income
federal law sets the president 's salary at $ 400,000 , making it *impossible* for the president to reduce his pay without writing a check for the balance
