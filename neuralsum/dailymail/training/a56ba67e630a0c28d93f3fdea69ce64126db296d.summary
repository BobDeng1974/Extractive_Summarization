by @entity0 @entity1 : 10:50 est , 15 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:09 est , 16 december 2013 there are ten characters at every staff @entity6 - and the ' kisser ' is the least popular of them all , according to new research			1
faces at work bashes may change over years but the 10 personality types - including the @entity12 - too - sooner , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 - are ever - present			1
every one of the millions of @entity20 office @entity6 parties will follow an almost formulaic pattern , and each one will feature their very own archetypal characters , says the study			2
a new stud says while faces may change over years , the @entity12 - too - sooner and @entity13 are ever - present almost seven in ten ( 69 per cent ) of those surveyed said the @entity27 is the biggest nuisance - and they do everything they can to avoid them			1
' we 've been hosting @entity6 staff parties for nearly 40 years at @entity34 and despite the changing fads and fashions , we 've seen just about everything in that time , ' says a spokesman for bar and brasserie chain @entity34 , who commissioned the report			2
' the faces may change as quickly as the music at these staff parties but one thing is constant - the 10 staff party characters who are present			1
' @entity50 is that more obvious than at the annual staff @entity6			2
these character traits seem common at every staff party we 've hosted since we were established in the 1970s			1
' we reckon everyone can name someone who fits each of these categories our experts have devised			2
and everyone has their own @entity27 - that one person who just wo n't take no for an answer and is determined to kiss every single person at the event			1
they 're the least popular person at every @entity6			2
' the @entity68 in their late - 30s or early 40s , ' happily ' married with children , still insists on wearing ultra-skinny jeans and is convinced that , despite their advancing years , they could still have their wicked way with any of the office bright young things at the drop of a hat			1
will be spotted stalking the office @entity6 bash like a shark on legs looking for stragglers			2
beware their slobbery chops , they come with their own horror movie soundtrack			0
the @entity12 - too - sooner this man or woman is the office @entity6 evangelist			1
they help round up the troops in advance of the annual bash and make wild promises of incredible party feats and promises of being the last - man or woman standing at the after - party shindig			1
unfortunately , they are then found just 90 minutes into the festive bash , candle well and truly burnt at both ends , snoozing quietly in the corner			0
the @entity103 thinks they could have their wicked way with the office bright young ( l ) and the flirt has made you the target of their inappropriate advances for the duration of the evening ( r ) the flirt you 've had your suspicions about this staff member all year and , as the @entity6 celebrations start to unfold , they confirm your worst fears - they 've made you the target of their inappropriate advances for the duration of the evening			1
they start off the night pleasantly enough - innocently offering to buy you a drink - but then suddenly turn , shunning every other member of staff and focus their attention solely on you ( or a particularly inappropriate part of your body )			1
they make lewd suggestions almost as an after - thought , sit uncomfortably close to you and growl at other members of their sex who have the misfortune of straying innocently into your vicinity throughout the evening			1
the @entity14 they 've been the picture of discretion all year , hiding their simmering discontent at not getting that pay - rise or failing in that promotion behind a facade of normality			1
but once the festive spirit takes them , their lips become loose and they begin to announce , at an inconsidered and raised volume , how rubbish it is working at their company			0
they also suddenly find it impossible to maintain company secrets or private disclosures			0
nothing is out of bounds and , before the end of the evening , any confidential company business is suddenly common knowledge among the entire workforce			0
often found at the root of any @entity6 squabbles			0
the @entity165 often best - friends with the @entity12 - too - sooner and the @entity167 , the @entity165 seems well up for plenty of festive frolics in the lead - up to the staff @entity6 do			1
they often go as far as helping organise venues for the hardy party animals to go to after the main event has subsided			1
unfortunately , this party ' type ' is usually never around when the after - party begins , having sloped off home for an early night and a mug of @entity180 discreetly while the rest of the workforce is still in full party mode			1
usually in their early 30s and often a new parent or horribly infatuated with their lover			0
the @entity188 quiet as a mouse all year round this pinstriped staff member suddenly , frighteningly finds their outrageous inner self at the @entity6			0
while they would n't say boo to a goose in normal office hours they suddenly think it is perfectly acceptable to go round helping themselves to colleagues ' drinks and dancing inappropriately close to members of the opposite sex			0
they 're also likely to announce that they used to be lead singer in a death metal band once they 'd quit their job as a dancer at a seedy revue bar			0
often to be found working the floor in tandem with @entity213			0
the @entity16 the @entity16 is irremovably welded to the side of their departmental boss you can easily spot this s ( h ) elfish staff member at the @entity6 because they are irremovably welded to the side of their departmental boss			0
they 'll be the one heartily laughing at their boss 's awful jokes , cooing cringefully at their boss 's development plan and happily skipping off to the bar and buying their boss drinks all night out of their own pocket			0
they 'll also be the one left looking heartbroken as their boss exits the party early without hearing their full 14 - part eulogy to their boss 's greatness , written in staggering techni - coloured fawning detail ( in their own blood )			1
often to be found at the end of the night in the toilets , attempting to outcry @entity243			0
the @entity243 the staff member who steadfastly , resolutely refuses to leave their personal problems at the door to the @entity6 venue			0
they wear their heart on their sleeve and spread their misty - eyed romantic delusions of love through snotty tear - stained tissues thrust into the clammy hands of colleagues unfortunate enough to aimlessly wander into the toilets while @entity243 is mid-shriek over the untimely ending of their torrid love affair with @entity260 , the butcher 's son			1
they cry so much and so often at @entity6 parties that @entity265 has stopped booking them a seat at the annual dinner table and has simply arranged for them to be hooked up to the water mains in order to replenish lost hydration			0
the dancer the dancer will bust all manner of old - skool moves at the office party always a decade beyond their prime , @entity278 will bust all manner of old - skool moves at the office party following years of secret attendance at their local community centre 's disco - dancing classes			1
thought you 'd seen the last of the hand - jive ? oh no you have n't			2
and you 've never ever seen anyone under the age of 25 attempt that backflip into a @entity293 strut before			0
this staff member will not vacate the dance floor - tonight it is their personal stage and the masses of open - mouthed colleagues sitting around the vicinity of the dance floor are their greatest audience			2
also available for christenings , bah mitzvahs and evening wedding receptions			0
the organiser woe betide anyone who decides to change their @entity6 dinner choice at the staff party or bemoans the quality of the venue , @entity265 will be firmly , angrily on your case			2
this diminutive staff member has spent years scaring the pants off the biggest characters in the staff canteen , honing their withering @entity320 stare to perfection			2
they have a list of everything ( including other lists ) and have arranged the staff party with military precision			1
no matter you have just ordered a full round of drinks for you and your colleagues , if @entity265 says it is time to move on , you move on			0
no argument , you shuffle into the dining room and leave your drinks behind ( they 're banned from this room because @entity265 has arranged special @entity6 cocktails to be served ) .			0

each party has 10 types including @entity12 - too - sooner , flirt and @entity14
seven in 10 of those asked said the @entity27 is the biggest nuisance
