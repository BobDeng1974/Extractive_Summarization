@entity0 and @entity1 are just like any other parents			1
they raise two young sons , go to weddings together and give each other parenting advice			2
however , there 's a catch ; because @entity1 is gay			2
the pair , like a rising number of people , are co-parents			0
co-parents are two people who want children but may not have found @entity14 or are n't able to have offspring themselves			1
@entity16 , 38 , was desperate to be a mother while she was young but had n't found mr @entity18 so she decided to became a co-parent with a gay man			1
here , she is pictured with their first son @entity21 , now 6 indeed , @entity16 was desperate to be a mother while she was young but had n't found mr @entity18 so she decided to do things her own way			1
@entity0 , 38 , who was born in @entity26 , but grew up in @entity27 and @entity28 , made the decision to co-parent with @entity1 , who also wanted children			1
speaking to @entity31 about her decision , @entity0 said : ' i had always known i wanted to be a mum			1
naturally growing up i expected to meet mr @entity18 , fall in love and build a family with him , unfortunately i do n’t have much luck when it comes to men			0
' when she was 26 , the former secondary school teacher tried online dating and introduction agencies			0
' i realised i ’d rather be a mum with no husband than wait for mr @entity18 and leave it too late to have children , ' she said			0
@entity0 met @entity1 - a homosexual man who wanted to be a father - on a donor site			1
she felt that @entity1 , pictured with their second son , @entity50 , shared her values and be involved in their children 's lives ' i applied for adoption in 2003			1
after a year of intense scrutiny i was turned down on account of being too young , too single and likely to get into a relationship ; that ’s when i decided to use a donor to conceive			0
' whilst i was trying to adopt i had read quite a lot about donor children , their feelings and experiences , about how not knowing their biological background affects their sense of identity			1
' this - in addition to my @entity71 background - makes it a big deal for me that a child have as much information as possible about their biological background and know their biological parents if at all possible			1
' @entity0 believes that artificial insemination works just as well as natural insemination			1
@entity0 gave birth to a @entity82 , pictured , now six			2
they also welcomed @entity50 , now two , and both sons are the light of their lives @entity0 then met 47 - year - old @entity1 - a homosexual man who wanted to be a father - on a donor site			1
she explained : ' i had been in touch with quite a number of possible donors but had n’t found someone who shared my values and who was happy to have his identity known or be involved in our children ’s lives			1
' i was at the point of giving up when i contacted @entity1 ; we both have a similar outlook to life and similar views on parenting			2
i was working overseas at the time so we had time to get to know each other properly via email for almost a year before eventually meeting up			0
' they opted for artificial insemination - a treatment for infertility , when a couple can not conceive a baby that involves directly inserting sperm into a woman 's womb			1
@entity0 believes that artificial insemination ( @entity119 ) works just as well as natural insemination ( @entity121 )			1
@entity0 gave birth to a @entity82 , now six			2
they also welcomed @entity50 , now two , and both sons are the light of their lives			0
the pair attend family functions together ; @entity1 was at her brother 's wedding last year , and is named on both sons ' birth certificates ' @entity1 and i are great friends , so much so this is the longest relationship i ’ve had with a man who is not a relative ! , ' she said			1
' our boys stay with me as we both agree we ’d rather they had a stable base			0
@entity1 sees the boys at least every other week and speaks to them on the phone at least once a week			1
whenever possible we do things together as a family such as going to a farm , or fair or live shows			0
' we also attend family functions together ; @entity1 was at my brother ’s wedding last year for instance			2
@entity1 is named on both their birth certificates and our children have both our surnames			1
' @entity0 's experience spurred a business venture and she launched @entity158 - a website for men and women looking for donor or fellow co-parents			1
speaking about her company , which charges a £ 150 registration fee and a further £ 395 for those seeking co-parents , she said : ' @entity158 is an introductions site for those seeking known sperm donors or co-parents			0
unlike other sites we do n’t have any profiles on our website and all members have to prove they are @entity174 tested , provide proof of identity and agree to background checks			0
' they also have to answer questions about their health and family			0
the aim is not just to introduce a recipient to any donor but to the right donor , to ensure people are being safe and asking the right questions before doing something that will no doubt impact their lives and those of any resultant children			2
' @entity0 used her experience to launch ' @entity193 - an introductions site for those seeking known sperm donors or co-parents @entity0 launched the site as a result of her experience trying to conceive as a single woman			2
after she was turned down for adoption , she turned to a fertility clinic and says there were quite a few things that did n’t sit well with her			0
' all their donors were anonymous			0
as a black woman i could only receive donation from a black donor ( and they only had two at the time )			0
plus , recipients were only given minimum information about their donors i.e. age , height , eye colour , hair colour , occupation and interests			0
' she continued : ' it was all so clinical , i had an @entity119 twice ( think cervical smear ) , not best for relaxation or conception			2
on top of these it was expensive , almost £ 3,000 per cycle ( £ 295 consultation , £ 295 tests , £ 1,600 ( two vials at £ 800 per vial of semen ) and £ 795 for the treatment itself			0
' i also tried donor sites and many were not moderated or monitored so anyone could join			0
my main concerns with these was that you never truly know if people are who they say they are , also it seemed no one was keeping track of who was donating to who			0
' there were requests for donors who were " available this weekend " or " in the next two days " - hardly any time to get to know each other or to get tested			0
' @entity158 is not nearly as popular as other donor sites but we meet the needs of a certain group of people not currently being catered for by fertility clinics or donor sites			2
' her clients are single women in their mid to late thirties , with good jobs , and lesbian couples who have been in a relationship for some time , as well as some single gay men in their 30s and older straight men in their 50s			0
' like me they all want to know who they are procreating with and be able to answer any questions their children may have in future , ' added @entity0			2
while @entity0 is still single and ' open to a relationship ' , now that she has the two sons she 'd always dreamed of , if she does n't meet anyone she says it ' would n’t bother her in the least ' .			1

@entity16 had n't found the right man but wanted children
wanted offspring to know their biological background and parents
@entity294 on donor site and shared same values
had two sons through artificial insemination ( @entity119 )
boys live with @entity0 and see @entity1 every other week
@entity0 has set up a business for people wanting the same as her
