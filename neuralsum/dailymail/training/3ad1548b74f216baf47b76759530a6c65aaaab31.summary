by @entity0 and @entity1 when @entity4 , a 34 - year - old former stripper from @entity5 began to go bald , his confidence was left in tatters			1
but while some would have put up with losing their locks , mr @entity4 , who now manages the @entity7 , plumped for an extreme solution - having , what looks like , new hair tattooed onto his head			1
' it involves a little bit of pain , a few snuffly moments and watery eyes but the end result is that i look like i ’ve got hair , ' he explains			2
big improvement : mr @entity4 chose to have his head tattooed after comb - overs and caps did n't work full head : mr @entity4 had a full head of hair during his stripping days and was devastated when it began to thin and eventually fell out ' i had four or five treatments but most people have two			1
i ’m very picky and that ’s the beauty of this treatment - you can dictate exactly how you want it			2
' mr @entity4 , who has managed the @entity7 stripper troupe for 14 years , had been left miserable and lacking confidence after noticing his hair beginning to thin			1
' i had gone completely bald on top , ' he remembers			0
' i did try to comb it over and cover it up			0
but it got to the point where there was nothing else i could do and i just had to shave it off			0
' for me there is nothing more soul destroying for a man than losing your hair - it ’s worse than going grey			0
' i first noticed it quite some years ago when someone at work said to me : “ you ’re losing your hair ” and i said : “ no i ’m not ” and he said “ yes you are ! ” ' ' it was a very slow process , ' he adds			0
' you start to get thinner and thinner up top and you notice clumps of hair on your pillow in the morning			0
' i started to wear more and more baseball caps			2
i was sat in the hairdressers one day and i was looking in the mirror and i just thought , “ it ’s time to shave it off "			0
' miserable about losing his hair , mr @entity4 resorted to baseball caps and comb - overs until bumping into a co-worker whose hair appeared to have mysteriously regrown			1
' one of the guys at work had it done , ' he explains			0
' i said to him , “ you ’ve done something done to your hair ” and he denied it and denied it but then he eventually told me he ’d been to have his head tattooed			2
gone : mr @entity4 says he found losing his hair deeply upsetting and had tried to cover it up by wearing caps ouch ! mr @entity4 immediately after having the procedure which he says does make your eyes water a little i was like , “ wow i really like it ” and went for a consultation at @entity90 and then i thought let ’s rock and roll ! ' like his colleague , mr @entity4 had opted for new treatment : a procedure called @entity95 or @entity96 which costs between £ 500 and £ 3000 and involves having tiny blobs of pigment dotted across the scalp to replicate the look of natural hair follicles			1
while not as natural as traditional hair transplants , according to fans , @entity96 is unnoticeable from a distance and can barely be seen close up			0
' the results are well worth the pain , ' adds a delighted mr @entity4			1
' you can add numbing cream and take paracetamol , but at the end of the day it ’s 12 hours of treatment for the rest of your life			1
he adds : ' one thing i would say is that it does make you sneeze a lot and your nose run [ during the treatment ] - it ’s like having hayfever			2
' improvement : mr @entity4 new hair line was created using @entity96 which involves tiny tattoos all over the scalp despite the pain and the sneezing , mr @entity4 says having his head tattooed has changed his life for the better			1
' i had gone completely bald on top but now it just looks like i ’ve shaved my head , ' says the @entity5			1
' i ’ve got that 5 o’clock shadow look			0
' he adds : ' i feel so much more confident now and i do n’t wear anywhere near as many baseball caps as i used to			0
' the biggest thing i ’ve noticed is people no longer say i ’m bald and if they ever do , i can now just tell them that i shave my head			1
