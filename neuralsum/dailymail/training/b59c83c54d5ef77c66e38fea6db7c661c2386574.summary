and starting on january 1 , he 's leaving his stores to his employees			1
the 70 - year - old community stalwart told the @entity31 that he was approached multiple times by large supermarket chains offering to buy his stores from him			0
though he could have turned a larger profit by selling to a chain , the store - owner said it would n’t be right not to share his wealth with those who had helped him the most			0
' my employees are largely responsible for any success i 've had , and they deserve to get some of the benefits of that , ' he told the paper			0
' you ca n't always take			0
you also have to give back			0
' beloved : mr @entity5 is a beacon in the community of @entity20 , @entity4 , offering aid to anyone he can great boss : an employee chats with mr @entity5 , who has owned the grocery stores for 45 years he said that his parents , who grew up in the @entity55 , taught him a motto that has shaped his life philosophy : ' do the right thing			1

he will begin transferring ownership of his three stores beginning january 1			1

the @entity68 allows the store 's employees to form a trust and contribute to it , letting profits go back into the community			1
@entity77 is another @entity79 grocery store that operates under this model			0
the idea was planted when mr @entity5 realized his four sons had no interest in taking over the family business			2

benefits : workers will receive possession of the stores through an employee stock ownership plan based on their salary and the length of time they have worked there family business : @entity5 first worked at the store in 1966 and later bought it from his brother community store : one of the three @entity103 's @entity102 in @entity20 , @entity4 mr @entity5 also suffers from @entity104 and was diagnosed in the 1990s			1

the real - life story of mr @entity5 ’s generosity echoes a @entity116 holiday classic , ' @entity117 , ' by famed director @entity118			1
the movie depicts @entity120 as @entity122 @entity121 , who sacrifices his dreams of traveling the world to ensure the dreams of others are realized			0
in one poignant scene , @entity121 and his new wife @entity127 give the money they had saved for their honeymoon to a local bank after there was a run on the money			0
reminiscent : the story echoes the @entity116 holiday classic , it 's a @entity138 , where @entity120 ( pictured center ) plays as @entity122 @entity121 while it ensured the bank 's future , it meant that the @entity143 would not be taking a honeymoon			1
