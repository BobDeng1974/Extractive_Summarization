@entity0 is mad and bad ? rubbish			1
this is a bold and clever decision and the right time for him to escape from @entity3			2
he can leave knowing he has done a good job in difficult circumstances			0
he did n’t win them a trophy			0
think of how decorated they all were as players , but they could not lift @entity3 to the heights their supporters demand			2
it is 45 years since @entity3 won a trophy , but @entity0 finished fifth in his best season in the @entity23 and consolidated their position , with a pretty average team and a club that sells its best players			1
@entity0 spent four turbulent years as @entity3 manager before leaving the club on monday club legend @entity13 spent two spells as @entity3 manager and narrowly missed out on the title last time it was @entity33 , next time it will be @entity35			1
there is only so much a man can take			0
he was manager of the month last month , having lifted @entity3 from the foot of the table with a six - game winning run , before losing 1 - 0 at @entity42 on november 29			1
since then , they have beaten leaders @entity44 — the only team to do so this season — but lost 1 - 0 at home to @entity49			0
it is typical of their frustrating , rollercoaster form			0
@entity0 was always a couple of wins from a crisis			2
former @entity3 managers sir @entity10 and @entity15 failed to bring silverware to the club @entity12 was only boss at @entity3 for a year and a half before leaving in the summer of 1998 @entity11 replaced @entity12 in the @entity3 dugout but only last a year in the hot seat at @entity62 the @entity3 fans created a ' sack @entity0 ' campaign which was at it 's strongest this season @entity0 made 128 league appearances between 1987 and 1991 , scoring eight goals			1
the highlight of his time at @entity69 , however , was the @entity70 run in the 1989 - 90 season			0
@entity0 was one of the ' @entity72 ' ( with @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 ) and scored the winner against @entity77 in that memorable 4 - 3 semi-final victory at @entity79 ( the other three also netted in that match )			1
the @entity81 pushed @entity82 all the way in the @entity85 final , drawing 3 - 3 in the first match , but lost 1 - 0 in the replay			1
@entity0 played every minute of both matches			1
two defeats and the ‘ @entity91 ’ brigade demand their say ; their banners ready to be unfurled again			0
‘ @entity0 is a @entity95 ’ one banner derided			2
he behaved with dignity and turned them around , but never really won them over			0
do not underestimate the lure of @entity100 for someone born in @entity102 — and the chance to return to a club where he is admired and respected and where he will feel supported			0
at @entity3 — potentially a powerhouse football club — @entity0 may have received an eight - year contract , but did he ever really feel like the man they wanted ? i ca n’t hear too many @entity3 fans complaining about his departure , but there are some in football who are questioning his motives			1
‘ why is he leaving a big club for a small club ? he must be crazy			0
’ the @entity3 fans wanted @entity0 out after a difficult start to the 2014 - 15 @entity23 campaign @entity0 played more than 100 games for @entity81 during a four - year spell at the south @entity100 club @entity0 back in his playing days scored a memorable winner over @entity77 in the @entity70 back in 1990 but , as a manager — and it ’s the same as a player — you know when your time is up			1
this is good timing for @entity0 and he is joining a good club			2
yes , @entity81 are a smaller club than @entity3 ( and they are 10 points worse off ) but he will revel in the freedom of a job where he can actually manage			1
@entity81 have been interested before , but this was the right time			2
yes , he faces a relegation battle but he enters a transfer window with an owner who will listen to his ideas			0
in the end , you go where you ’re wanted			0
@entity0 applauded the @entity3 home fans on sunday after the 3 - 2 win against @entity148 at @entity62			1
