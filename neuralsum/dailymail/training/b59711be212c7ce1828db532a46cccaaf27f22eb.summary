by @entity0 published : 09:54 est , 20 june 2013 updated : 10:07 est , 20 june 2013 a father who has the same birthday as his son was left stunned when his second child was born on exactly the same day again - at odds of 133,224 to one			1
@entity6 , 26 , now has no excuse for forgetting either @entity8 or @entity10 's birthdays because they were all born on june 8			1
@entity6 , from @entity12 , @entity13 , was amazed when he welcomed his first son @entity8 into the world exactly 24 years to the day since his own birth			1
@entity18 celebration : @entity6 , 26 , with his two sons @entity8 , aged two , right , and @entity10 on the day that he was born			1
all three celebrate their birthday on june 8 originally due at the end of may , the youngster actually arrived two weeks late but perfectly in time to share his father 's special day			2
having had a double celebration for the past two years , the 26 - year - old then went on to defy astounding odds and make the day a triple celebration after his second son @entity10 was born , like his father and brother , on june 8			1
dr @entity32 , at @entity33 , said the odds of two children being born with the same birthday as their father were 133,224 - 1			2
' if you assume these things are completely independent , then the probability that the father 's first son is born on the same day as him is one in 365 , ' he said			0
' the probability of his second son being born on the same day is again one in 365			0
you then have to multiply the two figures together to give you odds of 133,224 to one that all three are born on the same day			2
' birthday brothers : @entity8 , aged two years , holds his new baby brother @entity10			2
they were both born on the same day , june 8 father and son : @entity6 holds his newborn son @entity10			1
the father was expecting the baby to be born on june 6 , but he actually arrived two days late @entity6 said : ' having a child is a wonderful thing and i felt really blessed when @entity8 was born healthy and happy back in 2011			1
' the icing on the cake was the fact he came along on my birthday as it meant we would always be able to celebrate the day together			0
' unfortunately things did n't work out with @entity8 's mum but we have stayed in contact and are still really good friends , which means i see him regularly			0
' he has since found happiness with current partner @entity74 and the pair could barely believe it when baby @entity10 showed up on both @entity6 and @entity8 's birthday less than two weeks ago			1
happy family : @entity6 , his partner @entity74 , and their newborn baby @entity10 talking about receiving his second unexpected birthday present , @entity6 , who works night shifts at @entity86 , added : ' @entity10 was actually due on july 6 so myself and @entity74 never really thought there would be a chance of us all being born on the same day			1
' it seems @entity10 had other ideas though and he ended up coming four weeks prematurely on both @entity8 and my birthday			2
' we were both completely stunned and pretty much everyone who i have told since thinks i 'm joking or trying to wind them up because it 's so unbelievable			0
' after he was born , @entity10 suffered from jaundice and had to undergo a lot of tests before he was allowed to leave the hospital but now he is back at home and we 're enjoying every minute			0
' i could n't ask for anything more than to share my birthday with my two favourite boys			0
a day that was already special has become even more so now			0
it 's the best present in the world and more than i could ever ask for			0
' happy couple : @entity6 with his partner @entity74 who gave birth to his second child earlier this month			0

@entity6 and sons @entity8 , two , and baby @entity10 are born on june 8
odds of all three being born on the same day are 133,224 to one
