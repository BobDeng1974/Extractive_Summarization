car - free sundays could be introduced to central @entity1 , @entity0 suggested today , after being inspired by cycling alongside thousands of @entity2 in @entity3			1
the @entity1 mayor took part in a mass cycle alongside the recently - inaugurated president @entity7 on the latest stop of a high - profile six - day regional tour			2
every sunday , several main boulevards of @entity3 are closed to all traffic from 6am , allowing tens of thousands of @entity2 to pour into the streets on bikes and on foot , with street stalls and music offering a carnival atmosphere			1
' we have been thinking about it for ages - i do n't think you are going to get the @entity33 people out of bed at six in the morning to do it quite like that but it is certainly food for thought			0
' i will certainly be asking @entity39 ( @entity39 ) to dust down those old ideas and let 's have a look at them again			2
' i think it would probably take time to bed in and it would take a few years before people got into the swing of coming out into the streets and making use of the space that a car - free sunday provided			1
but it was very stimulating			0
' in a later interview with the @entity58 5 @entity57 's @entity56 , mr @entity0 said it would be important to look at the traffic implications and other logistics of such an event			1
for the past two years , several miles of central @entity1 streets have been closed on a saturday in august for the @entity66 event , a key event in cycling festival which also include the @entity69 100 mass participation and pro-cycling races			2
mr @entity0 , pictured , said he was ' blown away ' by the experience and said he would consider it for @entity1 hundreds of cyclists take to the streets of @entity3 , pictured , every sunday while the cars are banned @entity3 's event has been running for 16 years and become a weekly , rather than monthly , event when mr @entity7 was governor			1
since his meteoric rise to the presidency earlier this year , mr @entity7 has met only a handful of foreign leaders , including @entity84 prime minister @entity83 and @entity86 secretary of state @entity85			0
prime minister @entity87 had a brief encounter with the new president at the @entity91 meeting in @entity92 earlier this month			0
following the business breakfast , mr @entity0 said it had been a useful meeting			1
he said : ' we discussed co-operation in the financial sector , the investment @entity2 is hoping to attract from @entity33 and other @entity100 countries ... transport infrastructure			2
' we talked about the coming @entity102 and our experience in @entity1 of dealing with the @entity104 and the lessons of some of the ideas we could share about security , providing for the athletes ' village , which is always a very difficult issue			0
' all those sorts of things - exchanges of students , we are very keen to have more @entity2 students come and study in @entity1			1
we had a very wide wide - ranging discussion			0
' asked by the @entity58 if mr @entity7 had tips on ' fulfilling the dream of going from mayor to head of state ' , mr @entity0 laughed off the question and added : ' no.			2
. it was a very interesting conversation			0
' i think genuinely there is a real eagerness to see more investment from @entity33 but also to discover more about what @entity33 has to offer by way of trade and the opportunities for @entity2 to invest in our country			0
' that was the bulk of it			0
' mr @entity0 said he would raise the possibility of car - free sundays with @entity39 on his return			1

@entity0 said he was ' blown away ' by the *success* of car - free sunday
he *joined* @entity2 president and local governor on bike ride yesterday
@entity3 has banned cars from many streets on sundays for 16 years
thousands of @entity2 ride bicycles through the city on sundays
he said he would like to bring a similar car - free *scheme* to @entity1
mr @entity0 said he would talk to @entity39 about his plan
