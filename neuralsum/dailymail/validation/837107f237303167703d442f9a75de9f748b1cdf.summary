on the way home from @entity4 on monday night , the debate , as it turned out , was the wrong debate			1
should @entity5 have been sold to @entity6 last summer ? should he have celebrated his winning goal back in @entity8 ? both questions were irrelevant			1
@entity5 is an honest and talented footballer but he would n’t make a difference to @entity12 ’s @entity11			1
he is good without being really good			2
@entity5 shoots to score the winning goal against @entity11 on monday night at @entity4 a stranded @entity14 ( right ) looks on as the goalkeeper was beaten by former @entity11 player @entity5 @entity5 celebrated his goal against his former club as @entity6 won the @entity18 tie 2 - 1 @entity5 is swamped by his @entity6 team - mates on a night to forget for @entity11 supporters @entity11 manager @entity12 ( left ) and assistant @entity21 watch on during their latest defeat @entity5 , whose international record is better than his club record , scored a well - taken and well - anticipated goal on monday and celebrated appropriately			1
his overall performance , though , was modest			0
had he been playing in red rather than in blue and yellow , the result would not have been different			0
on tuesday @entity5 said : ‘ @entity11 is a club that means so much to me			1
i ’m a fan and it ’s hard to knock them out			0
i ’ll always respect the fans			0
i had a lovely reception and i ’m thankful for that			0
’ but @entity11 ’s problems under @entity37 go much deeper than any associated with his decision last august to sell a player he figured — with reason — would have been his fourth - choice centre forward			1
@entity37 cut a frustrated figure during the match as he and his team lost their last chance of a trophy @entity11 's ( left to right ) @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 look frustrated on the pitch tactical genius ? not quite			1
@entity12 received 3/10 for his tactics on monday night , but what about the players ? click here for full ratings the most telling moments of this @entity18 tie came in the second half			1
it was a close game at that point			0
@entity6 manager @entity62 will have been disappointed his team had conceded an equaliser so carelessly so soon after taking the lead but at half - time he appeared to tell his team to continue in the same vein			1
@entity37 , however , sniffed danger , or thought he did			0
he made two substitutions , neither of them positive , and that seemed indicative of a coach unsure of his players and unconvinced by his original plan			2
he did a similar thing at @entity77 recently and @entity11 lost that one , too			1
later , with @entity11 chasing in the wake of @entity5 ’s goal and @entity80 ’s sending - off , @entity37 pushed @entity47 — and , soon after , @entity81 — to the top of the @entity11 formation and asked them to feed off a diet of long balls pumped from their own half			1
@entity80 is sent off by referee @entity88 after the midfielder grabbed the official 's shirt @entity92 applauds the @entity11 supporters after being sent off for manhandling the referee during the tie @entity96 sits on the bench next to @entity98 as the on - loan striker went unused against @entity6 @entity37 issues instructions alongside @entity21 but their tactics and substitutions were questionable with their exit from the @entity18 against @entity6 , @entity11 's attention now rests solely on the @entity106			1
yet @entity11 have n't beaten a side currently in the top half since their home win against @entity110 in mid december last year			1
click here for the full story this is a valid tactic and one that worked at @entity115 last month			2
@entity47 , in particular , can be strangely effective in that role			0
nevertheless , while this was going on , @entity11 ’s @entity118 playmaker @entity98 and their @entity120 centre forward @entity96 sat in the dug - out			1
they were still there when an aimless hoof from @entity126 rolled out of play for a goal - kick and referee @entity88 signalled the end of the game			1
this , perhaps , is most damning			0
@entity37 ’s tactical preferences can be discussed all night long			2
@entity11 , whether they knew it or not , hired a pragmatist last summer and it is that side of the manager that the supporters are seeing now			1
more pertinent is the fact that one of @entity144 football ’s leading coaches decided — at the sharp end of a home cup tie that he knew his team must win — to put his trust in some @entity150 football rather than ask two players in whom his club has invested millions of pounds to go on and change the game through method and design			0
it is a strange state of affairs and one that tells us @entity37 has limited faith in his players			0
it also points to problems that will greatly affect @entity11 ’s transfer strategy this summer			1
@entity162 of @entity6 competes for the ball with @entity164 and @entity47 @entity37 knows he has to look for a new right back , central defender , holding midfielder and forward @entity37 's tactics have been questionable this season since he came to @entity11 as manager they ’re out of the @entity18 and @entity11 face the hardest run - in of the top - four hopefuls ... @entity173 : @entity115 ( h ) - march 14 , @entity174 ( a ) - march 21 , @entity110 ( h ) - april 4 , @entity175 ( a ) - april 11 , @entity176 ( h ) - april 18 , @entity177 ( h ) - april 26 , @entity178 ( a ) - may 2 , @entity77 ( h ) - may 9 , @entity11 ( a ) - may 16 , @entity179 ( h ) - may 24 @entity8 united @entity180 : @entity181 ( h ) - march 15 , @entity110 ( a ) - march 22 , @entity182 ( h ) - april 4 , @entity183 ( h ) - april 12 , @entity177 ( a ) - april 18 , @entity184 ( a ) - april 26 , @entity179 ( h ) - may 2 , @entity185 ( a ) - may 9 , @entity6 ( h ) - may 16 , @entity178 ( a ) - may 24 @entity110 @entity186 : @entity77 ( a ) - march 16 , @entity11 ( h ) - march 22 , @entity6 ( a ) - april 4 , @entity174 ( h ) - april 13 , @entity178 ( a ) - april 18 , @entity179 ( a ) - april 25 , @entity187 ( h ) - may 2 , @entity177 ( a ) - may 9 , @entity188 ( h ) - may 16 , @entity189 ( a ) - may 24 @entity181 6th : @entity11 ( a ) - march 15 , @entity190 ( h ) - march 21 , @entity175 ( a ) - april 5 , @entity182 ( h ) - april 11 , @entity174 ( a ) - april 19 , @entity191 ( a ) - april 25 , @entity183 ( h ) - may 2 , @entity189 ( a ) - may 9 , @entity178 ( h ) - may 16 , @entity184 ( a ) - may 24 @entity191 @entity192 : @entity177 ( a ) - march 15 , @entity175 ( h ) - march 21 , @entity184 ( a ) - april 4 , @entity178 ( h ) - april 11 , @entity189 ( a ) - april 18 , @entity181 ( h ) - april 25 , @entity176 ( a ) - may 2 , @entity190 ( a ) - may 9 , @entity182 ( h ) - may 16 , @entity183 ( a ) - may 24 @entity37 knows he needs a right back , central defender , holding midfielder and a centre forward			1
that is probably about £ 150million right there			0
the @entity200 coach also knows , however , that he needs to ease out some very big names to make that happen			0
@entity37 has to make decisions about @entity98 , @entity96 , @entity204 and @entity205 and that is before he addresses the issue of whether less glamorous types such as @entity126 , @entity81 and @entity209 are evergoing to mature into footballers good enough to help @entity11 back to the top of the @entity106			1
@entity37 has spoken many times about his squad lacking balance			0
what he has been understandably less candid about is the fact that it is just not good enough			0
there are problems with players such as @entity92 that need time and tactical tuning to address			0
there is , at least , no doubt about his quality			0
the cross he delivered for @entity49 to equalise on monday was evidence of that			2
@entity92 is not the issue			0
it is the supporting cast — such as @entity164 and @entity230 — that @entity37 remains unsure about			2
at @entity6 , @entity62 has his critics			2
his team remain skittish and unpredictable			0
nobody can accuse the @entity6 manager of not knowing his own mind , however			2
there is a methodical consistency about @entity62 that , for better or for worse , is clear from the way he chooses and sets up his teams			0
the same can not be said about @entity37			0
at the @entity11 training ground on wednesday , the increasingly irritable manager will be looking for something new , trying to find yet another way of turning water into wine before sunday ’s home game with @entity181			2
what is unclear though , is whether this constant changing of personnel and tactics tells us more about the limitations of the manager or the players			2
@entity6 applaud their travelling fans at the @entity4 after claiming victory over @entity11 @entity6 will feel the better of both sides as @entity11 continue to stumble in @entity37 's debut season in @entity260			1

@entity11 lost 2 - 1 against @entity6 to crash out of the @entity18
former @entity11 player @entity5 scored the winning goal at @entity4
@entity12 's tactics and decisions have looked unsure this season
@entity98 and @entity96 were unused substitutes on monday night
