his day job is to manufacture the parts that keep @entity5 drivers @entity3 and @entity6 at the top of the formula one world championship			2
but @entity10 ’s @entity9 will be sharing the headlines with them after putting the brakes on @entity14 ’s @entity13 hopes			1
@entity9 played alongside @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 in @entity19 ’s academy but was released at the age of 16 and thought his chance would never come again			1
former @entity19 academy player @entity9 celebrates after scoring against @entity14 the first of @entity9 ' two strikes at the @entity24 was from the penalty spot in the first half @entity9 ( centre ) celebrates with team - mates @entity28 and @entity30 after making it 1 - 0 from the spot however , the midfielder ’s textbook penalty and fantastic second - half finish made him the toast of @entity37 and football romantics everywhere last night			1
‘ words ca n’t describe it , this is the best moment of my career , ’ said a beaming @entity9			1
‘ for the penalty , i was so nervous and i knew the keeper who came on			2
he said to me : “ i know where you ’re going ” but obviously he dived to his right and i went down the middle			0
for the second , i could n’t have hit it any better			0
it was magical , that ’s the one word i can say			0
’ this was @entity10 ’s greatest moment since dumping @entity56 out way back in 1959			1
players and management celebrated like they ’d won the @entity13 in front of 3,220 jubilant travelling fans at the final whistle			0
but this was no plucky , backs - to - the - wall underdog story			2
the @entity65 outfit made a mockery of the 64 places that separated them from their @entity70 opponents , who famously lifted the @entity13 in 1987			0
although aided by @entity14 goalkeeper @entity73 ’s moment of madness — he kicked out at @entity28 and was shown a straight red card shortly before half - time — fearless @entity10 were excellent value for their place in tonight ’s second round draw			1
@entity10 's first goal came after @entity14 goalkeeper @entity73 was sent off for kicking out referee mr @entity81 ushers @entity73 off the field after sending him off in the first half @entity10 goalkeeper @entity84 ( centre ) celebrates after saving a penalty from @entity87 ( left ) @entity14 manager @entity88 described his team ’s performance as ‘ embarrassing ’ and put it alongside their 1989 humbling at @entity91 as ‘ one of the worst results ’ in the club ’s history			1
they won a penalty shortly after falling behind but captain @entity87 saw it saved by @entity84			2
and although @entity87 ’s 81st - minute reply ensured a nail - biting finale — which included seven minutes of stoppage time that seemed like an eternity for the away fans — they never looked like scoring again			1
@entity10 boss @entity105 , who played 536 times for the club , started another chapter in their history and rounded off a week he ’ll never forget			1
he said : ‘ it just caps a perfect week , my third daughter @entity112 was born last week and i have been up doing night feeds since then			0
‘ it is my proudest moment in a long association with @entity10 — payback for a long injury in the late nineties and some heartache when we lost our ground			2
we are still in exile but this makes it all worthwhile			0
’ @entity10 have been ground - sharing with @entity126 for 18 months after departing @entity127 , their home since 1905			1
@entity87 could have pulled one back for @entity14 , but fluffed his lines from 12 yards out @entity9 looked delight to grab his second of the match , which ultimately secured the win for @entity10 @entity14 's @entity134 ( left ) breaks away from the challenge of @entity30 during the game what 's caught my eye conference side @entity139 caused an upset when they dumped @entity143 out			1
former @entity145 trainee @entity144 scored the winner			2
@entity147 of the @entity148 came within two minutes of drawing with @entity149 , 61 places above them			0
@entity152 and @entity153 spared the @entity154 ’ blushes late on			0
@entity156 showed their promotion potential with a 5 - 0 thrashing of @entity159 and returned to the top of the @entity162 table			0
performance of the weekend conference outfit @entity166 ’s shock 2 - 1 win over @entity143 @entity168			0
@entity169 and @entity170 were @entity166 ’s heroes either side of @entity174 ’s penalty .			0
