by @entity0 published : 08:11 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 19:02 est , 4 february 2013 the future of @entity3 energy supply could be placed in @entity5 hands after a major setback for the government ’s nuclear plant building programme yesterday			2
@entity9 had been planning to build four plants with the @entity12 supplier @entity11 , but has now pulled out of the partnership			1
@entity11 will now try to rescue the multi-billion - pound scheme by casting around for a new partner , and is talking to the @entity16 , which is owned by the @entity5 government			2
changes : energy giant @entity9 has pulled out of a deal to build four news nuclear power plants , including next to the existing @entity23 development on the @entity25 coast if a deal went ahead , it would mean much of @entity3 ’s future nuclear power supply would be controlled by a consortium which is owned by the governments of @entity12 and @entity5			1
the building of nuclear power stations to replace existing ageing plants is central to @entity8 energy policy			0
without it , the country faces the prospect of a gap between energy demand and supply within 20 years and even possible blackouts			0
@entity9 , which owns @entity9 , was @entity3 ’s only energy company with the financial resources and expertise to invest in building new nuclear power stations			1
its decision to pull out was driven by concerns at the rise in costs following changes to regulations after @entity52 ’s @entity51 disaster in 2011			0
a deal with @entity11 would have given @entity9 a 20 per cent stake in two reactors at @entity56 , @entity57 and two at @entity23 , @entity25			1
withdrawal : @entity60 , chief executive of @entity9 , claims increased project costs and an extended construction timetable means they must pull out the company will now write off some £ 200million that was spent developing the proposal for the stations			1
while @entity9 will not be building new nuclear reactors , it still retains a 20 per cent stake in eight existing power stations , which are due for closure over the next 20 years			1
@entity9 chief executive @entity60 said : ‘ since our initial investment , the anticipated costs have increased and the construction timetable has extended by a number of years			1
‘ these factors , in particular the lengthening time frame for a return on the capital invested in a project of this scale , have led us to conclude that participation is not right for @entity9 and our shareholders			1
’ @entity9 is not alone in turning its back on new nuclear plants			1
last year , @entity89 power giants @entity90 and @entity91 abandoned plans to build reactors here			0
the uncertainty has been fuelled by questions over how to store the waste			0
@entity97 recently rejected a plan to store it underground and no alternatives have been identified			0
environmentalists believe the government should switch investment to alternatives , such as wind			0
however , building new wind farms is hugely expensive and reliant on subsidies through customers ’ bills			2
despite the setback , the @entity8 said it will press ahead with nuclear power			0
the @entity111 said : ‘ we are determined to make the @entity3 a leading global destination for investment in new nuclear , which will play a key role in our future energy mix. ‘ the decision by @entity9 reflects the company ’s investment priorities and is not a reflection on @entity3 government policy			2
’ @entity123 policy director , @entity122 , said : ‘ the @entity9 pull - out has exposed a very troubled @entity3 energy strategy			2
‘ this government ’s relentless focus on new nuclear has lost us years of investment in truly green energy and it now needs a @entity130 to deliver a clean , safe energy system – one that does n’t depend on deluded estimates of how much nuclear will get built			0
’ the @entity136 union said the only option is to nationalise nuclear power , bringing it under @entity3 control , rather than leaving it to the governments of @entity12 and @entity5 .			0

owner of @entity9 says projects are too expensive and will take too long
