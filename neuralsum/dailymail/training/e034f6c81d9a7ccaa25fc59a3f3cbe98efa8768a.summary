by @entity0 published : 04:57 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 05:50 est , 28 may 2013 it is the erotic thriller that set the record as the fastest - selling paperback of all time and sold over 70 million copies worldwide			2
no official copies were available in @entity7 though , where nobody dared to translate @entity9 assuming that it would immediately be banned by the censors			2
but there 's no stopping @entity9 and the book has become a hit anyway after being translated into @entity7 for the @entity15 market and the smuggled across to the mainland			2
best - seller : it may have sold over 70 million copies worldwide , but one @entity7 e-tailer is selling knock - off copies of @entity21 's @entity9 whilst one of @entity21 's novels sells for around £ 13 in @entity26 bookstore , @entity7 e-tailer , @entity22 is selling pirate copies of the whole trilogy for the same price			1
there are up to 400 booksellers advertising pirated copies on the site , and while they may look exactly the same as the originals these copies are actually printed in the city of @entity38 from contraband editions			1
speaking about the sensation , a spokesman for the @entity42 bookstore told @entity44 : ' not many people know about it yet			0
counterfeit : whilst one of @entity21 's novels sells for around £ 13 in @entity26 bookstore , one @entity7 e-tailer , @entity22 , is selling pirate copies of the whole trilogy for the same price ' there has been no publicity , so it is only a cult book at the moment			1
' most of the feedback we get is that it is very repetitive			0
' whilst sales are high , @entity7 social media is awash with mixed reviews and rated the novel 5.3 out of 10 because of its ' tedious style '			0
one such user gave her opinion of the book , writing : ' who would have thought that such a vulgar novel would be so popular all over the world , even breaking @entity70 's record ? ' i suppose nothing can compete with sex			0
' spot the difference : they may look exactly the same as the originals , but these copies are actually printed in @entity38 from smuggled editions in early 2012 , it was announced that there was professional interest in a film production of the @entity9 trilogy , which is hotly anticipated and still underway			1
the @entity85 producers @entity86 and @entity87 , who were hand - pick by @entity21 herself , will produce it and there have even been rumours that @entity93 is interested in directing the film .			0
