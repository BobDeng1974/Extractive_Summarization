by @entity0 and @entity1 the pancreatic cancer sufferer who sparked outrage for declaring in an advertising campaign ‘ i wish i had breast cancer ’ last night insisted : ‘ i meant it and still mean it			1
’ @entity9 , 25 , has been hit with hate messages since the provocative advert first appeared , including one from a @entity13 user wishing her dead			1
even tv presenter @entity14 , whose daughter died of breast cancer , denounced the campaign , saying it had made her feel ‘ almost sick ’			1
inflammatory : @entity9 , 25 , in the campaign for the pancreatic cancer ad but @entity9 is adamant she had no regrets about appearing in the shock campaign to raise awareness of pancreatic cancer , which has far lower survival rates than breast cancer			1
she said : ‘ i know i upset a lot of people by saying what i did , but it ’s true			0
if i had breast cancer rather than pancreatic cancer , it is almost certain i would n’t now be dying			1
instead i ’ve been told i ’ve only got four to five months to live			2
‘ hopefully the campaign will lead to more money being spent on research into pancreatic cancer			1
it wo n’t help me , but i hope it will mean others will have a better chance than i have			0
’ @entity9 ’s comments follow attacks by breast cancer campaigners , who say it is ‘ utterly misleading ’ to suggest breast cancer might be a more desirable form of the disease			1
@entity9 with fiance @entity49 in 2011 before the illness was diagnosed but the charity @entity51 defended its tactics , saying that while 85 per cent of breast cancer patients will survive for at least five years after their diagnosis , that figure falls to just three per cent for pancreatic cancer sufferers			1
@entity9 , one of three sufferers to appear in the campaign , said : ‘ i will never regret saying it publicly			2
i ’m not saying that breast cancer is easier to deal with			1
' but i wish i had it because i would have a fighting chance of survival			0
in the past couple of weeks , cancer lumps have grown on my head and in my breasts so i know i wo n’t be coming back from this			0
’ @entity9 said she plans to use the time she has left campaigning and is determined to marry her fiance @entity49 in may			2
@entity49 , 30 , who is now @entity9 ’s full - time carer , is sickened by vicious jibes at her on @entity13 and @entity75			2
one @entity13 user said they hoped @entity9 would n’t be in the three per cent of patients who survive			0
‘ it ’s a sick , sad thing to do , but we ’re just ignoring it and it wo n’t make any different to our support for the campaign , ’ said @entity79 ‘ i have always been proud of @entity9 and the way she has dealt with her illness			2
’ @entity9 began suffering from acute stomach pains in november 2012			0
it took five @entity90 visits spread over four months before doctors confirmed pancreatic cancer in february last year			1
in november , doctors told her to focus on palliative care rather than further treatment			0
she said : ‘ i ’ve received so much support from @entity51 so i did n’t hesitate when they asked me to join the campaign			0
’ shameful : it took five @entity90 visits over four months for doctors to diagnose @entity9 with pancreatic cancer @entity14 , who set up the @entity103 in memory of her daughter who died in 2004 , called the campaign ‘ very insensitive ’			1
she said : ‘ i feel almost sick when i read the words “ i wish i had breast cancer ”			1
‘ i watched my daughter battle breast cancer for seven years			2
at no time would she have said , ‘ ‘ i ’ve have preferred another form of cancer			0
’ ’ she did n’t want it at all			0
you ca n’t play one cancer against another			0
’ but @entity117 , @entity51 founder and survivor of the disease , defended the campaign , admitting she knew it would shock people – although she apologised to anyone who had been upset by it			0
she said : ‘ the words that have been used are how genuine people with pancreatic cancer feel			2
it ’s about raising awareness for a disease that gets little attention			0
’ @entity9 with @entity49 who has become her full time carer , left , and on the day she shaved her head for the first time every day in the @entity136 , 23 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and average life expectancy is less than six months			1
a spokeswoman for @entity51 added : ‘ we ’re all campaigning for the same cause – to improve everyone ’s chance of beating cancer			0
' we just have to shout that little bit louder to get heard			0
‘ we are trying to create a discussion and a debate to make people realise that when faced with a pancreatic cancer diagnosis and a survival rate of only three per cent , it is not unreasonable to wish for a significantly better chance of staying alive			1

@entity9 has been *bombarded* with hate messages since ad appeared
25 - year - old has since been told she has only four to five months to live
it took five @entity90 visits over four months for doctors to diagnose her
adamant that she had no regrets about appearing in shock campaign
pancreatic cancer has far lower survival rates than breast cancer
