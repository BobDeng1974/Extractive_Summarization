@entity1 , @entity2 couple @entity6 and @entity7 struggled to conceive and decided @entity10 was too *expensive*
instead they decided to adopt and the first shock came when the doctor told them the birth mother was *expecting* not one but three babies
then when the triplets were eight months old , @entity6 delivered twins , bringing their number of children from zero to five in less than a year
their tight - knit community is *pitching* in to help the busy family , *babysitting* and cooking meals
the family goes through 300 diapers a week , all so far have been donated
