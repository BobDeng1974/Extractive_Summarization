by @entity0 child porn : @entity2 was allowed to keep working as a teacher even after he was convicted of possessing indecent images of children a crackdown by @entity7 on paedophile teachers was unravelling last night after it emerged that 11 already cleared to return to classrooms will not have their cases reviewed			1
they include individuals who have downloaded child porn , one who kissed a pupil and another who allowed a teenager to drink alcohol			1
mr @entity7 announced that stricter guidance was to be issued to the teachers ’ professional conduct panel in an attempt to defuse a growing scandal			1
the @entity24 acted after it emerged that the panel allowed religious education teacher @entity2 , 36 , to continue working despite a caution for downloading sick child porn images			1
a senior @entity30 civil servant then approved the ruling			1
the guidance suggested that no teachers with child pornography offences would be able to work in a classroom again			1
but officials have admitted they are powerless to take action against anyone who has been through the process			1
it means the perverts are free to continue teaching , potentially bringing each one into contact with thousands of children			1
a @entity30 insider said : ‘ we ca n’t retrospectively change the guidance			1
the laws of natural justice and double jeopardy apply here , so old cases can not be resubmitted to the panel			1
' however , schools must carry out criminal records checks before they can hire someone , so if a teacher applied for a new job their record will come up			1
’ the source admitted that head teachers had the discretion to employ such individuals but insisted : ‘ in practice it ’s just not going to happen because no head is going to hire someone who has been convicted of possessing images of child abuse			1
’ @entity30 staff are checking records in an attempt to establish exactly how many perverts have slipped through the net			1
mr @entity7 said : ‘ the panel which makes these decisions was operating on guidance that was n’t fit for purpose			1
‘ we ’ve made it clear that if you are cautioned for viewing these sorts of horrific and indecent images , that should be taken into account			2
the panel should ensure that we do not have people who have been guilty of these sorts of crimes anywhere near children			2
’ egg on face : education secretary @entity7 had promised stricter guidance to ensure that no teachers convicted of possessing child pornography would be able to work in a classroom again the @entity30 confirmed that @entity2 is not working with children at present			1
the married father - of - four was working at @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100 , when he was arrested for downloading nearly 200 images			2
he was cautioned and placed on a ‘ barred list ’ by the @entity103 , although his name was taken off last june			2
from thursday 's @entity105 his case was heard by the @entity107 professional conduct panel , which concluded that he was not a risk to children and the @entity30 backed the decision			1
@entity113 , of the @entity114 in @entity115 , said he had ‘ zero ’ confidence in the government ’s ability to tackle child - related offences			2
‘ everyone is aghast at the failure to grasp the common sense that everything must be done to ensure that these people can never go near classrooms again , ’ he said			2
‘ they have n’t pinched a pen , they have accessed pictures of children being abused			2
‘ after @entity133 and all these inquiries we ’ve had , surely they need to take this a little more seriously ? ’ @entity137 and @entity137 were killed by their school caretaker @entity138 in @entity133 , @entity140 , in 2002			2
he had previously been accused of offences including rape , indecent assault and burglary			2
an inquiry that followed made recommendations to improve safety for schoolchildren			0

officers arrested him and sent a file to the @entity177 , but lawyers refused to charge him			0
however , a @entity30 disciplinary panel heard detailed evidence from both sides before ruling @entity171 had told the truth			0
at a hearing , the science teacher denied there was any affair when she was at @entity187 in @entity188 , but admitted having sex once at his house when the girl was 17 and no longer a pupil			0
@entity171 said that in december 2001 , they met outside school			0
@entity151 wore sunglasses and a hat to disguise himself and drove her to his house , with the girl lying down on the back seat of the car so no one could see her			0
@entity151 kissed her and she was said to be ‘ terrified because she had never kissed anyone before ’			0
they then lay naked in bed together but did n’t have sex , she said			0
