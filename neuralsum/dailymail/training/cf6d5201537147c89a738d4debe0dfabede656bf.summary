@entity6 ’s backhand is one of the reasons he is known as @entity6 — a comparison to @entity58 that is known to rankle him , curiously — but it was his serve , which reached 135mph , that did most the damage			1
he lost just 14 points off his deliveries all day , blasting a further 38 winners off his forehand and that single - handed backhand			2
