not @entity12 fashion blogger @entity11 , who googled her own name and discovered personal holiday photos of herself in swimwear being used on an @entity17 porn website			1
miss @entity11 - a 25 - year - old @entity18 who runs the popular style blog what i wore today ( wiwt.com ) , in which she and the site 's users post daily photographs of their outfits - said seeing the images made her feel ' annoyed ' and ' helpless '			1
@entity11 at the @entity28 on monday , left , and what she wore on 17 november speaking to @entity30 , miss @entity11 said : ' it 's one of the problems of having an unusual name : anyone can @entity2 you and find out so much about you			1
' the photos were n't being used in a pornographic way and they were n't even sexy images - just me in a cafe - but they were still on a porn website			2
it made me feel really powerless , and frightened for my reputation			0
' it 's not like it was a scorned ex-boyfriend and a sex tape , but when you 're trying to build a name for yourself online ...			2
i just did n't want people to think i was just another girl trying to get into topless modelling			0
' she added : ' my boyfriend at the time found it very funny , but i was really annoyed i felt really helpless			0
' and when the site jumped from the sixth page of search results to the first , miss @entity11 decided to put a stop to it , keen for people to know that she had n't put the photos there herself			1
what @entity11 wore on 4 november , left , and 30 november , right the influential blogger contacted the host company in @entity17 and the site was closed due to copyright infringement			1
' the tricky thing was that the photos were of me and i had n't taken them , so i did n't officially hold the copyright			0
' just because you 're in a photo , it does n't mean you own the copyright			0
i think a lot of young people do n't know that			0
' it 's difficult to fight for photos of you to be removed from sites - and that 's quite scary			2
' that 's the reason i always take the photos of myself on my blog ; so it 's obvious that the copyright for all the photos belongs to me			2
