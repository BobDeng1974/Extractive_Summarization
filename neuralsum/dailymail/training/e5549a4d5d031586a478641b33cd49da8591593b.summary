a @entity1 couple who were sued after refusing to allow a gay couple to stay in a double room at their seaside guesthouse will be legally allowed to turn away unmarried couples after becoming an non-profit organisation			1
@entity8 and @entity9 found themselves at the centre of an international furore after telling civil partners @entity13 and @entity15 that they could not share a room at the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , on account of their religious beliefs			1
but now they will be able to turn away unmarried gay and straight couples from the @entity27 , which doubles up as their home , after becoming a not - for - profit organisation			1
fined : @entity36 owners @entity8 and @entity9 , who were fined for breaching equality laws by refusing to let a gay couple share a room at their guesthouse , will be legally able to turn away unmarried couples after deciding to become a non-profit organisation guesthouse : the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , run by @entity8 and @entity9 mr and mrs @entity40 were forced to pay £ 3,600 to the couple in a landmark case in 2011 after they were found to have discriminated against them on the grounds of sexual orientation under @entity48 regulations			1
the couple insisted that their policy of not allowing unmarried couples to share a bed extended to heterosexual couples as well as homosexual pairs			1
the hotel is now to be turned into a respite care centre for @entity1 and anyone staying under their roof will now have to abide by the @entity9 's rules as long as they are set out in the company 's articles			1
the @entity40 have since taken their case to the @entity64 , where it was dismissed and have now had permission to have it heard in the country ’s highest court , the @entity67			1
mrs @entity40 , 69 , said the incident had changed their lives			1
she said : ' we have been through the mill since 2008			2
it has stepped up since the trial			2
' in 2010 , when the trial happened it was given a lot of press attention because it was a precedent and also dealt with quite a touchy subject			2
most people have quite strong feelings one way or another			2
' we are not fanatics			2
we have often been portrayed as being bigoted			2
controversy : the couple 's @entity36 will be reopened as a respite care centre for @entity1 ' i am not homophobic			1
i have no problem with them - i have always thought of them as people and enjoy their company			0
it is just that we thought it would be wrong for here			0
' it had nothing to do with homophobia			0
' all the way through we have always said no unmarried couples ; it just happens that homosexuals fit into that category ... it is a terribly difficult subject			0
' the @entity36 has been struggling to attract guests since the @entity106 was brought in 2007 , meaning they are no longer able to be rated by @entity107 because of their policies and therefore are unable to advertise in many of the guides that used to bring in the majority of their customers			0
ruling : @entity15 ( left ) and @entity114 outside @entity115 in 2011 after a judge ruled that they had been treated unlawfully mrs @entity40 says that the recession has added to financial difficulties and she has hope for the future			1
she added : ' we have come through two and a half years now and we are coming into a new chapter in that we are revamping this place and relaunching it			0
' not only have visitor numbers declined , but mrs @entity40 says that the couple have had death threats and sufferered vandalism			1
but she said that messages of support have far outweighed any negative correspondence since their day in court			0
she said : ' all we wanted was to be able to support marriage , to say no here			0
' this ( the result of the trial ) is the men ’s human rights and they come into a collision with our human rights			0
' nobody ever thought it through when this legislation was first brought in			0
' ca n’t somebody work out a formula that keeps them happy and us ? ' to try to encourage more people to stay , the @entity40 are trying to innovate			1
the first event they have planned is an educational supper on the @entity155 festival of @entity156 for @entity1 next friday			1
they will also be offering branch line breaks from june , where visitors will be offered guided tours of the five branch lines in @entity20			0
mrs @entity40 said she hoped it would attract rail enthusiasts			0
as for the legal battle , the @entity40 won permission in august to take their case to the @entity67 and their case is set to be heard on october 9 and 10			0
the bull 's appeal will be heard at the @entity67 in october .			0

@entity8 and @entity9 were fined in 2011 for breaching the @entity48
they refused to let a gay couple stay in the same room *due* to their beliefs
now they are to turn their guesthouse into a respite centre for @entity1
