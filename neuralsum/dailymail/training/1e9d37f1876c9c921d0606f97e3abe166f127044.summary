i thought it would be a good chance for @entity3 to play @entity4 in the deep role in the midfield diamond			1
@entity4 has been in good form for @entity10 and with his defensive quality and work - rate , he deserved a chance			1
@entity14 midfielder @entity4 got stuck in the middle during @entity17 qualifier against @entity18 @entity4 's touch map throughout the 5 - 0 win but he did n’t move the ball quickly enough through the middle			1
the diamond should free up @entity24 so you need to get the ball to him fast			2
@entity4 tended to go sideways when he should have run further with the ball and then tried to find men through the centre			1
he looked more comfortable playing in a wider role in the second half			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. playing a team like @entity18 poses a unique problem			1
despite a good show from their goalkeeper , the win was a foregone conclusion			0
but that mentality can affect performances			0
the only way to combat that is to play at pace			0
at times @entity14 did n’t do that enough but it did improve in the second half			1
@entity4 was far more comfortable playing on the flanks substitute @entity46 helped @entity14 step up a gear after the break against @entity18 @entity49 thrived in central role after coming on as second - half substitute @entity52 made a difference when @entity49 came on , he gave the @entity14 midfield a new dimension			1
he wants to play centrally but rarely gets the chance for @entity57			0
when he plays wide it ’s as if he has to prove himself whereas through the middle things come naturally to him			0
on thursday night he brought something extra and again showed @entity3 what he ’s capable of			0
@entity14 fans were delighted @entity63 got on the scoresheet against @entity18 since his move to @entity57 , @entity63 has enjoyed plenty of support and there was a similar reception at @entity70 on thursday night			1
the fans were willing him on and there was a real warmth when he scored			2
@entity14 will be relying on him in future , so it was good to see that			2
@entity76 debuts as @entity14 hit five			2

@entity4 did not move the ball quickly enough against @entity18
sub @entity49 gave @entity14 a new dimension
@entity14 fans were willing @entity63 to score at @entity70
