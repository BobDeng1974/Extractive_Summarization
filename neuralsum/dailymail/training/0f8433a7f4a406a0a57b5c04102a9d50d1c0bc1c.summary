@entity1 tycoon @entity0 has been told she must stand trial on drugs and violence charges that could see her jailed for up to ten years			1
the multi-millionaire wife of @entity8 founder @entity7 was arrested last year after allegedly performing a sex act on an unknown man in a @entity12 nightclub toilet cubicle while her husband watched			1

it is also claimed that she had two wraps of cocaine in her handbag , as well as drugs paraphernalia			0
strike a deal : @entity0 , 43 , ( left ) wife of @entity7 ( right ) was initially told she would avoid a prison sentence if she pleaded guilty it emerged last month that the @entity30 ' lawyers had brokered a provisional deal that would have allowed the mother of four to avoid trial , and any admission of guilt , in return for carrying out 100 hours of community service			1
but @entity12 prosecutors have performed a u-turn and @entity0 now faces trial			1
the change of approach was apparently sparked by growing concern within the state attorney 's office that the community service option was too lenient , given the charge of violence against a police officer			1
@entity0 was charged with battery of a police officer and possession of cocaine at an @entity17 club in august the dramatic turnaround will be a devastating blow to @entity0 and her 44 - year - old husband , who have an estimated £ 45million fortune			1
in a pre-christmas statement , she said : ' living under the shadow of this incident has placed our family under considerable strain , so i am very encouraged that a resolution has been agreed			0
' we fully agree with our lawyer and the state prosecutor 's office that this is the most suitable way to deal with the matter and look forward to agreeing the details in the @entity71			0
' but a @entity18 court source said yesterday : ' the pre- diversion programme was intended for first - time offenders not facing violence charges			0
' mrs @entity0 is charged with battery of a police officer and so was not deemed suitable to take part in the programme			2
the charges are too serious to be part of the programme			0
' @entity0 's lawyers are understood to be confused about the change of heart , given that prosecutors knew the severity of the charges before discussing the option of the pre-trial diversion scheme			1
last month , her @entity17 - based lawyer @entity88 began negotiating her planned acceptance onto the programme with prosecutors			2
the community service would have taken place in the @entity12 yesterday , mr @entity88 said : ' i 'm disappointed that the pre-trial diversion programme which was previously agreed upon is no longer moving forward			1
we will now commence a vigorous defence of this case and are confident of a successful outcome			0
' nights out : mrs @entity0 , second from left , and adult star @entity100 , second from right incident : the couple were arrested at the @entity104 in @entity17 , pictured , but the other man at the scene was released without charge @entity0 was arrested after allegedly being seen by an off - duty police officer carrying out the sex act in the club 's toilet			1

@entity0 , who lives with her husband in a £ 2million home in @entity144 , @entity145 , will have to go to @entity17 to face the charges			1
she also faces the potential embarrassment of full details of the case being revealed in court			0

a court date will be arranged for her to go on trial			0
' the @entity30 refused to comment			0
