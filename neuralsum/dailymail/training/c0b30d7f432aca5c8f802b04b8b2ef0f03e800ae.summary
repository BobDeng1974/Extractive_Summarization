by @entity0 a widow has spoken for the first time about the horrific death of her husband who was eaten by his friends after the party got lost at sea in bitter temperatures for nearly two months			1
@entity10 , 37 , said her life had been ruined by the terrible fate of @entity13 whose remains were found in the pitiless eastern reaches of @entity16			1
two members of the four - strong party survived the ordeal and , after carrying the head of 44 - year - old mr @entity21 through the wild , told police they had eaten the man from @entity25 after he froze to death			1
forensic analysis of mr @entity21 's body parts revealed that sections of flesh had been carefully sliced away while joints had been butchered			1
@entity13 's heartbroken wife @entity32 ( pictured on their wedding day ) said : ' i never expected such horror could come into my life ' after she learned what had happened to her spouse @entity32 ( pictured with daughter @entity40 and husband @entity13 ) says that her life has been totally ruined and that she only has a few remains of her partner speaking to @entity43 mrs @entity10 said : ' i never expected such horror could come into my life			1
it has ruined not just my life , but also the lives of all our relatives , and we are a big family			2
' can you imagine what i have left ? one foot with toes , one finger , and the back of his skull with some hair			2
this is all i have left from the man i loved			2
having just these remains , how can i say goodbye to him ? i have got almost nothing to cry over			2
' i ca n't think about it , i am losing my mind with this			2
' mrs @entity67 , who has a daughter @entity40 , 21 , is suing survivors @entity69 , 37 , and @entity71 , 35 , for emotional distress			1
she also wants a criminal prosecution brought against them			2
' i do n't want to suspect them of murder , this would be just too much , ' she added			2
' but i do want them to be punished for what they did , because it is just outrageous to leave it like this			2
' now i want these cannibals to be punished			2
i fear our police is not keen to investigate this case properly			0
' our law does not say a word about cannibalism , it is not a crime , so our two survivors can be punished only for defiling a body and perhaps leaving a human being in danger			1
' the ( police ) report did not leave me any hope , now i can be sure my husband @entity13 is dead and his body was found there in the taiga			1
' i am sure they have eaten him			0
now we know that @entity13 died somewhere else and they dragged the body all the way through the snow , eating it step by step			1
' but together with the remains of my husband there were also found the bones of animals			1
' if they could kill animals , why would they need to try eating a human body ? and why did they carry his head with them ? ' mr @entity21 set out with his friends from @entity127 village , @entity128 , on an epic fishing trip - of - a - lifetime to eastern @entity16 on august 8 last year			1
survivors @entity71 ( pictured ) and @entity69 are being sued for emotional distress by @entity10 after they admitted to eating him @entity32 and her daughter will have to live with the gruesome fact of how @entity13 died catastrophe struck early in to their trip when their jeep sunk in a frozen river leaving the party stranded in one of the most isolated spots in the world			1
all four took refuge in a remote hunting lodge , which they used as a base for a number of weeks , until they exhausted its food supplies			0
they did not seem in any rush to escape from the taiga , despite losing their fishing tackle and the vehicle , in which they had often slept			0
during this period they encountered a number of hunters who had vehicles and walkie - talkies			0
at least one let them use his satellite phone			0
as conditions worsened they began walking back to civilisation at the beginning of october			0
they left a note in a hunter 's house saying they had sheltered under the owner 's roof and eaten all his food			0
they also left 3,000 roubles – around £ 60			0
their progress back to civilisation was haphazard			0
had they been fit and properly equipped , they could have covered the distance in a matter of days , even with the snow and sub-zero temperatures			0
but it took almost seven weeks before two of them were found some nine miles from @entity127			0
in this time it is known all four took refuge in another empty hunter ’s shack near the @entity195 , an area described by locals as lonely and macabre			0
in recent years , seven dead bodies have been found there			0
they were found in the @entity200 by a @entity203 @entity202 rescue helicopter which saved their lives			0
@entity69 eventually confessed to the authorities that they had eaten mr @entity21			1
' he died by himself			0
only after that did we start eating him , ' @entity69 told @entity210 police in the @entity200			1
' at one point they were surviving on moss and sawdust			1
a lie detector test proves they were desperate , ' said one official			0
while he is now assisting investigators , @entity71 escaped first to @entity219 , then @entity220 , and then vanished altogether ten days ago , say reports			1
the other fisherman in the group @entity224 , 47 , has still not been found			0
survivors @entity69 and @entity226 ( pictured being rescued ) had been missing for nearly two months after their jeep sunk in a frozen river stranding the ice - fishing party in one of the most isolated spots in the world @entity71 , pictured , was kept alive for a week by eating his friend 's body before they were rescued			1
