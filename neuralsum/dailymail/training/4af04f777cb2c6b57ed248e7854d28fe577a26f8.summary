by @entity0 published : 08:10 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 08:44 est , 2 january 2014 an amateur photographer took these amazing shots of the clear night sky on a camera attached to telescopes from his back garden			1
the area known as the heart and soul nebula can be clearly seen in one photo glowing red in the dark sky , lit up by the surrounding stars			0
in other photos , the orion and scorpion nebula - invisible to the naked eye - can also be seen amongst the stars @entity20 , 59 , from @entity21 , @entity22 , installed two £ 3,000 observatories in his garden and attached cameras to the telescopes inside them			1
the cameras are mounted on special trackers which trace the movement of stars across the sky			0
@entity32 - inspiring : these pictures of the heart and soul nebula are made even more impressive by the fact an amateur astronomer took them from his back garden music of the spheres : the night sky above the impressive setup in mr @entity20 's @entity22 garden high technology : mr @entity20 installed two £ 3,000 observatories in his garden in order to indulge in his hobby sitting in the control room in his house , mr @entity20 , a professor in photonics at the @entity49 , remotely operates the four cameras on four different computer screens			1
sadly , mr @entity20 may not be able to take these extraordinary photos for much longer			1
a streetlight which lights up the garden currently uses sodium yellow lamp which does n’t affect his ability to take photos of the sky			1
however , @entity62 plan on changing the bulbs in the area with white led bulbs - and their stronger light at night means he can not use his observatories			1
the university professor remotely operates the four cameras on four different computer screens using a powerful computer in his home in his observatory , @entity20 has been working on a new technique for producing very wide - field deep - sky images			1
@entity74 is a view centred on the @entity76 in @entity77 and the objects on the right are in the @entity81 constellation @entity82 : this is the @entity84 that takes the wide field images			0
an electric motor and drive belt allow @entity20 to manually focus the lens			2
mission control : the control room setup in mr @entity20 's house			1
he only took up stargazing in 2002 when he brought his first telescope he said : ' if they go ahead with their plans to carry out the change i will have to move house			1
it ’s cheaper and can be turned down later at night but the telescopes wo n’t work in all the light			0
' he took the pictures at 10 - 15 minute intervals over four hours			0
he ’s able to clearly construct the outlines of the famous nebula in the sky and stitches the 16 - 20 images together using astronomical software - allowing him to create the crystal clear photos of the sky at night			1
@entity20 , the amateur astronomer who took the incredible pictures			2
however , he now fears new streetlights close to his home could derail his work mr @entity20 said : ' on the back of the telescope there is a camera which captures special exposures			1
' it sits on a mount and accurately tracks the moving stars while taking a series of photos			0
' an electric motor and drive belt allow me to carefully and manually focus the lens via a usb to my main house computer			0
' the mount moves the same way as the stars across the sky and takes sharp images at intervals to my choosing			0
' he only took up stargazing in 2002 when he brought his first telescope			0
two years later , he got his first observatory set up in his garden courtesy of @entity146 , a company in @entity147 selling astronomical accessories			2
the second one was set up two years ago and he ’s been taking photos of the night sky ever since			2
mr @entity20 added : ' the observatories are different because they contain different sets of telescopes			1
' one has a reflecting telescope and the other a refracting one			0
' i ’ve always been interested in astronomy but i only got my first telescope in 2002 , so i ’ve been doing it for 11 years now			0
' @entity161 with his homemade 70 - inch telescope despite being 93 million miles away , amateur astronomer @entity163 manages to capture stunning shots of the sun from his back garden			1
mr @entity163 , who works as a sales representative , installed a small observatory on the terrace of his house in @entity171			2
ever since he has used a humble dslr camera to capture breathtaking shots - including solar prominences , sunspots and even a plane crossing the face of the sun. @entity161 has taken a lifelong passion and turned it into a record - setting astronomical achievement			1
the long - haul trucker from @entity182 , @entity183 , has single - handedly built a 70 - inch telescope — the largest one on record to be crafted by an amateur astronomer , enabling users to see constellations previously visible only through the £ 1.5 billion @entity191			2
@entity161 bought the 900 - pound mirror — which was originally destined to go into space as part of a spy satellite until the edge of it was chipped during its manufacture — after it was auctioned off			0
an amateur astronomer has become the first person to capture a massive lightning strike ' into space ' above the @entity203			0
the atmospheric phenomena , known as sprites , had never been recorded in the @entity206 before an amateur astronomer in @entity208 managed to take the photographic first			0
@entity210 , 33 , spotted the sprite - caused by an upward lightning discharge five miles east of @entity214 - has sparked excitement in the scientific community with his image .			2

@entity20 took breathtaking images from two £ 3,000 observatories in back garden in @entity21 , @entity22
the cameras are remotely operated by the university professor from a control *hub* inside his home
he uses the impressive set - up to capture vast *starscapes* by creating a *composite* image from separate photos
but he could be forced to move house because of a new , *bright* streetlight set to be installed close to his home
