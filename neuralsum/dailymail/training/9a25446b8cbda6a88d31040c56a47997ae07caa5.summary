by @entity0 @entity1 has questioned the commitment of young players to the @entity5 football team , claiming there were certain individuals during his time at @entity9 who tried to find ways of skipping international duty			1
the @entity14 boss highlighted his experiences of managing @entity5 players while at @entity9 and recalled how some were very reluctant to represent their country			1
' i still think we go to tournaments , whether it be under - 17s , under - 19s , under - 21s , there are too many pull - outs , it seems to be everyone has got an excuse , and i can tell you when i was at @entity9 , when full internationals came around , there were two or three players who did not want to play for @entity5 , ' he told @entity34 's @entity33 programme			1
tough night : @entity35 and @entity36 look on dejected during @entity5 's @entity38 defeat to @entity39 doubts : @entity1 has questioned the commitment of young @entity43 players to the national team cause ' they would come to me 10 days before the game and say , " @entity49 , get me out of that game , i do n't want to play in that game "			1
' that was how it was			0
i 'd say , " you 're playing for your country , you should want to play "			0
' ' ( they would say ) ' nah , my girlfriend is having a baby in four weeks , i do n't want to play ' and that is the truth , so it makes you wonder			0
' and i think it 's only going to get worse			0
you see the stick the @entity5 players get and they come home , they 're earning fantastic money at their clubs , they 're all playing in the @entity70			2
' they think , " do we need the aggro ? " ' only going to get worse ? @entity1 believes more players will look to avoid playing for @entity5 in the future @entity75 , who won only eight @entity5 caps in his career , said @entity1 's revelation ' sticks a knife through your heart '			1
but @entity1 , who gave his backing to @entity83 , could offer no other explanation for @entity5 's failure to reach the knock - out stages as he described @entity87 as ' not a difficult group '			1
difficult to hear : @entity75 said @entity1 's comments ' sticks a knife through your heart ' he described the @entity94 and @entity39 teams who had knocked @entity5 out of the @entity38 as ' average ' and claimed @entity5 had more talent at their disposal than any other team in @entity87 @entity5 will fly home after playing @entity101 in their final group game on tuesday			1
@entity1 - once a strong contender for the @entity5 job only to see @entity83 picked ahead of him in 2012 - said he had been unimpressed by their opponents and could not understand how @entity5 had failed to deliver			1
' for @entity101 to top the group by beating @entity94 and @entity39 , that tells you all you need to know about the group , ' he added			0
' for me it 's the worst @entity94 team for years			0
@entity39 have two world - class strikers but then not too many players you 'd fancy in the @entity114 , let alone playing for your country			2
' we 've got good players , players who are good week - in , week - out in the @entity114			0
you look at half the other teams in the tournament and there are loads of players who come to the @entity114 and could n't get a game ... you know we 've got better players than them but for some reason with good manager after good manager , we just do n't get results			2
' asked about @entity134 chairman @entity133 's target of winning the @entity135 , @entity1 was dismissive			2
' good luck , ' he said			0
' are we kidding ? how are we going to go to @entity137 and win a @entity38 in heat we 'll struggle just to run around in ? not a prayer			0
