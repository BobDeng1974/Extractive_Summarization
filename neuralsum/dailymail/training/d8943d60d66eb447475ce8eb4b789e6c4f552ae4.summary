' @entity6 ' is affecting increasing numbers of eight to 18 - year - olds who spend extended periods of time hunched over a game or smartphone			1
the last time such a volume of problems was seen , was over 100 years ago when child labour was still common @entity31 and @entity32 said the last time such symptoms were observed was more than 100 years ago , when child labour was common in @entity36			1
