@entity0 has come under international fire with the revelation that the network has made a very unlikely , yet highly powerful , new foe - the city of @entity6			1
mayor @entity7 sat down for her first international interview since the @entity10 terrorist attack on tuesday , telling @entity11 that it was her intent to go after the polarizing news organization for ' attacking the honor and the image ' of the city in statements made in the wake of this tragedy			1
more specifically , the decision by the network to introduce the @entity22 myth that @entity6 , and most of @entity23 , had become filled with areas they referred to as ' no go zones , ' which were off limits to everyone but @entity29 - including police and government officials - and governed by @entity33 law			1
they ’ve even - and they ’ve not assimilated , they ’ve separated			0
' he then added ; ' they have no - go zones			0
if you ’re @entity58 , you ’re not allowed			0
not police , not even fire department if there ’s a fire			0
sharia courts have been allowed to be established			0
prayer rugs in just about every hotel			0
' just a few days later , @entity66 welcomed analyst @entity67 on her show , who said of these zones , believed by many to be entirely inaccurate from the start ; ' they ’re sort of amorphous , they ’re not contiguous necessarily , but they ’re sort of safe havens			2
' @entity67 then took the idea a step further by stating ; ' and they ’re places where the governments , like @entity45 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 — they do n’t exercise any sovereignty so you basically have zones where @entity33 courts are set up , where @entity51 density is very intense , where police do n’t go in			2
' finally , @entity67 wrapped the segment up by making the claim that @entity92 , @entity91 was an example of one of these zones , and that ' non-muslims just simply do n’t go in			1
' @entity0 ultimately issued corrections for these statements , as well as an apology			1
@entity51 myth : this in response to the network 's claim that @entity23 was filled with ' no go zones ' where non-muslims were not allowed , which was first introduced by @entity38 ( above ) too far : a guest of @entity66 's ( above ) show , @entity67 , even claimed that @entity92 , @entity91 was an example of a ' no go zone ' that , however , is not enough for mayor @entity7			1
' when we 're insulted , and when we 've had an image , then i think we 'll have to sue , i think we 'll have to go to court , in order to have these words removed , ' she told @entity119 's @entity11			0
' the image of @entity6 has been prejudiced , and the honor of @entity6 has been prejudiced			0
' @entity122 , the executive vice president of news at the network said in a statement ; ' we empathize with the citizens of @entity45 as they go through a healing process and return to everyday life			1
however , we find the mayor ’s comments regarding a lawsuit misplaced			2

in her first international interview in the wake of the @entity10 terrorist attack , @entity6 mayor @entity7 announced the city would sue @entity0
this as a result of the network 's @entity22 statements following the attack , and *repeated* claims of what they called ' no go zones ' in @entity23
these ' no go zones ' *banned* non-muslims they claimed , and were governed by @entity33 law
one analyst , @entity67 , even made the claim that @entity92 , @entity91 was a ' no go zone '
the network ultimately issued both a correction and an apology for their statements
@entity122 , executive vice president of news at the network , said in a statement that @entity7 's comments about a lawsuit were ' misplaced '
