@entity0 must be wondering what he has done to upset referees over the festive period			0
on @entity4 refused to send @entity6 ’s @entity5 off when he pulled @entity7 back when clean through on goal — @entity9 lost that game			2
then on sunday , with his @entity9 team a goal up , @entity11 clearly elbowed @entity14 twice while waiting for a corner to be taken			1
@entity16 forward @entity11 ( circled ) was lucky to stay on the pitch after elbowing @entity14 @entity14 holds his face after being hit with a elbow by @entity11 during @entity16 's win over @entity9 referee @entity22 appeared to be looking towards @entity11 but he must have looked away , twice , to have missed the clear violent act which should have resulted in a routine red card for @entity11 , who then scored @entity16 ’s equaliser			1
former @entity16 manager @entity26 said @entity14 might have broken his jaw			2
@entity28 added : ‘ it ’s the most certain red you will ever see			0
’ they were both right ! that moment proved to be the turning point as moments later @entity16 equalised through @entity11 's strike			0

@entity9 have not had much luck with referees over @entity*3*9
@entity22 should have sent @entity11 off on sunday
the @entity16 striker elbowed @entity14 twice
@entity9 lost *3* *-* 2 at @entity44 despite having taken the lead
