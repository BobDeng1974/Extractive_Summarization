@entity0 might have made enemies on celebrity @entity2 but it seems the outspoken star is intent on making a few more after branding @entity6 singer @entity5 ' chubby ' during a tv appearance			1
now the 32 - year - old singer has hit back , describing @entity0 ' words as ' harmful ' and saying the reality star is likely to leave a ' toxic and negative ' legacy			2
@entity12 was left fuming after 40 - year - old @entity0 ' appearance on @entity14 - in particular because she gave birth to her fourth child just five months ago			1
writing in a post on her @entity19 blog , @entity12 explained that she has focused on looking after her health since the birth and reacted with ' complete horror ' when she heard @entity0 ' remark			2
' it is pressure from women like @entity0 - who talk utter nonsense and define people by their looks and weight - who are responsible for this pressure , ' she fumed			2
@entity12 , who says her weight has been scrutinised since she was 20 , continued by saying she 's now old enough and confident enough to brush @entity0 ' ' idiotic comments ' aside			1
' if she feels it ’s justified to call me “ chubby ” , ' she continued , ' despite the fact i ’m a new mum and a size 8 , the woman is clearly very harmful and the less exposure she gets the better			1
' @entity55 , left , was speaking on @entity14 when she branded @entity5 , pictured , right , with new daughter @entity56 , and her band mates ' chubby ' unfortunately , added the @entity6 star , not every woman is so confident			1
' the sad reality is , there ’ll be other women , especially new mums , who will feel under pressure by her comments			0
' @entity12 also used her post to discuss her struggle with post-natal depression , sparked by the birth of her first child @entity72 in 2002			2
' my weight plummeted dramatically , ' she remembers , ' and i found it increasingly difficult to leave the house and go to work			0
' i knew there ’d be another weight related story that would be criticise me further			0
' @entity5 , pictured with her bandmates @entity33 and @entity34 , says she 's now old enough and confident enough in her own skin to brush @entity55 's ' idiotic comments ' aside twelve years on and @entity12 says she has learned to love herself and is teaching her children to love others whatever their shape or size			1
' i think @entity0 ’ fixation on berating people ’s looks masks her own insecurities , ' she concludes			0
' what ’s worse is that she is a mother			0
does she really believe her own children will be impervious to cruel jibes and insults - what a shame that her legacy will be so toxic and negative			0
' the spat came shortly after @entity12 showed off her incredible post-baby body during a performance with her @entity6 bandmates at @entity103 in @entity104 on saturday night			1
the 32 - year - old singer donned a daring pvc cut - out jumpsuit for the performance , which revealed a leather bra and matching pants			0
the girls were taking to the stage exactly 14 years to the day after they played their first @entity103 gig			0
@entity5 , left , in 2003 , says that twelve years on from giving birth to her first son in 2002 , explains that she has learned to love herself and is teaching her children to love other 's whatever their shape or size			1

@entity55 branded @entity6 ' chubby ' on @entity14 this week
size 8 @entity5 , who gave birth five months ago , says she 's ' very harmful '
@entity5 spoke *candidly* about weight struggles but says she 's happy now
