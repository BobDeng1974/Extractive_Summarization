deputy head : @entity1 , 46 , was found dead a day after police questioned him over allegations that he had purchased child pornography from abroad a paedophile deputy headmaster who secretly filmed his pupils may have been assessed as a ‘ low risk ’ by detectives , it was claimed today			1
@entity10 began probing allegations that @entity1 , of @entity12 in @entity13 , had bought material online which may have included images of naked teenage boys			1
mr @entity1 , who taught at the £ 10,000 - a - year private school , was found dead the day after they spoke to him at his £ 360,000 four - bedroom home in @entity20 , where he lived alone			1
after the 46 - year - old 's computer was seized , officers found hundreds of indecent images			1
it has since emerged that @entity10 had been alerted to the concerns about @entity1 - along with 34 other suspected paedophiles - nine months earlier , as part of @entity31 police ’s @entity29 , but did not act			1
speaking on @entity36 ’s today programme this morning , the county ’s police and crime commissioner @entity34 said : ‘ i understand that mr @entity1 was assessed as low - risk			1
’ he added that it was clear something had ‘ gone wrong ’ - but said @entity1 may not have been the force ’s highest priority , as it dealt with huge amounts of information			1
mr @entity34 also said the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) had received the details in 2012 , but had taken a year to pass it on			1
he stated that the force had charged two people in connection with the @entity29 intelligence , adding : ‘ it ’s not as if they were sitting doing nothing , it ’s a question of priorities ’			0
mr @entity34 added : ‘ my job is to make sure @entity10 are operating as effectively as they can with the resources they have got			1
but this is a case where things have gone wrong			0
workplace : mr @entity1 was employed at £ 10,600 - a - year @entity12 in @entity13 in @entity10 ‘ it was nine months too long and it should have been sooner			1
we need to find out why , but it ’s not just resources			0
we need , and i think we have got , good procedures for acting on the threat of harm to individuals			0
’ mr @entity34 previously said @entity45 procedures may have to be reviewed , along with @entity10 ’s action			1
the case is being reviewed by the @entity69 ( @entity69 )			0
officers have refused to comment further while this process is carried out			0
@entity1 was found dead on september 10			2
his death is not being treated as suspicious			0
it is thought that he had taken images of children at the school and other locations using a hidden camera			1
these pictures are believed to date back to 2000 and feature boys aged from nine to 12			0
@entity10 were originally told of concerns about @entity1 after @entity83 police contacted them in november 2013 with information suggesting he had bought videos of naked boys several years ago			1
a police spokesman said : ‘ it is important to stress that we have found no evidence of any other offences by mr @entity1 involving these children			1
@entity94 : @entity1 tried to destroy the evidence by reportedly setting fire to his computer and other devices and paperwork - and then hanged himself in the garage of his £ 360,000 four - bedroom home ( pictured ) ‘ at this time there is nothing to suggest that he made inappropriate physical contact with any child			1
‘ the school has co-operated with our investigation and we have also found no evidence to suggest that anyone else was involved in mr @entity1 ’s criminal activity			1
there is also no information that he shared any of these images or that anyone else was aware of his offending			2
’ late investigation : @entity10 did nothing about 46 - year - old @entity1 ( pictured ) until three weeks ago @entity10 did nothing about @entity1 until three weeks ago - almost a year after being informed			1
nor did officers warn the school where the it expert regularly took children away on official trips			2
the blunders were compounded when officers failed in a bid to get a search warrant from a magistrate			0
so they simply visited the paedophile ’s home , just over a mile from the school , and politely asked if they could examine his computer			0
he refused and the officers left without arresting him			0
but within hours he tried to destroy the evidence by reportedly setting fire to his computer and other devices and paperwork – and then hanged himself in the garage of his home			0
detectives were still able to recover 75 images taken on a camera that was hidden in a bag in the school ’s male changing rooms			1
there were 465 images from a local swimming pool and 38 from two other unknown locations			1
four boys aged between nine and 12 have been identified as featuring in the images , and their parents informed			0
but in many other cases , faces are not shown , or are out of focus , making it impossible to know the full tally of his victims			0
the case has sparked fresh fears about potentially thousands more paedophiles being left unchecked , despite evidence against them , because @entity166 police are taking so long to act on masses of information from child sex investigations overseas			2
another name on the list of 2,345 suspects given to @entity166 authorities by @entity174 was cancer specialist @entity175 , 41			2
astonishing : shocked parents at the school where @entity1 taught were struggling to cope with the revelation last month @entity175 pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual assault and 12 counts of engaging in sexual activity with a child , with many of the offences taking place at @entity187 in @entity188			1
informed by police : @entity191 ’s headmaster , @entity190 ( pictured ) , said everyone at the school in @entity10 felt ' surprised , angry and betrayed ' he was known to the authorities in 2012 – 16 months before he was arrested for abusing ill children – but investigations were ‘ shelved ’ until november 2013			1
he is expected to be jailed when he returns to court for sentencing			0
last night shocked parents at the school where @entity1 taught were struggling to cope with the revelation			1
a source close to the school told the @entity204 it was feared that as many as 25 pupils had been covertly caught on film			0
he had also masterminded his school ’s computer system , issuing @entity209 to all pupils			0
his digital mastery has led to fears of what else he could have done , and concealed			0
yesterday @entity214 confirmed an adjourned inquest had been told that @entity1 died by hanging			2
there were calls for a thorough investigation into the delays in the investigation			0
local mp @entity221 said : ‘ questions do need to be asked of @entity10 around how quickly this was dealt with			2
’ police informed @entity191 ’s headmaster , @entity190 , that his deputy had killed himself after he had been questioned about buying films of young boys			0
initially mr @entity190 planned a remembrance ceremony and paid a glowing tribute , telling a local newspaper : ‘ it ’s a cutting edge school and he was a cutting edge guy			2
he was an ideal deputy and i could n’t have asked for better			0
’ yesterday , however , mr @entity190 said in a statement : ‘ everyone at @entity12 feels surprised , angry and betrayed			2
’ yesterday an @entity237 police spokesman said there was no evidence of physical abuse by @entity1 of any children			2
there had been insufficient evidence to arrest @entity1 , he added			2
yesterday , a resident in the @entity245 where @entity1 lived said : ‘ i ’ve heard he hanged himself in the garage and was burning papers in his office before then			2
’ @entity1 ’s parents @entity250 , 77 , and @entity252 , 72 , live nearby			0
they were not available for comment			0
@entity10 only yesterday reported itself to the @entity69 for its long delay in investigating @entity1 – weeks after his death			1
