@entity0 rejoiced when @entity1 left @entity2 for @entity3 in 2012 , with the @entity5 striker departing @entity6 with a formidable scoring record of 13 goals in 14 games against @entity10			1
' i do n’t know how much @entity2 miss him but we do n't miss him , ' @entity0 said of the man who averages a goal every 78 minutes and 20 seconds against his team			1
' he did a lot of damage against us in every game			0
' but he might have celebrated too soon			0
@entity1 has 15 goals in 15 games for @entity2 against @entity10 , averaging one every 78 minutes @entity1 's first goals against came in the 2005 @entity24 , scoring both as @entity2 beat @entity10 2 - 1 three weeks later , @entity1 scored again against @entity10 , this time securing a 1 - 0 win in the @entity27 @entity1 ( right ) scored both goals as @entity2 came from behind against @entity10 to win the @entity29 2 - 1 @entity1 ( right ) beat @entity30 to head in @entity2 's second goal and secure the @entity29 now back at @entity2 , @entity1 is expected to overcome a knock and return to the @entity33 on sunday with @entity0 's disesteemed foe @entity34 , looking to increase his overall record of 15 goals in 15 games against @entity10 and obliterate the north - @entity41 side 's fading hope of catching the @entity43 outfit at the summit of the @entity27			1
having originally signed for @entity2 in 2004 for a fee of £ 24million from @entity46 , @entity1 took time to forge his redoubtable status against @entity0 , his first two appearances ending goalless			2
it was the 2005 @entity24 when he first put @entity10 to the sword , lashing two goals past @entity52 in a 2 - 1 victory at the @entity54 before scoring the decisive goal in a 1 - 0 victory in the @entity27 three weeks later			0
in 2007 , @entity1 overturned the one - goal advantage @entity10 had in the 2007 @entity29 through @entity58 with another brace , again in @entity60			2
and @entity1 's third double against @entity10 was in similar circumstances on march 23 , 2008			2
@entity63 gave the @entity64 the lead before @entity1 struck twice in nine minutes at @entity43			0
the 2009 @entity67 semi-final allowed @entity1 to break @entity10 's hearts again with silverware in sight , this time at @entity71			2
like the 2007 @entity29 , @entity58 put @entity10 ahead but @entity72 equalised before @entity1 won the cup tie with a goal in the 84th minute			0
in the next two encounters between the @entity41 sides , @entity1 netted a double in each game to lead @entity2 to a 3 - 0 and 2 - 0 victory respectively			0
on october 3 2010 , he opened the scoring as @entity2 beat @entity10 2 - 0 at @entity43 which was his last goal against @entity10 in @entity2 colours			0
@entity1 ( right ) rounded @entity83 as to lead @entity2 to 2009 @entity67 semi-final victory over @entity10 @entity1 has scored a double five times for @entity2 against @entity10 , including at the @entity33 in 2009 @entity1 ( second right ) also scored twice against @entity10 in the 2 - 0 victory at @entity43 in 2010 @entity1 ( right ) returned to haunt @entity10 with @entity88 , scoring another brace in the @entity90 @entity1 ( left ) is a trusted hugely by @entity2 manager @entity34 , who could start him on sunday but he took his tally top 15 with yet another late brace , this time for @entity88 as @entity1 led the @entity94 side to the @entity90 in 2013 , serving @entity0 a reminder of what he was glad to be missing in the @entity27			1
but @entity1 is synonymous with @entity34 's @entity2			1
@entity0 has not beaten the @entity98 manager in 12 attempts and with @entity100 and @entity101 likely to be unavailable , @entity34 is seemingly faced with no choice but to unleash @entity1 to ensure it 's an unlucky 13th encounter for the @entity10 manager .			1

@entity1 has 15 goals against @entity10 for @entity2 and @entity88
he averages a strike every 78 minutes and 20 seconds against @entity10
@entity1 could be @entity2 's only fit striker for sunday 's trip to the @entity33
