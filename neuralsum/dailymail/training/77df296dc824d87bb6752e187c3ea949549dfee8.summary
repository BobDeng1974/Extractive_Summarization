a gruesome image found on a mobile phone showing an embalmer laughing as he holds aloft a severed head was today at the centre of a police investigation			1

it is one of three images on the phone that show the decapitated body , believed to have been hit by a train			1

disturbing : @entity9 smiles as he holds aloft the dead man 's head in an image stored on a mobile phone that was later found by two children , aged 10 and 12 police yesterday launched an investigation into the shocking images			1
chief inspector @entity35 , of @entity37 police , said : ' the incident is being treated seriously and while we carry out our initial investigation we feel it would be inappropriate to speculate as to the circumstances in which this photo was taken			0
' officers were in the process of seizing the mobile phone so that they could examine the pictures further			1

he said : ' it 's like when you find a wallet , you look inside to see if there 's anything to say who it belongs to			0
' however , after finding that , i do n't want to get in touch with this guy			0
it 's a total lack of respect for the dead			0
' that was probably someone 's father , someone 's son and someone 's brother , it 's unbelievable to think they could do that to someone			2
' the father - of - two , who asked not to be named , described how his children screamed and ran out of the room when the images appeared on his computer			2
also on the phone were lists of mr @entity9 's appointments and an electronic business card for his embalming business			1
idyllic : the @entity37 , in @entity14 , close to where the phone containing pictures of the decapitated head was found he advertises his services at £ 50 pounds for ' straight cases ' , and £ 60 pounds for ' pm ' cases			1

he is understood to live with a cross-dresser , @entity123 , in @entity13			0
when questioned at his home , mr @entity123 refused to comment about the pictures			2

members of the @entity145 abide by a strict code of ethics that included treating every body with respect , they added			0
' if it was one of our members , they 'd be on a disciplinary , and thrown out of the institute '' said the spokesman			0
