remains sifted out of the ground zero rubble during the original recovery efforts following the september 11 attacks have been identified as those of a 26 - year - old @entity6 man			1
@entity7 , dubbed a ' merry prankster ' in an obituary that appeared in the @entity10 , became the 1,640th victim identified from among the debris thanks to dna testing , @entity14 @entity10 reports			1
@entity7 was vice president of technology at @entity15			1
he was in a meeting on the 97th floor in the south tower when @entity19 struck			1
family remember the @entity22 graduate as a funny man			0
' he liked to have fun , ' his mother @entity25 told the @entity10 not long after the tragedy			0
of those , 1,113 victims have not been identified through a dna match to items provided by families — toothbrushes , combs , clothing or swabs from relatives			1
@entity7 was working on the 97th floor of the south tower when @entity47 175 struck with ever - advancing technology yielding results that were impossible a dozen years ago , the unique genetic code gleaned from the bits of bone is the only hope for families waiting for anything tangible to officially confirm what they already know : their loved one is dead			1
in some cases , scientists have gone back to the same bone fragment 10 or 15 times , using new technology to attempt to extract dna diminished by fire , sunlight , bacteria and even the jet fuel that poured through the towers			0
the painstaking process involves pulverizing the bone fragments , adding a special chemical to the powder and then spinning it all in a centrifuge to break open the bone cells so @entity65 can be extracted			0
then comes the last , critical step — looking to match it to an item with the victim 's dna provided by families — part of the medical examiner 's collection of 17,000 contributions			1
family members have long endorsed the ongoing identification process , even as some protested last year 's move of the remains to the museum site , which they fear could be prone to flooding			1
' do n't put them in the basement , ' @entity95 , who lost her firefighter son at the trade center , said at a protest against the move			0
' give them respect so 3,000 souls can rest in peace			0
' other families supported the move , saying the repository is a fitting site for the remains			2
' it will show the world the way we treat our dead , ' @entity115 , who lost his son in the attacks			0
' let 's get them back to the site			2
' new technology : with new technology yielding results impossible a dozen years ago , forensic scientists are still trying to match the bone with dna from those who died on sept. 11 , 2001 , and have never been identified a person demonstrates how to use a device used for milling and extracting @entity65 , at the @entity127 in @entity128			2
@entity7 became victim number 1,640 identified from the debris			1
over 1,100 remain unidentified the question is : how long and at what cost will the forensic team keep working to identify these last 9/11 remains ? the team 's annual salary budget is $ 230,000 , plus costs for follow - up work by other scientists and staff			1
@entity141 said that as new technology becomes available , the efforts to identify the fragments will continue indefinitely			0
@entity144 , founding director of the @entity145 at the @entity146 , said that work must continue ' because our relationship to the sept. 11 disaster hinges on being able to identify and pay respects to those who died			0
' for @entity141 , it 's not just a grim scientific task — it 's personal			2
he was under the still - standing towers minutes after the two hijacked planes hit them , having rushed down with the then - chief medical examiner , dr. @entity160			0
as the towers toppled , the men were struck and bloodied by falling glass and debris			2
' it 's a service and an honor , working on something that has transformed @entity169 history , ' he said			0
the death toll stemming from the attacks at the @entity34 stands at 2,753			0
of those , 1,113 victims have not been identified through a dna match to items provided by families — toothbrushes , combs , clothing or swabs from relatives impossible to forget : there have been no identifications of 1,113 missing people and 7,703 of the samples of human remains can not be identified			1

@entity7 was at a meeting at @entity15 on the 97th floor when @entity19 struck below
the @entity193 *native* 's remains were tested from those sifted from the original ground zero recovery
@entity7 becomes the 1,640th victim positively identified from the rubble . that leaves 1,113 victims remains still unidentified
