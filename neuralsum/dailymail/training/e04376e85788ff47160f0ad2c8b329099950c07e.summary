by @entity0 @entity1 has ordered the @entity2 not to publicly consider anything but outright victory , but privately a plan is being hatched to do a deal with @entity8 unionists senior @entity2 are secretly preparing the ground for a potential power - sharing deal with unionist mps from @entity12 in the event of another hung parliament after next year ’s general election			1
@entity1 and @entity16 have ordered ministers to say nothing in public to indicate they believe their party is contemplating anything other than outright victory			2
but privately , many fear the @entity23 are likely to struggle to assemble a majority , though they are increasingly confident that they can remain the largest party			2
if they again fall short of the 326 mps needed for an outright win , senior @entity2 suggest the @entity29 mps from @entity12 could hold the balance of power			1
currently , the party has eight mps , making it the fourth largest party in @entity34			0
mr @entity1 will face a battle with sections of his party if he seeks to enter another coalition with the @entity39			1
he has promised mps a formal say , and around 40 @entity2 are thought to be unlikely to back another deal with @entity43 under any circumstances			1
senior conservatives are now floating either a so - called ‘ confidence and supply ’ arrangement , which would mean guaranteeing support on votes of confidence in the @entity51 measures , or a more formal power - sharing agreement with the @entity29			1
one well - placed source said : ‘ the @entity29 is definitely being wooed			0
of course people are thinking about these things			0
’ a @entity23 cabinet minister said a narrow overall victory next year was possible because voters were concluding @entity61 is ‘ unelectable ’ , but a second coalition with the @entity39 was still the most likely outcome			1
but behind the scenes there was ‘ a lot of cosying up ’ to the @entity29 and there was ‘ much talk of them helping keep a minority @entity23 administration in business ’ , the minister said			1
last month , in a sign of the efforts being made behind the scenes , the prime minister hosted a lavish reception in the @entity81 garden @entity29 mps			1
the @entity29 is now said to be already drawing up its demands as the price of supporting the @entity23 in another hung @entity85 after next year ’s election – likely to include protection from some government spending cuts			1
@entity12 secretary @entity89 has already signed an agreement with the @entity91 on an economic development package			0
it raises the prospect of @entity95 , deputy leader of the @entity29 and mp for @entity97 , sitting in a @entity34 government conservative mp @entity99 , parliamentary aide to @entity100 , senior parliamentary adviser to the prime minister , said his party should ‘ reach out now ’ to the @entity29			2
he pointed out that when a similar deal was mooted before the 2010 election , the @entity29 was said to be demanding a commitment to cancel £ 200 million of cuts to @entity12 ’s public sector			2
‘ more sensible terms should follow from a better relationship with some issues scoped out in advance , ’ mr @entity99 said			0
‘ @entity113 government has taught us the importance of developing and nurturing connections with other political parties			0
’ he pointed out that the @entity29 was the only other party that had backed a @entity23 commitment to give voters a say on @entity122 ’s membership of the @entity123			2
‘ both @entity124 and the @entity39 have explicitly ruled out a referendum on our membership of the @entity123			0
it could just be that an alliance with the other political party represented in @entity34 that wants to protect our sovereignty will enable us to deliver on our commitment to renegotiate our relationship with the @entity123 , deliver a historic referendum and govern again after may 2015 , ’ he added			0
around 40 conservative mps are reportedly ready to block the idea of a second coalition with @entity43 's @entity39 , if mr @entity1 again falls short of an overall majority @entity138 , editor of the @entity140 website , said : ‘ were a 2010 - style result to happen , two main options are canvassed – a second coalition , or a minority government			1
’ but he said there was a third – ‘ a confidence and supply arrangement with @entity12 ’s @entity149 ’			0
‘ the province ’s mps have a history of importance in @entity154 in which the government of the day has a small majority , or none at all			2
@entity81 is certainly eyeing the @entity29 with interest , ’ he added			0
the @entity159 helped to prop up @entity161 ’s government during the 1990s and @entity162 ’s in the 1970s			0
the prospect of a @entity23 - @entity29 deal came as it emerged allies of @entity43 and @entity61 have met to discuss common ground between @entity124 and the @entity39			1
the @entity124 peer @entity170 , and @entity172 , one of mr @entity61 's closest advisers , met @entity174 , mr @entity43 's chief of staff and @entity175 , a senior @entity39 and donor , the @entity169 ’s @entity168 programme reported			0
the group met for dinner at a @entity180 restaurant in april			0
there is increasing speculation at @entity34 that @entity124 also fears it will fail to win a majority next year and is contemplating a coalition with the @entity39			1
@entity186 dem business secretary @entity185 , said to want to be chancellor in a @entity189 government , said yesterday such informal contacts between @entity39 and @entity124 were ‘ totally sensible ’ but not preparations for future coalition .			2

*exclusive* : senior @entity2 examining plan to form a government with @entity29
@entity1 needs to win more than 326 seats to secure outright majority
