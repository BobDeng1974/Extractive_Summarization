between times , the 180,000 residents of @entity4 , near @entity20 , get only their recycling bins emptied			1
despite residents ’ anger , there were warnings that the new policy is likely to spread rapidly to other councils			1

his ministers condemned the decision by @entity38 - controlled @entity4 and accused the party of having ‘ an agenda of monthly bin collections ’			1
but there was no criticism from the @entity44 , which has been pressing councils to increase their efforts to enforce recycling to hit @entity48 targets the three - weekly system is being pioneered by one council in each of @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 and yesterday the @entity54 ( @entity55 ) gave the green light for others to follow			1

the announcement has enraged residents			2
@entity2 and @entity75 of @entity3 , near @entity4 fear their garden will be overrun with rats if they wait three weeks between rubbish collections			1
they they are committed to recycling but even so their grey waste bin is always full after a fortnight			1
‘ there are just some things that have to go in the rubbish bin , ’ said mrs @entity2			1
‘ we even try to use washable nappies as much as possible , but we do use some disposables and having them in the bin for three weeks would be just horrible			2
‘ one of my friends said there is already a rat problem where they live and it will only get worse			0
‘ council tax is going up but the service is going down			0
’ retired taxi driver @entity100 , 69 , said : ‘ it ’s a scandalous idea			0
the streets will end up a mess			2
there will be rats and more fly - tipping , it ’s absolutely disgusting			1
’ one resident wrote on the council website : ‘ do n’t i already pay to have my bins taken away ? can i opt out of paying council tax for refuse collection and get someone else to do it ? ’ first : @entity115 wants to become the first in @entity51 to collect its main household bin once every three weeks , suggesting it will save £ 1million a year @entity118 , of the @entity119 , warned : ‘ if @entity4 get away with this , all the others will follow			1
after that they will move to monthly collections			1
they do n’t really want to collect the rubbish at all – they would rather make us all use private waste contractors			2
’ but the @entity55 said : ‘ there is no one size - fits - all solution when it comes to bins , and councils will always work with householders to find the best way to collect the waste in their particular area			2
our polling shows that the vast majority of people are happy with the way their bins are collected			0
’ @entity4 council said it aims to drive up household recycling rates to 50 per cent			2
environment chief @entity144 said : ‘ most households will continue to have a collection of at least one type of waste every week			0

a lot of this waste could be recycled			0
we know we can and must do more			0
despite residents ’ anger , there were warnings that the new policy is likely to spread rapidly to other councils			2
