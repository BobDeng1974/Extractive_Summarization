when @entity1 took @entity2 to @entity3 to see the @entity4 play the @entity5 last week , he had a diamond ring in his back pocket and a big plan			1
@entity1 had already informed @entity10 's parents that he planned on asking @entity2 to be his wife and that he was going to project the romantic question on the stadium 's jumbotron			1
@entity1 , the entire @entity10 family , and secretly hired wedding photographer @entity17 , made their way to the stadium for an unforgettable and comedic night			1
but their camera ready moment was ruined when a disgruntled old woman watching the game made her feelings known by flipping the bird to the camera			2
@entity1 ( right ) proposes to @entity2 ( left ) at @entity3 as an old woman ( front ) gives the middle finger to photographer , @entity17 : @entity30 @entity1 proposed to @entity2 by projecting ' will you marry me , @entity2 ? ' on the giant stadium jumbotron : @entity30 the couple enjoyed a romantic evening despite being flipped off by the old lady in some of the photographs taken by @entity17 : @entity30 @entity2 knew that @entity1 was going to propose to her at some point but did n't know exactly when			1
according to coverage from @entity41 , hours earlier at a taco bell , @entity2 picked up a hot sauce packet that read , ' will you marry me ? ' she reportedly threw the hot sauce packet at @entity45 and said , ' see ? even @entity46 thinks you should marry me			1
' when the family arrived at the game , everything was set for the jumbo plan			2
@entity17 and her husband were standing a few rows away from the family ready to snap of photo of @entity1 and @entity10 the moment he popped the question			2
not planned was the fact that the photographer was going to be seated near an older couple who wanted to watch the game and nothing but the game			1
as soon as the jumbotron flashed , ' will you marry me , @entity2 ? ' the photographer stood up to take a photo of the proposal and the grouchy older couple yelled at her to sit down			1
upon taking the photograph , @entity68 explained to the elderly couple that she was only standing monetarily to photograph the proposal			2
@entity1 dropped to his knee			2
@entity2 said , ' yes ! ' and the crowd cheered			1
' he got down on one knee and that 's when i realized it was me and i just started crying and it was a great moment , ' @entity10 says			2
@entity2 displays her new engagement ring after @entity1 proposed to her for the entire @entity79 stadium to see the older woman seated near @entity81 was none too pleased			1
another person who was with the older couple even called over a security guard because she could n't return to her seat			1
' they kept yelling at me and i just ignored them because i was there to do a job and i did not want to miss something that would be so brief and so important , ' @entity68 says			0
once the security guard came over to @entity68 , she moved out of the unhappy trio 's way			1
it was n't until the next day that @entity68 found an unwanted surprise in an otherwise romantic photograph of @entity1 and @entity10			0
' in about 20 of them , she and her friend are giving me the stink eye , ' @entity68 says			0
@entity2 's facebook page humorously displays @entity107 's photo as her profile picture in one of the photos the older woman is pictured flipping her middle finger at the camera			1
@entity68 was worried the couple might be disappointed at first , but @entity10 was extremely amused			0
' i could n't stop laughing			0
i said it was the greatest photo i 've ever seen ... there is a girl sitting behind us that is so excited for us			0
my mom is crying , i 'm crying , and @entity124 's nervous and then there 's this lady flipping us off , ' says @entity10			0
@entity10 joked about making the photo a ' save the date ' magnet for friends and family			0
while some friends were sad for @entity10 that the old woman may have ruined her special moment , @entity10 maintained her sense of humor and poise			0
@entity10 is quoted as saying that is she finds out the identity of the curmudgeon she 'd like to , ' make her famous			0
' she has even offered to invite the old lady to the wedding			0
' i would love for her to appear in one of my pictures at the wedding			0
that would be terrific , ' @entity10 says			0
