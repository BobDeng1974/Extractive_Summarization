waking up one morning , @entity0 was alarmed to find that everything seemed very different			1
‘ it felt like somebody had put a brick wall up against my right side , ’ she says			0
‘ i called out to my husband @entity6 and when he replied i could only hear his voice in my left ear			1
’ @entity0 ( pictured ) woke up one morning unable to hear out of her right ear initially , @entity0 , 45 , who lives in @entity10 with @entity6 , 49 , a school caretaker , and their son @entity14 , 12 , thought the problem was probably caused by a wax blockage and would correct itself within a few days			1
but when it did n’t , a week after her first symptoms she went to see her gp and was referred to an ear , nose and throat consultant			1
the specialist dropped a bombshell — she had lost the hearing in her right ear , possibly for good			1
‘ at that point i became very tearful			0
i was so worried my hearing would never return , ’ she says			2
@entity0 , a finance assistant , was even more overwhelmed when doctors could not explain why it had happened			1
@entity0 is one of up to 6,000 adults a year estimated to develop idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss , or unexplained hearing loss , that usually develops suddenly , or within three days , usually in one ear			1
often , sudden hearing loss can be attributed to infections , certain medications , head injuries and meningitis , because these can all affect the inner ear			1
but in some cases , such as @entity0 ’s , there is no clear explanation			1
the hearing organ , the cochlea , is found deep in the inner ear			1
it is filled with fluid — when soundwaves enter it , the fluid moves and tiny hair cells then trigger signals to the auditory nerve , which passes the signals to the brain			0
these are recognised as sounds , allowing us to hear			2
sensorineural hearing loss is down to problems in the inner ear or with the auditory nerve			1
the other type — conductive hearing loss — occurs when something has physically blocked transmissions of sound , such as wax			2
‘ eighty - five per cent of the time no one ever knows why sudden sensorineural hearing loss occurs because we ca n’t get to the inner ear to examine it without risking damaging it , or damaging the brain , ’ says @entity70 , the consultant ear , nose and throat surgeon at @entity74 and @entity75 who treated @entity0			1
the most popular theory is that it ’s caused by a virus damaging the nerve in the inner ear			2
another is that a blood clot blocks a blood vessel that leads to the inner ear			2
a benign tumour on an inner ear nerve may also cause sudden hearing loss — but this is rare			1
whatever the cause , losing your hearing suddenly can be ‘ very traumatic ’ says mr @entity70			2
‘ hearing loss usually occurs in one ear so people get scared it will happen in the other ear , too			1
they often get balance problems because the inner ear contains the balance organ , the labyrinth , too			2
@entity0 ( pictured ) initially assumed that the problem was caused by a wax blockage and that it would correct itself within a few days ‘ losing balance function on one side can make someone feel disorientated before the brain eventually adapts			1
’ and the damage is often permanent			0
one year after sudden hearing loss , a third of patients do n’t recover any hearing , a third recover fully and the remainder have some hearing loss			2
waking up one morning having suddenly lost your hearing is considered a medical emergency and , if this happens , you should see a doctor that day , advises mr @entity70			1
it may be hard for patients to distinguish a genuine emergency from the muffled hearing that comes with a cold , so see a gp if in doubt			2
steroids are currently the only treatment option to help patients regain some hearing — they can improve the outcome , in some cases , if taken within two weeks and are thought to help by calming inflammation			2
they used to be given orally , but the latest thinking is to inject steroids directly into the eardrum			0
the number of people in @entity143 with hearing aids			0
‘ if someone loses all their hearing , cochlear implants can cost up to £ 40,000 , so prevention of permanent deafness is key , ’ says mr @entity70			0
a study in the @entity151 found there is ‘ less recovery of hearing when treatment is delayed ’			0
it ’s also less likely to return in under - 15s and over- 65s , although it ’s not known why , as well as in people who suffer from vertigo or who had poor hearing beforehand			0
thankfully , @entity0 ’s hearing has partially returned — which is likely to be down to her seeking medical help quickly			1
when she saw mr @entity70 , a week after her symptoms appeared , he prescribed a three - week course of steroid tablets			1
‘ on the fifth day of the course i started to hear a muffled , squeaky noise through my right ear , ’ she says			1
‘ i had a couple of side - effects — shakes and tiredness — from the drugs , but it was worth it			0
without them i could have been deaf in that ear my whole life			0
’ a couple of weeks after finishing the course she regained 50 per cent of her hearing in her right ear , but nonetheless needed to have a hearing aid fitted			1
@entity0 ( pictured ) was given a three week course of steroid tablets and she eventually regained 50 per cent of the hearing in her right ear although she still needed to have a hearing aid fitted this has helped ‘ a lot ’ , she says , though she admits : ‘ i feel much too young for one			1
’ a nasty consequence of her hearing loss has been severe tinnitus ( in which a phantom ringing or buzzing is heard ) in her right ear			1
‘ it ’s the worst part of the whole experience , like a constant waterfall in my ear			0
’ people with hearing loss often develop tinnitus , explains mr @entity70			0
‘ because the brain is n’t receiving sound from the ear it tries to strain to hear more and so picks up sounds that do n’t have a genuine source			1
’ hearing aids are usually the first option			0
people with severe or profound hearing loss , especially in both ears , may find hearing aids do n’t help			0
one option is a cochlear implant — an electronic device that is surgically implanted that does the work of the damaged section of the ear			0
@entity217 had one fitted in october 2013			0
the 41 - year - old marketing manager , from @entity219 , suddenly lost hearing in one ear in 2009 and the other in 2010 , both overnight			2
this happened after she was diagnosed with @entity225 ’s disease , which is caused by pressure within the inner ear and causes vertigo , tinnitus and hearing loss			2
‘ i was in complete panic when i woke up one day in 2010 and everything was awfully quiet			0
i saw my partner ’s lips move , but i could n’t hear any words coming out			0
i knew that my hearing had completely gone			0
’ people with @entity225 ’s often develop total hearing loss			0
@entity239 tried hearing aids , but they became ineffective after a few months and so a cochlear implant became her only option			0
‘ after it was turned on i could hear people ’s voices again — i was so happy , ’ she says			0
as for @entity0 , she has learned to live with her hearing loss			1
‘ without my husband and son ’s support this would have been much worse , ’ she says			0

@entity0 woke up one morning unable to hear out of her right ear
she initially assumed that it was a build up of earwax that would soon clear
when she still could *n't* hear a week later she was given steroid tablets
she has regained 50 per cent of her hearing but needed a hearing aid fitted
