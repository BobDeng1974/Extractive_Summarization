a group of 11 terrorists with links to @entity3 were yesterday being interrogated on whether they are behind the disappearance of @entity5			1
the suspects were arrested in the capital @entity10 and in the state of @entity12 last week and are members of a violent new terror group said to be planning bomb attacks in @entity15 countries			1
the interrogations come after international investigators , including the @entity18 and @entity19 , asked for the militants , whose ages range from 22 to 55 and include students , odd - job workers , a young widow and business professionals , to be questioned intensively about flight mh370			1
it is thought to have crashed into the @entity43 with 239 people on board			2
an officer with the @entity47 of @entity48 said yesterday the arrests had heightened suspicion that the flight ’s disappearance may have been an act of terrorism			2
‘ the possibility that the plane was diverted by militants is still high on the list and international investigators have asked for a comprehensive report on this new terror group , ’ the officer said			1
in interviews conducted so far , some suspects have admitted planning ‘ sustained terror campaigns ’ in @entity66 but denied being involved in the disappearance of the airliner , he added			1
during the trial of @entity69 's son - in - law , @entity68 ( left ) said he had been instructed to give a shoe bomb to the @entity66			0
he claimed @entity71 masterminded the plot during the trial of @entity69 's son - in - law , @entity68 , a @entity73 - born @entity15 from @entity74 , said he had been instructed at a terrorist training camp in @entity76 to give a shoe bomb to the @entity66			0
he said : ' i gave one of my shoes to the @entity66			0
i think it was to access the cockpit			0
' @entity68 , who spoke via video link and is in hiding in the @entity73 , told the @entity85 court the @entity66 plot was being masterminded by @entity71 , the principal architect of 9/11			0
a mystery surrounding the cargo being carried by the missing @entity28 plane emerged on friday when it was discovered that it had been loaded with items not specified on the manifest			1
the aircraft was carrying 4.566 tonnes of mangosteens - an exotic fruit - and a shipment of lithium batteries , which were part of a separate consignment			1
the batteries weighed 200kg , but that separate consignment totalled 2.453 tonnes			1
so what was being carried to make up the 2.253 tonnes in that separate shipment ? questions have been raised as @entity28 said it will close assistance centres in @entity39 and @entity10 for the families of the 239 passengers and crew on board the @entity111 jet			1
relatives of passengers aboard flight mh370 prepare to leave a hotel where they have been staying in @entity39 after @entity28 said it would close all its assistance centres for relatives the missing the closures come after rescuers abandoned their fruitless air search for the missing jet , which had focused on a remote area of the @entity43 off @entity125 's west coast			0
the mystery was sparked by a spokesman for the company that shipped the batteries telling a @entity66 newspaper that he would not reveal what the remaining 2.253 tonnes of cargo were			1
' i can not reveal more because of the ongoing investigations , ' the spokesman told @entity137 newspaper			1
' we have been told by our legal advisers not to talk about it			2
' the spokesman said he could not even name the company which manufactured the batteries , insisting that the matter was confidential			2
questioned about the fact that a mystery cargo was not stated in the manifest , @entity28 told the paper that the rest of the consignment was ' radio accessories and chargers			2
' a statement from the airline said that the freight not specified had been ' declared as radio accessories ' , despite there being no reference to this in the manifest released publicly last thursday			2
what the manifest does say is that @entity162 shipped 133 pieces of one item weighing 1.99 tonnes and 67 pieces of another item weighing 463kg for a total ' consolidated weight ' of 2.453 tonnes			0
just how many lithium batteries had been loaded , or their weight , are not specified in the manifest , although @entity28 boss @entity172 told a media conference in @entity10 on march 24 that the batteries weighed a total of 200kg			1
what the manifest does say , in respect of the lithium batteries , is that ' the package must be handled with care and that a flammability hazard exists if the package is damaged			1
' special procedures must be followed in the event the package is damaged , to include inspection and repacking if necessary			0
' still praying for answers : a relative of a missing passenger inside a prayer room at @entity194 in @entity39 there has been earlier speculation that a fire involving the batteries might have been the cause of the aircraft 's fate			2
according to @entity137 , shippers @entity162 are located at an air freight forwarding warehouse located less than 100 yards from the @entity204			0
' the complex is guarded by the police and only those with passes are allowed entry , ' the newspaper said , following its investigation into the unspecified cargo			0
a consolidated shipment combines several individual consignments to make up a full container load			0
at the port of destination , the consolidated shipment is separated back into individual consignments for delivery to their respective consignees			0
the lithium batteries and the other mystery items that are said to be radio parts were addressed to @entity225 in @entity39 , but a company named @entity227 of @entity39 was to collect the cargo on its behalf			1
a policeman naps beside a board written with messages for passengers aboard the missing fight at the hotel among the conspiracy theories that have already emerged following the @entity111 's disappearance on march 8 , is that its fate was linked to 20 of the 239 people on board - they were employees of a semi-conductor manufacturing firm which develops components for hi - tech weapons systems and aircraft navigation			0
they were employees of @entity248 , a @entity249 technology firm , working in several manufacturing sites in @entity10 and @entity251 , @entity252 , a fact confirmed by a spokeswoman for the company			1
the citizens news site @entity258 , said earlier that it was conceivable that @entity5 was ' hiding ' with its high - tech electronic warfare weaponry			0
' in fact , this type of technology is precisely the expertise of @entity248 , that has 20 employees on board the missing flight , ' said the website			0
however , until a detailed description of the ' radio parts ' that have not been itemised in the @entity5 manifest has been made available , the conspiracy theories are likely to be given an added thrust .			0

suspects were arrested in the capital @entity10 and the state of @entity12
