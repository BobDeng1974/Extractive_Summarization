by @entity0 published : 06:28 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 09:54 est , 8 february 2013 a leading hedge fund boss is suing @entity2 demanding the world 's richest technology company moves to unlock its vast $ 137bn cash holdings to stockholders after the share price fell by more than a third since september last year			1
@entity8 , boss of @entity9 , said @entity2 , which has a current stock market value of $ 429.5bn , has a ' depression - era ' mentality that led it to hoard cash			1
around two - thirds of @entity2 's $ 137bn cash pile is held overseas , and repatriating it into the @entity17 would incur a steep tax bill , a problem faced by many top @entity17 technology companies			1
a magic wand ? hedge - fund boss @entity8 , has filed suit against @entity2 saying the company needs to do more to unlock value for shareholders @entity8 , a well - known short - seller , criticised @entity2 in an interview with @entity28 saying it only investing in the safest , lowest - yielding securities			1
his lawsuit targets a proposal by @entity2 to change its corporate charter which would stop it from issuing a type of high - yielding share which could pay out billions of dollars			1
he urged @entity2 shareholders to vote against the plan at the company 's annual meeting on february 27 , and put forward a proposal of his own for the company to preffered stock with a perpetual 4 per cent dividend			2
labelling @entity2 shares ' utterly misvalued ' , at their current level , @entity8 said the company no longer needs to grow at the near - triple - digit rates of the past			1
breakthrough products : but the @entity51 maker has seen its share price tumble by over a third in recent months in an open letter to investors he said : ' we understand that many of our fellow shareholders share our frustration with @entity2 's capital allocation policies			1
' @entity2 has $ 145 per share of cash on its balance sheet			2
as a shareholder , this is your money			0
' @entity8 claimed that for every $ 50 billion in preferred stock that @entity2 gives away to shareholders , it could unlock $ 32 a share in value for investors			1
but @entity2 hit back saying @entity8 's lawsuit over the shareholder proposal was misguided			1
' contrary to @entity9 's statements , adoption of proposal # 2 would not prevent the issuance of preferred stock , ' it said in a statement			0
' currently , @entity2 's articles of incorporation provide for the issuance of ' blank check ' preferred stock by the board of directors without shareholder approval			1
' if proposal # 2 is adopted , our shareholders would have the right to approve the issuance of preferred stock			0
' the lawsuit is @entity2 's first major challenge from an activist shareholder and comes as it grapples with a tumbling share price and mounting competition in the smartphone and tablet markets			1
there are also growing concerns among potential investors about the company 's ability to produce new breakthrough products in the @entity107 era			1
@entity2 nearly went broke in the 1990s before @entity108 returned and engineered a sensational turnaround , with products such as the @entity51 and @entity111 that became must - haves for consumers around the world			2
the company 's near - death experience has led @entity2 to be exceptionally conservative with its cash			1
last march , just months after @entity107 ' death , @entity2 responded to a barrage of investor criticism over its large cash hoard by initiating a quarterly cash dividend and a share buyback that would pay out $ 45 billion over three years			1
at the time , @entity2 was sitting on $ 98 billion in cash			2
@entity2 shares , which had fallen 35 percent from the record high hit in mid-september through wednesday , ended 3 percent higher at $ 468.22			1
foreign : how @entity17 's biggest technology companies keep most of their cash abroad @entity8 , whose @entity9 fund had a sub-par year in large part because of @entity2 's late - 2012 stock swoon , said the company needs to fix its ' cash problem '			1
' it has sort of a mentality of a depression			0
in other words , people who have gone through traumas ... and @entity2 has gone through a couple of traumas in its history , they sometimes feel like they can never have enough cash , ' @entity8 said on @entity28			1
investors , who have long railed against what they saw as @entity2 's ultra-conservative attitude toward its cash , rallied around @entity8 in principle			1
in an interview with @entity151 , @entity8 said he had gone to @entity2 ceo @entity152 in recent weeks after the company 's chief financial officer , @entity153 , brushed off his entreaties in september			1
hedge fund boss @entity8 has a history of activism , usually directed at struggling companies or those grappling with management issues			0
in 2011 , he urged @entity161 to get rid of chief executive @entity162 , accusing him of being ' stuck in the past '			0
@entity8 slashed his stake in the software giant six months later			0
@entity8 has enjoyed something of a cult following in the $ 2 trillion hedge fund industry ever since his bearish call on @entity169 in early 2008			2
but 2012 was not his best year			0
thanks to losses on @entity2 and in the gold market , @entity9 posted a modest 8.3 percent gain for the year after losing 2.8 percent in december , a person familiar with the fund 's performance said			2
that lagged the @entity179 's 13.4 percent gain , excluding dividends			0
you could see @entity8 stirring up other activist investors , to twist them			0
i would certainly applaud their efforts , ' said @entity186 , portfolio manager at @entity187 , which owns @entity2 stock			0
@entity152 , who is rarely known to engage investors in exclusive conversations , was unaware of the earlier conversations with @entity192 , according to @entity8			0
' when i discussed this with @entity152 , and actually , the conversation has been going on for the last couple of weeks , he said that he was n't familiar with my previous conversations with @entity153 and whoever @entity153 's advisers were			0
i was surprised by that , " @entity8 told @entity151			0
analysts have expected stockholder pressure to increase as @entity2 's share price declines and its outlook grows murkier			1
the @entity205 company had $ 137.1 billion in cash , short - term and long - term marketable securities such as @entity208 at the end of 2012 , with over $ 94 billion of that overseas			2
' this is something that we continuously assess , the opportunities to both invest in the business and return cash , ' @entity2 's @entity153 said on the company 's post-results conference call last month			1
' we do consider increasing these programs , and we 'll do what we think is in the best interest of our shareholders			0
it remains to be seen whether other major @entity2 investors will get behind @entity8 's initiative			2
@entity225 called the preferred stock idea ' interesting and unique '			0
he also said he supported @entity8 's opposition to the shareholder proposal and would vote against it , saying , " there 's no reason to put something like that in			2
' on the flip side , the @entity233 , which owns 2.7 million @entity2 shares , urged investors earlier this week to vote in favor of the shareholder proposal , and opposes ' blank check ' preferred shares			2
money managers have complained that @entity2 stockpiles excessive cash and does a poor job putting it to work			2
the weighted - average interest rate earned on its cash , cash equivalents and marketable securities came to just 1.07 percent in its 2013 fiscal first quarter and 1.02 percent in the 2012 fiscal year			0
@entity2 's late founder and ceo @entity108 ( left ) and current ceo @entity152 ( right ) there are growing concerns about the company 's ability to produce new breakthrough products in the post- @entity107 era some questioned whether taking the company to court was the right way to induce action			1
' if you own the company you should let management have some say in how they run it			0
i 'm not a fan of using the legal system to address what should be a corporate issue , ' said @entity271 , chief equity strategist at @entity273 funds			0
@entity274 , an associate professor of law at @entity275 , said @entity8 does have legal standing to bring his case , even though it has little precedent			0
@entity9 's lawsuit takes aim at what it calls the ' bundling ' of several proposals into a single vote			0
@entity9 wants the proposals separated so a vote can be taken specifically on @entity2 's move to strike preferred shares from its company charter			1
@entity9 alleges that @entity2 is not complying with @entity289 rules requiring separate votes for distinct and unrelated amendments to the charter			0
' this procedural legal strategy is merely a vehicle to raise his profile and promote his agenda about shaping @entity2 's corporate strategy , ' @entity274 said of @entity8			1
@entity8 's actions go well beyond increasingly common shareholder calls for @entity2 to increase its dividend or buy back shares			1
@entity8 argues preferred stock - which functions like a bond in that it pays a fixed dividend over time - is a better route because the company wo n't have to use cash right away			2
analysts say another benefit is up to 80 per cent of the dividends from preferred stock can be tax - free for corporate investors , and it is not logged as debt on the balance sheet			0
but the tactic is generally pursued by low - growth companies , where capital gains are less assured			0
' the idea is powerful , and when i have a chance to explain it to the shareholders , most will see it as an enormous win - win ' , @entity8 told @entity151			0
@entity8 said he suggested to @entity2 an initial preferred share distribution , in which dividends could be funded on an ongoing basis by a relatively small percentage of the company 's operating cash flow			1
' @entity2 rejected the idea outright in september 2012 , ' he said , and then refused to withdraw the proposal to eliminate preferred stock from its charter			0
some investors saw merit in @entity8 's argument			0
' it 's a great company but their greatest weakness is capital allocation , ' said @entity225 , portfolio manager of the $ 417 million @entity339 fund , which has some 17 per cent of his portfolio in @entity2 .			2

@entity8 accuses @entity2 of having a ' depression - era ' mentality
lawsuit targets a proposal by @entity2 to stop issuing high - yielding shares
two - thirds of @entity2 's $ 137bn cash pile is currently held abroad
bringing that money into the @entity17 would incur a huge tax bill
