by @entity0 published : 09:11 est , 15 august 2013 updated : 10:01 est , 15 august 2013 if you 're wondering where all the good men are , new research would advise you to head north - at least if bedroom skills are what you 're after			0
@entity7 is the place where you 'll encounter @entity10 's best lovers , according to results of the nationwide survey which found local men achieved 9.3 out of 10 in the satisfaction stakes			2
@entity16 lovers , with an average score of 2.3 out of ten , were voted the least satisfactory			2
women from across the nation were also asked which men were most considerate of a woman 's sexual needs			1
from this , it appears @entity16 locals try hard ( they came second for conscientiousness , with a 9.3 score ) , but to little effect			2
@entity30 men achieved an average top score of 9.5 for their thoughtfulness , while lazy @entity33 came bottom of the list with just 3.3			1
men living with their partners in @entity7 scored the highest in satisfaction , with 9.3 out of 10 the study takes a look into the bedroom habits and preferences of those around the @entity10 ; focusing bedroom satisfaction amongst men and women			1
more than 1,000 ( 1,802 ) women currently in a co-habiting relationship , aged 18 and over , took part			0
all respondents were required to state which county / region in the @entity10 they and their partner currently lived in			0
the women taking part were initially asked to rate their partner in terms of sexual satisfaction in the bedroom , with 1 meaning their bedroom antics were n't at all satisfying for them sexually ; and 10 meaning that they were extremely satisfied			1

the majority of these , 56 per cent , though lack of sex could be to blame			0
1 ) @entity30 - 9.52 ) @entity16 - 9.33 ) @entity62 - 9.24 ) @entity7 - 8.95 ) @entity59 - 8.7 1 ) @entity71 - 3.32 ) @entity70 - 3.53 ) @entity92 - 3.64 ) @entity93 - 3.85 ) @entity72 - 3.9 @entity16 men were second most conscientious , but least satisfying @entity95 of @entity96 , the online pharmacy specialising in sexual health who commissioned the research , says : ' bedroom satisfaction is vital for any healthy , sexual relationship ; as a poor or unhappy sex life can cause problems along the line			1
' it seems that the @entity107 breeds quite a satisfying lover , with blokes from the @entity110 also rating quite highly in terms of satisfaction and conscientiousness in the bedroom department			0
perhaps those in the city need to take a little time and put some greater effort in - @entity71 featured low in both lists , so there may well be a correspondence between city life and bedroom happiness ! '			0

@entity33 least concerned with women 's sexual needs
@entity16 men second most conscientious , but least satisfying
those from @entity30 most considerate in bed
60 per cent of women say their partners are happy with their sex lives
