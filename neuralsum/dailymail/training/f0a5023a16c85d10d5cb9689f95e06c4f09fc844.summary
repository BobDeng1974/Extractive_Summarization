a middle - class mother with £ 300,000 in a @entity3 bank account and children in top fee - paying schools carried on claiming benefits as ' pocket money ' , a court was told today			1
@entity9 , 58 , was a ' greedy ' woman who had made a ' calm , calculated and rational ' decision to abuse the benefits system out of more than £ 20,000 , @entity8 heard			1
she is alleged to have claimed income support , @entity14 and council tax and housing benefits , while she had more than £ 300,000 in the bank			1
@entity9 , 58 , of @entity17 , @entity18 , is accused of committing a £ 20,000 benefits fraud ms @entity9 , formerly of @entity20 , @entity21 , but now living in @entity17 , @entity18 , denies four charges of dishonestly failing to report a change in her circumstances and dishonestly making false representations to obtain benefits between march 2007 and march 2009			1
the court heard the interest she was receiving on her money was around £ 300 every couple of weeks - more than the benefits she was claiming			1
yet when she filled out forms certifying she still qualified for benefits she said she had only £ 100 in a @entity35 account			1
' this case is about greed really , ' said prosecutor @entity38			0
' it involves her making a calm , calculated and rational decision , in fact quite a number of them , to top up her already quite substantial income by making false claims for benefit			0
' he told the court @entity9 had abused a system designed to be a safety net for people unable to finance their lives and in danger of ending up sleeping rough on the streets			2
he added : ' it is not supposed to be a source of pocket money or additional income for wealthy people like ms @entity9 who decide that is what they would like			2
' it is the prosecution case that this is a thoroughly dishonest woman who decided to get money she knew she was not entitled to in the hope and expectation , and arrogance , that she would not be caught			0
' greedy people bank on not being caught but this was a gamble in respect of which this woman failed			2
' the benefit rules did not allow anyone with more than £ 16,000 in the bank to be paid any state benefits , he said			1
she paid the money into an @entity85 bank and then started using the money which included paying fees to @entity88 ( pictured ) , it was said until march 30th 2007 she did qualify but she then sold a house which made her £ 306,000 , said mr @entity38			1
she paid the money into an @entity85 bank and then started using the money which included paying fees to @entity88 , @entity93 and @entity94 , @entity95 , he said			0
' these are not cheap schools , ' he said			0
' between 2007 and 2009 when she was claiming poverty and penury she paid in the region of £ 48,000 to @entity94			1
' this was a woman who had certain high expectations and standards for her children and a sense that she was entitled to a particular standard of living and she was going to have it come what may			0
' you would either have to be colossally stupid or fraudulently dishonest to continue claiming benefits when you had £ 306,000 in the bank			1
' during the course of the alleged deceptions , he said , she transferred her money into @entity121 - a @entity3 bank with a branch in @entity123			1
' no doubt she was taking advantage of the notorious and well documented reluctance of the @entity126 to give out information about their bank accounts.the money went back to @entity131 , spirited away , no doubt , to be used by ms @entity9			2
' mr @entity38 said that when the alleged frauds were detected ms @entity9 was ' like a chameleon on a tartan hook ' not knowing which way to turn when questioned by investigators			2
her explanation was ' like a sort of fraudster 's equivalent of " the dog ate my homework " , ' he said			0
she claimed the money in the account was not hers and was needed by her ex husband in @entity147 to settle debts			0
she produced a document to support that claim but the prosecution alleged it was a false document , he went on			2
' what we have here is a woman who has been caught out and frankly she does n't like being caught out			0
she regards it as rather an affront that those perhaps less clever than her , less sophisticated than her , and less entitled than her , should have the right to pursue her			0
' and all this at a time when the poorest in society are having their entitlement to benefits cut from beneath them because of the austerity which affects all of us - but not her			0
' this is a case of someone using the benefits system as their own pocket money to help finance an already wealthy lifestyle			0
