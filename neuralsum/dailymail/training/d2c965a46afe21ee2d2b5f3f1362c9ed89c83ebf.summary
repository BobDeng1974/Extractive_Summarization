@entity0 has spent the past two years on treatment tables , in swimming pools , on weights and running machines , even in the stands scouting			1
the one place he has n’t been is a @entity8 football pitch			0
in fact , not since august 25 , 2012 , has his name appeared on a top - flight teamsheet			0
later that week , in a @entity14 match , @entity0 suffered a cruciate ligament injury			2
he did his rehabilitation and returned towards the end of the season			0
@entity21 's @entity0 , pictured in training on friday , could return to action on sunday @entity0 has lifted @entity21 's camp on his return to first team training , according to @entity27 @entity0 will be jumping with joy if he can make his first appearance of the season against @entity31 but before his anticipated comeback match , @entity0 was struck down in training with exactly the same injury			1
this time , though , the prognosis was not good – a year minimum on the sidelines			2
on sunday , some 26 months on from the initial damage , @entity0 is expected to take his place on the @entity21 bench at @entity31			1
his return is said to have provided even more of a boost to the squad than their first win of the season against @entity45 last weekend			0
for @entity0 , a cheeky @entity46 who scored the decisive goal in a @entity48 in 2011 , is a popular character			2
his team - mates have worn ‘ @entity58 ’ t - shirts in support of their stricken comrade , the design referencing the song dedicated to his free - kick winner against @entity57			0
and his manager , @entity27 , says the 30 - year - old ’s return has lifted his camp			2
‘ @entity0 ’s return is the story to come out of our training ground this week in my opinion , ’ he said			1
‘ i think it ’s an inspirational story to everybody here and everybody in football , because this is a guy who has had terrible , terrible luck with cruciate injuries and he has come back again			0
‘ it was so pleasing to put his name on the teamsheet this week to travel			0
that 's good news for us , because he is a very , very liked guy here			0
@entity27 is pleased to have @entity0 back in and around his squad following his return to fitness ‘ he commands great respect , not just with our fans , but within the training ground , his place of work			1
‘ for our coaches and our players , we know how unfortunate he has been but he still comes in with a positive smile on his face and does his rehab - can you imagine doing that three times ? ’ that third occasion mentioned by @entity27 was a horrific double leg break which @entity0 suffered playing for @entity103 ’s reserves – ironically , at @entity21 – in 2006			1
those injuries have limited the 30 - year - old to just 103 @entity8 appearances since signing for the @entity107 from @entity108 in 2005			0
but @entity0 has tried to earn his keep at @entity21 during the past couple of years by scouting opposition teams			1
indeed , his detailed dossiers boasted an unbeaten run when he first took on the role of super scout , and @entity27 was more than happy to let @entity0 offer guidance to individual players			1
@entity0 , pictured being carried off on a stretcher in february 2012 , will be hoping he is over his injury nightmare and the @entity21 boss added : ‘ he 's just a good person to have at the training ground			1
there 's been a lot of talk this week about professionalism at training grounds and what people bring			0
‘ what @entity0 brings is a real good knowledge and a good understanding , and also professionalism that can inspire others			2
’ meanwhile , owner @entity132 was spotted at @entity133 during @entity31 ’ 5 - 1 victory over @entity135 in the @entity14 on thursday			0
could he , then , be about to take on @entity0 ’s duty of opposition scout ? ‘ yes , maybe he is , ’ laughed @entity27			1
