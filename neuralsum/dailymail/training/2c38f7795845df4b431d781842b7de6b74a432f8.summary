@entity0 at the @entity2 house is going to be awkward this year			1
@entity2 , a former congresswoman and mother - in - law to former first daughter @entity4 , crashed and burned in a bid to return to the @entity6 on tuesday , losing her @entity8 primary in a landslide			1
her epic @entity11 loss to state rep. @entity12 came despite campaign fundraising appearances by both @entity14 and @entity15 , who could n't push her above a 27 per cent showing in a four - way race			1
@entity2 has courted controversy since 1993 when , in her first and only term in @entity20 , she cast the deciding vote in favor of then - president @entity24 's tax - raising 1993 budget			1
@entity2 conceded the election for the @entity8 nomination in @entity11 's 13th @entity27 on tuesday , losing in a landslide despite endorsements and fundraising help from @entity14 and @entity15 happy couple : @entity4 and @entity32 merged the two political families with troubled pasts , and @entity32 's mother 's political flame - out will add new tensions former secretary of state @entity15 turned an april fundraiser for @entity2 into a mini campaign launch for herself , raising $ 200,000 for her son - in - law 's mother but test - ballooning 2016 campaign issues at the same time republicans chanted ' bye bye @entity2 ' on the @entity6 floor , knowing her political life would take a hit since she had promised her constituents that she would never raise their taxes			1
shortly after she lost her seat in the 1994 midterm election that swept @entity52 and more than 50 other conservatives into power , she got a consolation prize in the form of a $ 600,000 grant for her charity , @entity58 , from @entity24 's @entity59			1
part of @entity2 ' political baggage was linked to that charity			2
in 2001 after her husband , former democratic rep. @entity63 , was indicted for investor fraud , @entity2 lost everything – her property was liquidated to reimburse her husband 's victims more than $ 10 million , and a judge refused to let her declare bankruptcy			1
she then doubled her own salary into six - figure territory , made a move to pay for a mansion for her to live in and billed it for a leased car			0
she also reportedly forced the charity 's staffers to double as personal assistants to help her at a university where she taught			0
a pregnant @entity4 showed off her baby bump as she arrived in @entity81 on wednesday ; her mother - in - law lost a congressional primary bid on tuesday @entity14 and @entity15 both personally headlined fundraisers for @entity2 , and they appeared together in a campaign commercial made near the end of the primary run			1
@entity15 's appearance in april , however , appeared less focused on @entity2 than on herself			2
the candidate did n't show up , and mrs. @entity4 road - tested campaign themes for the 2016 presidential election			2
in contrast , the power couple made nearly a dozen appearances last year in @entity95 to help former @entity97 chair @entity96 win a hotly contested governor 's race			0
a handful of other marquee november races took shape tuesday night as @entity43 seek a six - seat flip this year to retake the @entity104 @entity105 senate minority leader @entity106 cruised to victory over tea party challenger @entity108 , a political neophyte who never had a chance after he was caught speaking to a pro-cockfightnig rally			1
@entity114 was a gracious winner : he needs to be			0
facing popular state attorney general @entity117 in november will force the five - term incumbent to unite a fractured @entity43 , many of whose voters see him as a flexible moderate with limited conservative credentials			0
@entity117 hopes to unseat the @entity43 ' most powerful senator , even if it 's a consolation prize in an otherwise dismal year for @entity8			0
@entity4 and @entity32 wed in 2010 ; his mother @entity2 ( @entity126 ) lost her bid to return to @entity20 in a dramatic primary drubbing on tuesday @entity130 @entity43 @entity129 ( 2nd l ) won her @entity104 nomination despite separate domestic harassment accusations leveled against her in the past by an ex-husband and a former boyfriend ; early voting by mail helped her collect support before the scandal broke @entity141 in a hyper - competitive @entity104 race , businessman @entity142 topped the field of seven @entity43 and a more conservative @entity6 member , @entity145 , finished a close second			1
the two will meet in a july runoff for the @entity43 nomination			0
@entity114 cruises : the @entity104 minority leader , shown voting with nis wife -- former labor secretary @entity150 -- made easy work of his tea party challenger , and then quickly called for party unity in order to hold on to his seat in november @entity162 - supported candidates @entity163 and @entity164 , both members of the @entity6 who sought to leap to the @entity166 of the @entity167 , finished at the bottom of the heap and will likely exit @entity20 entirely			2
the winner of july ’s runoff election will face @entity8 nominee @entity172 , whose father @entity173 was a popular @entity167 senator who often won re-elections by landslide margins			0
@entity130 dr. @entity129 overcame late - stage accusations about past domestic disputes to capture the @entity43 @entity104 nomination			0
police reports surfaced this month showing that her ex-husband and a former boyfriend both called police with claims that she had harassed them			0
the boyfriend , a timber company executive who later funded a super pac attacking @entity129 's main challenger , state rep. @entity189 , and later said he regretted blowing the whistle on her , and that his claims at the time were heat - of - passion exaggerations @entity130 voters participate heavily in early mail - in voting , raising the possibility that @entity129 's victory was significantly aided by voters who cast ballots before her scandal broke in the news			2
but now the issue threatens to damage her chances against incumbent @entity8 sen. @entity207 in november .			0

@entity209 captured just 27 per cent of votes in a @entity11 congressional primary , despite endorsements from the @entity213
her son @entity32 is married to former first daughter @entity4
@entity2 served one term in @entity20 during the 1990s but was famously *bounced* from office after a single term following her deciding vote in favor of @entity24 's 1993 national tax increase
@entity225 primary races in @entity130 , @entity105 , @entity141 and elsewhere have *clarified* the november races that will determine who controls @entity20 during president @entity228 's final two years in office
