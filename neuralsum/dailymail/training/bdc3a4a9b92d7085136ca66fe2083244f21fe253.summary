by @entity0 four questions for @entity3 fans : 1 ) does @entity4 know how to get the best out of @entity6 ? my view : time will tell but the early signs are not convincing			1
@entity6 was desperate to play in a central role but when @entity12 dropped deeper after @entity13 moved to centre back at @entity14 , the whole system seemed confused			0
it made me wonder why @entity4 did n’t bring @entity17 on			1
@entity4 said @entity3 were the better team			1
surely @entity3 fans do n’t agree with that ? @entity4 will be scrutinised heavily as @entity3 manager – he better get used to it			1
and he ca n’t afford to say anything that might be interpreted as treating the club 's supporters like idiots			2
when you play with wingers you risk having nine players every game , especially if you trust @entity44 and @entity45 to deliver			0
@entity3 should be better than that			2
talking tactics : @entity6 ( left ) is being played out of position while @entity4 persists with @entity49 ( right ) 3 ) will @entity50 ever deliver ? my view : i honestly did n’t realise @entity50 was playing at @entity14 until the end of the first half when i saw him standing over an injured @entity54			1
he does n’t dominate midfield , he does n’t score , he does n’t spray passes around , there is no killer ball , he is no tough tackler and there is no dynamism in his game			2
when @entity13 left his side to fill in at centre half he was exposed			0
he ’s been given a fantastic opportunity to run @entity3 ’s midfield			2
but he is n’t taking that opportunity			2
4 ) @entity68 – is anybody sure yet ? at times i ’ve watched @entity68 play and felt confident he would go on to become an @entity73 regular			2
then there was saturday at @entity14 when i thought it would be just plain wrong to take him to the @entity77			0
his impact on the game at @entity14 was close to zero			0
as an @entity73 fan i want him ( and @entity50 ) to do well			2
but given a great opportunity he simply does n’t seem capable of leaving observers in no doubt that he really is the man to take @entity3 and @entity73 forward			1
please prove the sceptics wrong @entity68			0
jury 's out : neither @entity68 ( left ) nor @entity50 have convinced for @entity3 this season @entity90 and his scouting staff had 31 days of the transfer window to find a striker who ’s better than @entity94			1
astonishingly , they failed in that quest			0
maybe a world class striker was n’t available			2
but they were n’t looking for the best in the world , they were looking for someone better than @entity94			1
i wonder if the @entity107 scouts went to watch january opponents @entity108 in the @entity111 third round right at the start of the window			0
no deal : @entity90 opted not to sign a striker in the january transfer window if they did they would have seen not one but two strikers who are both better than @entity94			1
@entity120 and @entity121 both scored and played superbly at @entity122 ’s on january 4			1
you can look at the goals tally for both ( @entity120 22 all competitions , @entity121 15 ) but it ’s the variety of the goals they score , the intelligent running , the link up play			1
and @entity132 play very good football , they ’re not long - ball merchants			1
are players from @entity132 good enough for @entity107 ? it would be pompous and ignorant to suggest they ca n’t be			1
look at @entity138 if you disagree			0
technically brilliant , and he can finish			0
dynamic duo : @entity120 ( left ) and @entity142 ( right ) have set the @entity143 alight this season @entity120 and @entity121 are better than @entity94			1
so why did n’t @entity90 go for either of them ? £ 10million would be the maximum needed for either			0
maybe it 's because he has n’t got a clue about anything outside of the top flight in @entity73			1
i ’m talking about spotting players in the lower leagues , not signing heralded youngsters like @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156			0
i remember @entity107 winning a penalty shootout in the @entity158 against @entity159 in 2005 , and after the game @entity90 said he thought some of the @entity163 players would have a future in the @entity165			2
not one of them went on to play in the @entity169 top flight			0
clearly @entity90 ’s encyclopaedic football knowledge does n’t include the @entity171			1
that ’s a shame for @entity107 , because if you look closely , you ’ll see there are strikers down there who are clearly better than @entity94			1
out of @entity177 : @entity94 is @entity90 's only real alternative to first - choice @entity179 i was at @entity14 on saturday to watch them beat @entity3 2 - 1 , and it ’s good to see @entity181 rediscover his form since i questioned what he brings to the @entity165 a few weeks ago			1
his winning goal was a joy to commentate on and take nothing away from @entity14 , they deserved to win the game in my opinion			0
but referee @entity190 was guilty of blatant inconsistency during the game			0
at one end @entity14 ’s @entity193 had his arms around @entity197 ’s neck in the box – nothing given			0
minutes later @entity201 has his arms around @entity203 ’ waist , @entity190 gives a free - kick and @entity14 score the opening goal			0
the ref had a clear view of both and he simply can not give one decision and not give the other			0
penalised : @entity201 gave away the free - kick that led to @entity14 's opening goal why does n’t anyone talk about @entity214 for @entity73 ? is it because he ’s ginger ? how many gingers have worn the @entity73 with any success ? @entity219 in 1966 of course			1
but since then @entity221 scandalously won only 10 @entity73 caps , @entity223 quit @entity73 because he was being wasted on the left , and that ’s about it			2
i ’m not saying @entity214 should be picked because he ’s ginger			1
but he certainly should n’t be overlooked because of the colour of his hair			2
is he good enough ? he ’s better than @entity50 that ’s for sure			0
fine form : @entity214 has been outstanding for @entity232 since @entity233 took charge @entity235 holds a world record – when he was at @entity3 he went 1,311 minutes without conceding a goal in the @entity165			1
that record is under threat			0
@entity241 ’s @entity240 is currently on 1,035 minutes in the @entity242			1
but do n’t you think it would be an absolute scandal if @entity240 took that record off the @entity246 ? @entity241 are a heavyweight champ bossing the ring , seeing off a succession of flyweights week in , week out			1
every game is a mis - match for @entity241 , it will be an embarrassment if @entity240 does n’t break the record			1
it ’s no criticism of the @entity73 man – he ’s just doing his job			2
but it would be so wrong for a keeper at such a dominant club in such an uncompetitive league to take such glory			0
@entity246 master : @entity235 broke all manner of records as @entity3 goalkeeper on sunday , @entity240 broke @entity241 ’s clean sheet record when he shut out @entity267 , making it 11 in a row			1
@entity269 – a 5ft 6in keeper , @entity241 captain and legend - set the original record in 1922			2
@entity272 described @entity240 ’s achievement as ' a testament to him and the players in front of him			0
' really ? as @entity272 also said , @entity240 was n’t ' overly worked ' during the 1 - 0 win over @entity267			0
he ’s not been overly worked all season in the @entity242			1
@entity241 ’s wage bill is more than six times bigger than the next highest in the top flight north of the border			2
rangers are out of the picture , and there is no serious challenge			0
so any records broken by @entity241 at this time when the @entity242 is so moribund should be wiped from history			1
not only are they totally meaningless , they ’re an insult to those who worked so much harder to break the record previously			0
closing in : @entity241 and @entity73 goalkeeper @entity240 ( right ) has kept 11 clean sheets in a row we should all tip our hats to @entity297 , he studied @entity298 and he worked out a way to beat them			1
@entity301 were brilliant , and they did n’t need to park the bus			0
they could have scored five			0
there were plenty of 10 out of 10 performances among the @entity301 players in their 1 - 0 victory			0
@entity308 and @entity309 were imperious ; @entity310 showed @entity311 how it ’s done ; @entity313 was non-stop ; @entity314 was the match - winner			0
but only one man was 11 out of 10 and that was @entity318			2
he was simply stunning – strength with technique and end product , and i would happily pay good money to watch the @entity324			0
his role in the winning goal was fantastic			0
he ’s the kind of player you want to take your children to see just so they can say they saw him at his best			0
if people simply total up goals then @entity332 or @entity333 or maybe @entity334 will win @entity337			0
but for me @entity318 has been the best player in the @entity165 so far this season			1
stunning performance : @entity301 's @entity318 embarks on another mesmeric run how can a man facing charges of attempted embezzlement in @entity345 ( which he denies ) , with an arrest warrant issued for him stating he has ' marked criminal tendencies … capable of using every kind of deception to achieve his ends ' , get anywhere near the front door at @entity353 ? the @entity171 issued a statement on february 1 saying it was having ' conversations ' with @entity356 , the group led by @entity357			1
by that time the @entity345 had sacked @entity359 through his solicitor , signed a player ( @entity361 ) , and attempted to put the man he wanted to take over as manager ( @entity363 ) in the dugout for the game against @entity366 , he was already making decisions at @entity368			1
it 's absolutely pathetic from the @entity171 , which needs to take a long , hard look at itself			1
after what ’s happened at @entity368 in the past few days , you have to question whether the @entity165 is carrying out its duty of care to clubs			1
@entity359 deserves so much better , and so do the @entity368 fans			2
back in the hotseat : @entity359 was sacked then reinstated in a bizarre few days			0

surely @entity3 fans do *n't* agree with @entity4 ?
both @entity132 's strikers , @entity120 and @entity121 , are better than @entity94
it is good to see @entity181 rediscover his form after i criticised him
@entity214 should n’t be overlooked by @entity73 because he is ginger
any records broken by @entity241 at this time when the @entity242 is so moribund should be wiped from history
@entity318 has been the best player in the @entity165 this season
@entity171 have been pathetic in how they *'ve* handled @entity368 situation
