@entity0 will have the decisive say when @entity3 ’s executive committee vote on friday on whether to publish the full @entity5 report into @entity6 bid corruption			1
only six of the 25 - strong committee can be guaranteed to vote yes — @entity11 vice-president @entity10 , @entity13 ’s prince @entity12 , @entity15 president @entity14 , @entity17 president @entity16 , @entity18 of the @entity19 and @entity21 ’s @entity20 , who has put forward the motion calling for publication			2
but such is @entity3 president @entity0 ’s influence that his support for the motion would be enough to create a majority in favour			0
@entity3 's executive committee members are due to vote on the publication of @entity5 's corruption report @entity0 said only older ( pre 2010 ) members should be allowed to vote on the publication of the report @entity5 's ( left ) report was only published as a summary by @entity3 , something @entity5 himself quickly denounced norther @entity38 's @entity10 said @entity3 's reputation is completely at stake ahead of vote @entity42 ’s @entity10 said : ‘ @entity3 ’s reputation is completely at stake here and the only way this is going to be enhanced is by hopefully the @entity47 deciding that as much of the report as legally possible can be published			1
’ if they do so — following the bombshell resignation of @entity5 , in which he effectively accused @entity3 of mounting a cover - up of his findings — then some order can be restored to @entity3 ’s damaged house			0
failure to do so will lead to yet another outcry about a whitewash .			0

@entity47 will vote on friday on whether to publish @entity6 bid report
only six of the 25 - *man* committee are guaranteed to vote for publication
such is @entity0 's *infulence* that his support would be enough to create a majority in favour
