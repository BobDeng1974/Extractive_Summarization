every day we 're urged to be more and more energy conscious			0
but it has been revealed that wind farms were paid £ 8.7 million to switch off last month because there was n't enough demand for the energy they generated			1
and the @entity8 has been making the ' constraint payments ' for years , with £ 32 million paid in the last year to keep the turbines powered down			2
according to the @entity12 ( @entity13 ) , the ' largest monthly amount paid for wind farms not to generate ( £ 8.7 million ) ' was in march of this year			1
wind turbines were paid a record amount of money to shut down last month as they generated more electricity than was needed the turbines were shut down because , during periods of increased electricity generation and low - peak usage , there is not enough demand for energy			1
there is currently no adequate method to store the large amounts of energy they produce when it 's not being used , so the turbines must be turned off			0
the ' constraint payments ' are made to operators of various wind farms to stop them generating the surplus electricity			1
' wind farm constraints are essentially caused by difficulties in exporting excess wind electricity generated in @entity40 , ' the @entity13 states on their website			2
' in march 2014 approximately 12 per cent of the potential wind power output of large @entity40 grid connected wind farms had to be constrained off the system , thus incurring costs to the consumer in the form of constraint payments			1
' but the ref suggests that the wind industry is ' attempting to conceal the scale of this market abuse , by claiming that wind power receives less in constraint payments than conventional generation			1
' this is untrue , and fails to convey the significant distinction between payments to conventional generators to start generating , and additional payments to wind power to stop generating			0
' more tea ? the @entity8 claims it is necessary to pay operators to turn the turbines off to cope with periods of fluctuating demand according to the @entity8 , however , these payments are required to cope with periods of increased demand			1
' constraint payments are made when there is congestion on the network , ' a spokesperson for the @entity8 tells @entity75			2
' it 's a bit like with motorways , you get jams but you would n't necessarily build new motorways to eliminate the jams			0
' so using wind constraint payments we 're expecting that to work out as more cost - effective than building lots of new pylons and wires			2
' our job is to manage the electricity system minute by minute			0
' we choose whatever generation is the cheapest to constrain at a given time to keep costs as low as possible			0
' constraint payments can be made for any number of reasons , including high winds or parts of the grid being out for maintenance or improvement work			2
' the amount of constraint payments has increased considerably since march 2013 when they amounted to just £ 10,000			1
the @entity8 says this due to a number of factors including windier weather over the past year and more wind turbines coming online			0
but they hope to reduce constraint payments by increasing the capabilities of the network in the next two years			0
by 2016 they plan to complete the £ 1 billion @entity113 project ' that will have more than double the capacity from @entity40 to @entity115 from @entity116 in 2010 to @entity117 in 2016			0

a record £ 8.7m was paid to turn wind farms off last month
this compares to about £ 10,000 in march 2013
the so - called ' constraint payments ' were made by the @entity8 because too much electricity was being generated
the @entity12 claims the wind industry is ' attempting to conceal the scale of this market abuse '
but the @entity8 say it is a necessary measure to cope with periods of increased demand
