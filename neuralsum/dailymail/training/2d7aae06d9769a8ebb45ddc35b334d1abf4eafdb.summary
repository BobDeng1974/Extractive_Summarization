’ the base rate has been at an historic low of 0.5 per cent since march 2009			1
hikes would be welcomed by savers but would hit cash - strapped households who are borrowing at the highest levels for six years			0
a rate rise to 1 per cent would add £ 456 a year to a £ 150,000 variable rate mortgage			2
mr @entity9 said : ‘ there is definitely a feeling now that interest rates will start to rise			1
when the day comes there will be households holed below the water line , and they will be in trouble			0
‘ the problem is that there is a huge amount of household debt in the country			0
people have forgotten that 0.5 per cent is an emergency level of interest rates			1

’ the minutes of this month ’s meeting of the @entity39 showed that @entity21 and @entity22 voted for rates to rise to 0.75 per cent immediately			1
the pair argued that ‘ the continuing rapid fall in unemployment ’ to a six - year low of 6.4 per cent , or 2.08million , and the likelihood that wage growth will pick up later this year , meant rates should rise			2
