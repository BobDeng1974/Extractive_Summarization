hundreds of infants and toddlers have reportedly been captured by border officers after crossing into the @entity3 illegally from @entity4 unaccompanied by an adult as a growing number of migrants from @entity8 overwhelm detention centers in @entity10			1
the @entity3 @entity11 detained 378 children aged two or less who were traveling without a parent or guardian from oct 1 through june 11 , according to data obtained by fusion from the office of a high - ranking @entity20 senator who was n't identified			1
of those , 95 were under a year old			0
parents may be sending their wee ones across the border in hopes they will be allowed to stay , fueled in part by misconceptions among migrants that people with children can enter the @entity3 legally			1
children detainees sleep in a holding cell at a @entity34 processing facility in @entity35 , @entity10 , earlier this month the federal government will spend more than $ 1 billion this year feeding , clothing and otherwise babysitting the children until suitable adult guardians can be found			1
@entity40 claims 85 per cent of them are reunited with family members , but those are guardians in the @entity3 , not in their home countries			0
the agency has not responded to requests for information about how many of them are themselves illegal aliens			0
the growing number of immigrants trying to make it into the @entity3 is being driven in part by a misconception that children wo n't be deported			2
that 's a misinterpretation of a 2012 policy that delays the deportation of illegal immigrants brought to the @entity3 as children prior to 2007			1
still , unaccompanied children are more likely than adults to slip through the cracks and ultimately remain in the @entity3 for months or even years			1
once captured , most minors are processed and reunited with family members or a guardian in the @entity3 while they await deportation proceedings			1
detention facilities are generally not equipped to handle young people , especially infants and toddlers			2
but because of the significant backlog and lack of resources put into tracking them , few are expected to ever return and face immigration judges			0
few of the children are expected to return to face immigration judges , according to the nation 's largest border patrolman 's union			2
in 2012 president @entity83 announced a policy intended to delay the deportation of illegal immigrants who were brought to the @entity3 as children before 2007			2
but in a transnational game of ' telephone ' , that policy has been misinterpreted – in some cases willfully so , by ' coyotes ' who make a living transporting immigrants into the @entity3 – to suggest that it would apply equally to newly arriving minors			0
rumors also persist that the @entity3 will pass immigration reform that will grant migrants already within its borders amnesty and a right to remain			0
the steady stream of tens of thousands of unaccompanied children is part of a recent surge in @entity8 crossing into the @entity3 via the @entity105 in @entity10			1
about 174,000 people have been arrested by the @entity11 there since oct 1 , including 52,000 children - a 99 per cent increase from last year			1
most of the migrants hail from @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			0
the average age of an unaccompanied child is 14 , according to @entity117 , a senior program officer at the @entity118			0
the @entity119 is trying to address the problem by combating the misinformation and opening new detention facilities designed for families in an effort to process and deport them more quickly			1
the first one will be located on the @entity127 's @entity126 , @entity4 , campus , according to @entity128			0
at the moment , the @entity11 is releasing many of them while they await their deportation proceedings because there is no place to hold them , making it easier for them to blend into the population and remain for years			1
@entity34 agents escort young detainees primarily from @entity8 to an area to make phone calls the immigration agency currently has only one detention center designed for families , an 85 - bed facility in @entity143			2
the rising number of migrants have overwhelmed @entity3 authorities at the @entity3 's busiest corridor for crossings in @entity10 , forcing them to seek out additional detention space			1
a plan to bus hundreds to an empty college campus in @entity153 , @entity154 , was scrapped after a community backlash , according to @entity156			0
the government is also trying to ease agents ' workload by flying hundreds of migrants to @entity162 for processing , the @entity157 reported			0
two flights on monday will ferry about 140 @entity8 migrants to @entity166 and a nearby town , according to @entity168 , chief of the @entity11 for the @entity162 city			1
a toddler sits on the floor with other detainees at the @entity34 processing facility in @entity35 , @entity10 , on wednesday the flights are expected to continue every three days , primarily filled with families with young children , but no unaccompanied minors			2
neither plan , however , will help address the growing number of children making the perilous journy across the border alone			0
vice president @entity183 met with @entity8 leaders in @entity114 on friday in hopes of discouraging minors from making the voyage and emphasizing that traveling with children does not give migrants a free pass			1
vice president @entity183 visited @entity114 on friday in an effort to stem the tide of @entity8 children and families crossing into the @entity3 illegally ' we are prioritizing the need to resolve these cases … in light of the humanitarian crisis caused by the number of crossings , ' mr @entity183 said			2
' make no mistake , once an individual 's case is fully heard , and if he or she does not qualify for asylum , he or she will be removed from the @entity3 and returned home			0
' detainees wait in a holding cell at the @entity35 detention center that was part of a media tour the @entity216 hosted			0
