the @entity0 , which was one of @entity3 's flagship announcements in the last budget , is due to be launched on july 1 banks and building societies are slashing savers ’ @entity9 interest rates by up to 40 per cent – just weeks before the launch of the chancellor ’s flagship @entity13 savers are set to miss out on hundreds of pounds a year as high street names including @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 rush to cut cash @entity9 rates to avoid big interest payouts			1
under current rules , savers can put up to £ 11,880 into a tax - free @entity27 ( @entity0 ) each year , but only half of this can be in cash – the rest must be made up of stocks and shares			1
but the new super-charged @entity9 – to be launched on july 1 – will allow savers to put in up to £ 15,000 cash a year			1
it will also be made easier to transfer balances from one @entity27 to another			0
the policy was one of the @entity3 ’s flagship announcements in the last budget			0
however , just three weeks before it launches , banks and building societies are pushing down rates to avoid paying extra interest on the new bigger allowance			1
around 16million people hold cash isas			0
around 2.7million invest only in share isas and 4.4million have savings in both			0
@entity54 has chopped the rate by a fifth for new savers , cutting its easy - access @entity57 from 1.25 per cent to 1 per cent			2
on monday , rival @entity18 will slash interest on its two - year fixed rate cash @entity60 to 1.5 per cent			1
just weeks ago , it was 2 per cent			0
payouts are falling even more sharply at @entity63			0
it now pays new savers opening an account just 0.75 per cent , down from 1.25 per cent – so someone who saved the full £ 15,000 in a @entity0 for a year would get just £ 112.50 in annual interest			1
others to cut rates for new savers include @entity70 , part of the @entity72 , and @entity73			1
dr @entity74 , a savings expert and former @entity76 adviser , said : ‘ this outrageous behaviour shows how , once again , savers are being hung out to dry			0
‘ savers have been suffering for five years since base rate had to be cut because of banks ’ behaviour			1
and now here they are again – still being made to pay in the shape of rate cuts for their @entity0 savings			2
’ the rate - cutting has left millions of savers who are sitting on their cash waiting for a top @entity0 deal in limbo – often earning a paltry rate of less than 1 per cent			1
figures from the @entity94 showed that sums held in cash @entity9 deposits in april , usually the biggest month for attracting new money , fell by a record £ 2.8billion to £ 226billion			2
part of the problem for savers is that banks and building societies do n’t want to be at the top of @entity106 tables as it means they will attract funds they do n’t want			2
having lots of savers costs banks money because they must pay them interest			1
this has increasingly led to a race to the bottom of the savings tables			0
additionally , some of the remaining best deals are already closed to transfers , blocking savers from moving money held in a low - paying cash @entity0 into a better deal			1
for example , @entity126 ’s easy - access @entity9 at 1.75 per cent interest is only for current account holders and does not accept transfers			2
other top deals including the @entity132 paying 1.5 per cent , and @entity134 and @entity135 building societies offering 1.6 per cent , will not let customers switch in cash from existing @entity138			0
@entity139 , a spokesman at financial analysts @entity140 said : ‘ the launch of the @entity0 is set to be a damp squib			0
‘ banks and building societies have no appetite whatsoever for savers ’ cash – they just do n’t need it			2
the best we can hope for is a small rate rise from one bank to try and spark some competition for savers – but it just does n’t look like it at the moment			0
’ the dearth of decent deals just 23 days ahead of the @entity0 ’s introduction is the latest bad news for savers hoping for rising rates			1
they have suffered after more than five years of the @entity94 keeping the base rate at just 0.5 per cent – with no sign of a significant rise on the horizon			0
@entity94 governor @entity167 recently dampened expectations of a rate rise by suggesting falling unemployment did not necessarily mean rates would go up .			0

savers will miss out on hundreds of pounds as high street banks cut rates
@entity0 allows £ 15,000 cash to be deposited each year - it 's now £ 5,900
