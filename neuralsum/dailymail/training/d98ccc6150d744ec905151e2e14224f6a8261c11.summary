by @entity0 published : 11:52 est , 26 march 2013 updated : 12:04 est , 26 march 2013 what if darkness overtook our world and just a single source of light remained to pierce the gloom ? that 's the question photographer @entity8 asked himself when he came up with the concept for this series of dramatic pictures , entitled after @entity13			1
the @entity15 photographer travelled the world to capture these eerie images , which are completely devoid of all artificial light but from a single source hidden behind a window			1
haunting : this eerie image , which could be of a haunted house , is part of a set entitled after lights out by @entity15 photographer @entity8 after the zombie apocalypse : the @entity15 photographer travelled the world to capture these eerie images , which are completely devoid of all artificial light but from a single source hidden behind a window lucky find : this photo , photo which shows a single light shining from a grand building seen over @entity36 's @entity35 , was shot just as mr @entity8 found it			1
others required complex camera trickery chilling : in this shot he has used an off - camera flash triggered remotely to create the single source of light at just the moment the picture was taken on his website , he explains how he was inspired to come up with the series by inescapable light pollution			1
' night no longer exists , ' he says			0
' city lights cover up the stars , and cell phone screens lighten even the darkest of alleyways			0
' and soon , imagine a world in which our lights render even the sun gratuitous			2
' in the darkness of space , light is a beacon of hope			2
what if darkness in our world once again overtook the night and as an affect , transforming even the most insignificant light into an exception â€“ a mystical phenomenon ? ' in a world in black and blue , the single incandescence of a bulb could be the greatest promise of an adventure about to start			2
' serendipity : mr @entity8 told how the old woman in this shot arrived just at the right moment and stood perfectly still as the photograph was exposed			2
she then disappeared as mysteriously as she arrived edited : this image shows @entity81 , @entity82			0
most of the lights in the windows of the buildings pictured have been carefully darkened using photoshop @entity88 : @entity89 of a jogger running in front of council estate - style blocks of flats was actually taken during the day with the night - time effect the result of a low shutter speed and @entity99 setting all the photographs were shot with a @entity101 , a high - spec @entity102 digital slr aimed at the so - called ' prosumer ' market of dedicated amateurs			1
however , except for a few lucky finds , many of the haunting images required careful composition and a touch here and there of computer photo editing to get the desired effect			1
in some of the shots , mr @entity8 told @entity115 , he has used an off - camera flash triggered remotely to create the single source of light at just the moment the shot was taken			1
in others , he has used @entity87 to remove the lights in the scene			0
the photo which shows a single light shining from a grand building seen over @entity36 's @entity35 river was shot just as mr @entity8 found it			1
remote : all the photographs were shot with a @entity101 , a high - spec @entity102 digital slr aimed at the so - called ' prosumer ' market of dedicated amateurs labour of love : mr @entity8 says the effect of light is a major influence on his photography a forgotten world : the images hark back to an era when nightfall cast the world into inescapable darkness the @entity145 phonebox seen in another of his images was another such stroke of luck , with the old lady standing nearby having simply entered the frame and remained there still as the photo was exposed			1
half a minute later , she disappeared as mysteriously as she arrived			0
other photos required complicated camera trickery			0
for example , the image of a jogger running in front of council estate - style blocks of flats , which was n't shot at night at all			0
instead mr @entity8 set up his flash in the scene , lowered his camera 's colour temperature then exposed the photo with a very fast shutter speed and low iso setting			2
strange : a light source emanates mysteriously from the wreckage of a shipping boat in this ghostly image quick learner : mr @entity8 began considering photography seriously only three years ago apparition : a barely discernible figure stares back from the window in this unsettling image crumbling : this final photo shows a rural home , with another ghostly figure within staring back at the camera mr @entity8 , 28 , is from @entity188 , where he works as a digital project manager			1
' as long as i can remember i have always had a camera in my hand , but going from @entity195 to @entity196 took me quite a few years , ' he said			0
' i started to consider photography seriously only three years ago , while practicing on friends , landscapes and objects , trying to understand and apprehend natural lights			0
' at these times i progressively found myself very interested by scenaristic photographs , being influenced by the work of people such as @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 or @entity211			0
' later on , in 2011 , i began my first photography project with the will to experiment artificial lights			0
