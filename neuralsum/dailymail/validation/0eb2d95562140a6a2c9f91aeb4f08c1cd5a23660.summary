the name you use to refer to the @entity3 terror group can reveal whether you are a supporter or opponent of the jihadi organisation , according to a new study			1
research has revealed those who call the organisation as ' @entity3 ' overwhelmingly support it , while those who refer to it by its abbreviated name , @entity14 , are mostly opposed to it			1
not only does it reveal an individual 's @entity14 leanings , but researchers were also able to develop a model which accurately predicted future support of the terrorists			1
those who refer to the jihadi group by its full name ' @entity3 ' overwhelmingly support it , while those who call it ' @entity14 ' mostly oppose it , researchers have revealed this was only made possible due to @entity14 's widespread use of social media - unparalleled in modern conflicts - in attempting to recruit would - be jihadis from across the globe			1
the @entity34 analysed 123million @entity36 tweets by 57,000 @entity38 users to reveal common traits among those in the pro or anti camps			1
the remarkable results showed 93 per cent of those referring to the group by its full name @entity3 were supporters , while 73 per cent calling it @entity14 were opposed			1
the tweets used to determine support and opposition to the group were taken from mid-october to the end of december last year			2
during this time , former @entity54 ranger @entity53 was beheaded , while the jihadis carried out numerous other atrocities against locals within their territory			0
alarmingly , the results showed there was increasing support for the group on @entity38 during the three month time period			0
the report stated : ' anti-isis tweets generally peaked when news of @entity14 human rights violations emerged such as the killing of hostages , accounts of torture , or reports of the enslavement of @entity75 women			2
' on the other hand , @entity77 tweets generally peaked in conjunction with the release of propaganda videos and major military achievements			0
' they added : ' it seems that the top interests of both groups are rather different , except for one incident when an @entity14 affiliate group attacked the @entity89 in @entity90			2
' @entity14 brutality , according to the study , tended to galvanise opposition against the group and it was ' unclear ' if it was effective recruitment tool			2
the researchers then looked further ahead			0
using those accounts identified as pro or @entity99 according to how they referred to the group , they could determine - with 87 per cent accuracy - who was likely to become a supporter in future based on their use of hashtags from four years ' previous			1
hashtags relating to the @entity110 , or ongoing conflicts within the @entity113 world , showed those who were opposed to overturned political leaders were more likely to become @entity14 supporters			1
' looking at discriminating hashtags suggested that a major source of support for @entity14 stems from frustration with the missteps of the @entity110 , ' researchers concluded			1
' as for opposition to @entity14 , it is linked with support for other rebel groups , mostly in @entity127 , that have been targeted by @entity14 , support for existing @entity131 regimes , and @entity133 sectarianism			0
' researchers also revealed the ranked locations of the most pro and @entity138 tweets			0
in first place , for both those expressing support and opposition to the militants , was @entity144 , where the militants self - proclaimed capital in @entity147 is based			0
all the top 10 locations were confined to the @entity149 , with the exception of @entity151 , which placed 7th on the rankings of most @entity138 sentiment			0
@entity144 , followed by @entity154 and @entity127 , were the top three countries identified as hotbeds of @entity38 users anti-isis tweets came from similar countries to those of a supportive nature			0
however , none of the @entity165 countries made the list , while @entity167 came second and the @entity151 was ranked seventh			0
