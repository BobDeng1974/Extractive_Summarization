change of approach : @entity1 , assistant secretary for infrastructure protection at @entity3 says the agency is also looking at environmental threats , not just terror they 're tasked with protecting the @entity8 from terrorists and keeping @entity8 's biggest cities safe , but @entity3 's brief appears to be widening to include more global issues like climate change			1
the department that was created by president @entity15 in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks says that the role of the organization is ' to assist in the wake of disasters , whether they be man - made or natural '			1
however , claims of ' mission - creep ' are now being hurled at the department which is attempting to redefine its role as one of emergency management than of protection and security against enemies of the state			2
throughout it 's 13 year existence , there has been persistent criticisms the department is wasteful , ineffective and has been far from transparent in how the agency is run , and how money is spent on a day - to - day basis			2

in the aftermath of 2012 's @entity50 , which devastated large swathes of the @entity53 said her department reviewed the task of rebuilding with a new focus on ' how to think about baking in resilience from the get - go ' the @entity3 now has a team of specialists , including city planners , in conjunction with the @entity63 to develop better tools for planning ' increasingly , we 've moved not only from a security focus to a resiliency focus , ' said @entity1 , speaking at a panel at the @entity70 , a three - day conference organized by the @entity8 - based @entity72 to discuss tools and ideas on building resiliency , particularly against rising sea levels			1
in the aftermath of 2012 's @entity50 , which devastated large swathes of the @entity79 and caused over $ 60 billion in damages , @entity1 said her department reviewed the task of rebuilding with a new focus on ' how to think about baking in resilience from the get - go			0
' now a team of specialists , including city planners , along with a partnership from the @entity63 to develop better tools for planning , are part of her team			1

extra help : the @entity3 already has launched regional efforts to assess resilience of infrastructure and judge where gaps in adaptation and preparedness may be new targets ? a protester dressed as a polar bear dances in the streets during the ' @entity109 ' last weekend the city is still recovering from the effects of the storm , which flooded most of its extensive shoreline , left tens of thousands without electricity for days , did billions of dollars of damage to infrastructure and killed 44 people , he said			1
