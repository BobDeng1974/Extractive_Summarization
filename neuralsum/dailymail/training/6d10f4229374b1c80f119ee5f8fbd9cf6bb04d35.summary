an annual levy of up to £ 140,000 a year must now be paid on @entity30 homes which are registered to a company , along with a special stamp duty rate of 15 per cent when a property is sold			1
the @entity44 has reaped much more income than expected from the new fees , in a sign that the wealthy may be happy to pay extra tax on a property in return for privacy or other benefits that come from property ownership through a company			0

@entity26 pad : meanwhile , @entity64 singer sir @entity18 has a house ( pictured ) in @entity66 owned by a @entity68 - registered company called @entity69 this is apparently for ' privacy and security reasons ' the higher stamp duty rate brought in an additional £ 70 million in its first year ( 2012 - 13 )			1

most of the owners of the luxury @entity26 homes at one @entity105 , @entity30 ’s most expensive property development , are owned by offshore companies – as are the £ 35 million - plus homes in exclusive @entity109 , overlooking @entity110			2

the charges are only imposed on homes which are occupied by the beneficiaries of companies			2
homes owned by property firms and rented out to tenants are exempt			0
the lowest @entity58 charge in 2013 - 14 was £ 15,000 for homes worth £ 2 million to £ 5 million , but the highest rate was £ 140,000 for homes worth more than £ 20 million			2
the stamp duty rate of 15 per cent was imposed in march 2012 on company purchases of homes worth more than £ 2 million , compared to seven per cent for individuals buying homes in the same price bracket			1
the threshold for the tax was reduced to £ 500,000 in march this year			0
previously , such homes would have been virtually exempt from stamp duty if an individual buying the property simply bought the ownership of the company , paying a rate of just 0.5 per cent			1
foreigners also had the incentive of registering their homes in the name of offshore companies to avoid paying @entity30 inheritance tax rates of 40 per cent when they died			0

@entity174 , a real estate tax partner for accountants @entity176 , likened the three new tax levies to a ‘ back - door ’ version of the annual one per cent mansion tax , proposed by @entity182 ’s @entity181 for all properties worth more than £ 2 million			0
he added : ‘ @entity184 tinkering with the tax rules is a source of concern for foreign investors who want to see stability			0
