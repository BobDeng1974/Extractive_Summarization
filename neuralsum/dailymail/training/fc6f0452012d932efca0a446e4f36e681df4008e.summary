@entity0 is backing plans to potentially put astronauts in a deep sleep during manned missions to @entity5			1
the proposal would see a crew ‘ hibernate ’ for up to 180 days , allowing them to make the journey of 350 million miles ( 560 million km ) with a reduced need for food and water			1
the crew would be kept alive through intravenous feeding , before being woken at their destination by inhalation of a coolant gas			2
putting a crew into deep sleep means they would need less food and water			1
shown here is what the stasis system might look like			0
an ' arm ' helps care for the astronauts dr @entity35 from @entity36 in @entity37 suggested the proposal at the @entity20 in @entity21 last week			0
he explained how astronauts could be put in ‘ therapeutic torpor ’ - a state of reduced physiological activity - to reduce their needs for the 90 - to 180 - day mission to @entity5			1
electrical impulses would stimulate the muscles of the astronauts while hibernating , ensuring that when they woke from their slumber they were not significantly weakened			0
to put astronauts in stasis , a system called @entity52 would be used , which reduces body temperature by about one degree per hour by supplying coolant through the nose			1
at a temperature of between @entity63 ( 89 ° f and 93 ° f ) , which takes six hours to reach , the crew would enter stasis			2
stopping the flow of coolant would then wake the crew when they arrive at their destination			1
this means that on the journey to @entity5 , they could be placed in a fairly small capsule			2
therapeutic torpor has been around , in theory , since the 1980s and since 2003 it has been a staple for critical care trauma patients in hospitals			1
it is not typically used for longer than a week			0
this would mean that , en route , the crew could be crammed into a smaller area with less cargo , meaning the spacecraft would not have to be as big as those referenced in other proposals			0
‘ therapeutic torpor has been around , in theory , since the 1980s and really since 2003 it has been a staple for critical care trauma patients in hospitals , ’ said dr @entity35 , reports @entity90			2
he added : ‘ we have n’t had the need to keep someone in [ therapeutic torpor ] for longer than seven days			2
‘ for human @entity5 missions , we need to push that to 90 days , 180 days			2
' those are the types of mission flight times we ’re talking about			0
’ @entity98 reduces the metabolic needs for a human , essentially placing them in ' hibernation '			0
to put them in stasis , a system called @entity52 would be used , which reduces body temperature by about one degree per hour by supplying coolant through the nose			1
dr @entity35 says the @entity52 system , shown here , could put astronauts into a deep sleep			1
it is currently used to keep patients stable who have gone into cardiac arrest			0
it involves pumping coolant into their nose to lower their body temperature , decreasing their bodily functions until proper treatment can arrive some proposals suggest the habitat could also spin , providing artificial gravity and reducing bone and muscle loss for the astronauts			1
in this case the habitat might be a cylinder , shown , with the astronauts on one side to experience the force of gravity putting a crew in hibernation means the spacecraft designed to take them there could be smaller ( illustration shown ) , cutting weight requirements from 400 tons to 220 tons			0
the crew would be put to sleep for the 180 - day journey to @entity5 by lowering their body temperature through their nose getting to @entity5 is difficult due to the vast distances involved			1
the distance varies dramatically depending on where @entity152 and @entity5 are in their orbits			0
at their closest they are as little as 36 million miles ( 58 million km ) apart , but at their furthest they can be 250 million miles ( 400 million km )			0
the way to get to @entity5 using the minimum energy involves launching in a specific window when the two planets are aligned in such a way that a craft can catch up to the red planet when launched from @entity152 and enter orbit			1
this launch window opens approximately every two years and two months , which is why mission to @entity5 often launch and arrive at similar times – such as @entity170 ’s recent @entity5 orbiter and @entity0 ’s @entity172 mission			1
the next window opens in april 2018 , when @entity0 ’s next @entity5 mission – insight – will launch towards the red planet , while the as - yet unnamed @entity5 2020 rover will do the same when the next window opens in july 2020			1
at a temperature of between @entity63 ( 89 ° f and 93 ° f ) , which takes six hours to reach , the crew would enter stasis			0
stopping the flow of coolant would then wake the crew when they arrive at their destination			2
this means that on the journey to @entity5 , they could be placed in a fairly small capsule			2
in fact , the study by @entity36 suggests it could be five times smaller than a comparable spacecraft in which the astronauts were n't in stasis			0
and they would need three times less cargo including food and water to survive			0
in total , this could cut the weight requirements of such a mission from 400 tons to about 220 tons			0
upon arriving they would perform the key science of their mission , before being put in stasis again for the journey home			2
some proposals suggest the habitat could also spin , providing artificial gravity and reducing bone and muscle loss for the astronauts			0
an alternative would be to have the crew on hibernation ‘ shifts ’ , with one person staying awake for two or three days before hibernating for 14 days			0
more research is needed before the proposal is accepted as a viable option by @entity0			0
in the future , it a crew would go to sleep in @entity152 orbit - and wake up 180 days later in orbit around the red planet			1
the crew will likely be taken to and from a future ship to @entity5 aboard the @entity232 spacecraft ( illustrated )			2
in december this year @entity232 will complete its first unmanned test flight			0
@entity0 intends to use it to take humans to an asteroid in the 2020s and to @entity5 in the 2030s during interplanetary transit , the crew would receive low - level electrical impulses ( illustrated ) to key muscle groups to prevent muscles wasting away while in hibernation			1
an optimal crew size for a mission to @entity5 may be six people , as seen here , with the future @entity232 spacecraft likely able to carry a crew of this size once they had performed their scientific objects , potentially on the surface ( illustration shown ) , they would be put to sleep again for the return home			1
the study was backed by @entity0 but the agency has not yet decided if it will use such a technique on future manned missions to @entity5 or not			1

expert claims ' therapeutic torpor ' could make mission to @entity5 more feasible
this is a form of deep sleep , also referred to as a type of ' hibernation '
the crew would be put to sleep for the 180 - day journey to @entity5 by lowering their body temperature through their nose
they would then be woken by stopping the flow of coolant at the red planet
once mission was complete , they *'d* be put to sleep again for the return trip
the study was backed by @entity0 , but the agency has not yet decided if it will use such a technique on future manned missions to @entity5 or not
