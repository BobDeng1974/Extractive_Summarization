@entity0 has rubbed salt in @entity3 ’ wounds by insisting they are currently no match for @entity6 or @entity7 — let alone @entity8			1
@entity10 ’s side eased to a @entity12 showdown with @entity7 on march 15 after comfortably seeing off the @entity14 men 2 - 0 on sunday			1
in what was widely regarded as the most one - sided derby in history , the @entity16 leaders progressed to the showpiece without the need for @entity22 to make a meaningful save			1
@entity0 says that @entity3 deserve to be in the @entity16 but are n't better than many teams given @entity3 ’ championship status , @entity0 acknowledged he and his @entity8 colleagues were only doing what was expected of them			1
he believes that if their greatest rivals claim a @entity16 place in time for next season , they will struggle to usurp the teams currently sitting second and fourth in the table , either side of @entity34			1
‘ @entity3 should be in the @entity16 because they still have some decent players , ’ said the @entity35			1
‘ but i think , right now , @entity6 and @entity7 are better teams			1
’ asked if he was surprised at @entity8 ’s domination of their old foes , @entity0 replied : ‘ not really			1
obviously , we should be better			2
i think the first goal was really important and , once we went 2 - 0 up , that was it			1
‘ they stayed with the same tactics and dropped back			2
we still managed to find spaces between their back four , though			2
‘ in the first 10 minutes , we started with a really good tempo			2
we were speaking with each other during the whole game to stay focused			2
we knew if they scored and made it 2 - 1 , it could have been different — but i felt really comfortable			1
‘ they maybe had one shot or cross that was a bit dangerous , but that was it			0
we made it difficult for @entity3 and we wanted to score more goals , but you also do n’t want to concede anything			1
’ hoops striker @entity57 ( 28 ) heads his side into the lead on ten minutes and sends them on their way victory in the first derby in three years was just the first assignment of a defining period for @entity8			1
a trip to @entity66 in the @entity67 awaits on saturday , with home and away clashes against @entity69 in the @entity70 the tasty appetisers for a @entity16 clash with @entity6 at @entity73 on march 1			1
‘ february is a big month for us , ’ @entity0 added			1
‘ we are in the @entity12 and still in every competition			0
we just need to be ready			0
‘ we have been strong recently and not conceded many goals			0
if we are strong defensively , we will be good in attack , too			0
we are looking better every week			0
‘ we will get asked questions because @entity6 have been winning , but we have to focus on our game			1
if we play to the level we know we can , we should be able to beat teams			2
’ even before @entity57 ’ header laid the foundations for the most perfunctory of wins , it was apparent @entity87 ’s chances of semi-final success were about as high as the man who seeks to scoop the lottery without first buying a ticket			0
shorn of quality , the @entity3 caretaker manager had little option but to load his midfield , sit deep and limit the space in which @entity8 ’s fleet - footed front four could operate			1
@entity98 ( 15 ) celebrates after scoring @entity8 's second goal and is mobbed by his team - mates the pay - off was that veteran @entity102 spent much of the game operating in a different postcode from his team - mates			1
his withdrawal to a deeper role at the interval , with substitute @entity108 thrown further forward , proved about as threatening as a pop gun			0
@entity8 keeper @entity22 could have kept goal in his dinner suit without so much as a thought for dry cleaning			2
‘ @entity3 played how we thought they might , trying to get men behind the ball and looking to hit us on the counter-attacks with a more direct ball , ’ said @entity22			2
‘ they were just looking for one of them to fall kindly			0
it does n’t take a great deal of luck for that to work , a misplaced header or whatever it might be , and they have a chance			0
but it did n’t work out for them			0
‘ we dealt with it fairly well and read whatever they tried			0
‘ when @entity108 came on , he made things a bit more difficult , winning a few more balls			0
but we managed to read the flick - ons and not give them any chances			2
’ the players clash in a highly - heated match between the two @entity139 rivals in the @entity12 semi-finals down the years , @entity8 ’s goalkeepers have had to become familiar with long periods of inactivity on those occasions where the front line are engaged with putting cannon fodder to the sword			1
in such circumstances , complacency can creep in			0
‘ i made sure i kept my concentration , ’ added @entity22 , now a veteran of the @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 derbies			0
‘ from the start , i was looking to dominate my box and come to take any balls coming in			0
i knew that if we gave away free - kicks , they would be looking to put us under pressure			2
‘ that was my mindset — to be aggressive , come for crosses and aim to take the pressure off us			0
‘ we were comfortable in the game			0
it was about us controlling what we could and trying to play football on what was a difficult surface			0
