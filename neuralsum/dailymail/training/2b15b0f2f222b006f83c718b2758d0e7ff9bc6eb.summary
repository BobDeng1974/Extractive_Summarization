@entity0 is ' fed up ' with @entity2 's mentality and player selection , as the former @entity2 winger lays into @entity6 's side after their @entity8 defeat			1
@entity2 are as good as out after losing both their @entity11 matches , with their latest loss coming courtesy of an unfit @entity15			1
the @entity17 striker scored twice to gift his side a 2 - 1 win , and @entity0 feels @entity2 ' never ever learn ' when it comes to the @entity22			1
' the biggest problem is - when you think about it - the @entity53			1
' they have a product which they sell around the world which is entertaining but it 's doing our players no good whatsoever			1
' this is a @entity53 side basically we played			2
and it 's supposed to be the best league in the world			2
' and you 're telling me all them @entity70 players would get many teams in the world , apart from @entity15 , who was only 75 per cent fit by the way ? ' @entity75 possibly ? apart from that , who else is there ? ' and we go banging a drum about we 've got this , we 've got that			0
you know what makes the @entity53 exciting ? ' the players like @entity15 - the foreign players			1
we hype all our players up massive , as we always do			0
and we say we 've got this , we 've got that			0
' look at their back four			0
that kid who played centre - half , he 's played two games for @entity96 , he 's not even had a cap			2
still , they know how to win games			0
' @entity101 's verdict : ' the biggest problem is - when you think about it - the @entity53 ' and @entity0 went on to say @entity2 are misguided in their @entity53 top dogs approach			1
' it 's not about picking your star players , and he plays for @entity17 , he plays for @entity110 , it 's about getting a balance of a side which is going to get you a result , ' he added			2
' and we never ever do			0
' the media is to blame as much as anyone else , because when they drop somebody or they play somebody in a different position , we 're on the case straight away			0
' other countries go " you know what ? i 've got good players but unfortunately so - and - so is going to sit on the bench tonight " , and are we bothered ? no. ' until we get that way of thinking , how do you win football matches ? ' you start from the back , then you get organised			2
' and if you 've got two or three creative players , you build a side around certain players			0
' and that gets your side balanced			0
it 's not about having the best 11 players you can find , and we never ever ever learn			0
' @entity2 's final game of @entity11 is against @entity142 on tuesday			1
in action : @entity0 playing for @entity2 in 1990 , and the experienced winger thinks they ' never ever learn '			1

@entity0 says he 's ' fed up with the same old problems ' as @entity148 winger criticises @entity53 selection
@entity2 lost 2 - 1 to @entity8 , leaving them as good as out in @entity11
