by @entity0 published : 18:31 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 01:46 est , 11 july 2013 healthier : a study has shown that men and women in their 90s are sharper today than those who reached the same age a decade ago if you seem to be spending more and more time fretting about your pension , here ’s something to cheer you up			1
not only are we living longer , we are also getting wiser			2
an authoritative study found that men and women in their 90s today are mentally sharper than those who reached the same age ten years earlier			1
they also find the physical challenges of day - to - day - life easier			0
the research , published in the @entity18 , contradicts the perception that a longer old age will inevitably bring with it more ill health			1
the @entity23 researchers said : ‘ if this development continues , the future functional problems and care needs of very elderly people might be less than are anticipated			1
’ in other words , we may be able to look forward to a long and healthy old age			0
professor @entity31 , of the @entity32 , analysed data on two large groups of @entity23			1
one set was born in 1905 , and the other in 1915			1
when they reached their mid- 90s they were put through a battery of mental and physical tests , designed to assess factors including memory , grip strength and how easy they found it to walk outside			0
those born in 1915 were two years older when they were tested – yet did better			2
not only were they mentally sharper , but they also found day - to - day life easier			1
and a memory test used to diagnose @entity50 ’s also posed fewer problems for the 90 - somethings born later			2
the researchers said the difference could not simply be attributed to improvements in education			0
@entity57 : a memory test used to diagnose @entity59 s also posed fewer problems for the 90 - somethings born later instead , they believe brain power has been boosted by a variety of factors , including better medical care , improved living conditions , healthier diet and greater intellectual stimulation			2
those born later may also be benefiting from better mobility aids , including ramps and walking frames			0
professor @entity31 said : ‘ the study challenges speculations that the improving longevity is the result of the survival of very frail and disabled elderly people			0
‘ our results suggest that the functioning of people who reach their 90s is improving in @entity23 , and increasing longevity associated with improved living conditions and healthcare may result in not just longer lives , but also that the elderly are functioning better for longer than in earlier generations			1
’ in an accompanying article , experts in geriatric medicine from the @entity94 in @entity95 agreed			0
they said : ‘ the expectation of a continuing sharp rise in dementia prevalence in populations older than 80 or 90 years plays an important part in the alarming predictions about the future global burden of dementia			0
‘ but the evidence for improved cognition at very old age provided by @entity31 and colleagues challenges [ this ]			0
’ but there is one note of caution			0
professor @entity31 said more research is needed to confirm that his findings apply outside @entity23 .			1

research contradicts the notion that a longer old age brings more ill health
@entity23 *scientists* looked at test groups born in 1905 and 1915
those born in 1915 were sharper and also found *everyday* tasks easier
