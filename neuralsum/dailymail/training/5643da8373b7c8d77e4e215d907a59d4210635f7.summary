the boxer hailed a hero after he tracked down the social media troll who called him a ‘ complete disgrace ’ was himself suspended from @entity5 over a spat with leading boxing promoter @entity7			1
@entity8 , a former footballer with @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 , was investigated by @entity5 and had his account blocked on friday , though it was reinstated on monday night			1
remarkably , @entity8 has become a troll himself after the effort he put into finding ‘ @entity15 ’ who attacked him on @entity5 after his defeat by @entity19 in an @entity21 light - welterweight title fight in march 2013			1
@entity8 has had his @entity5 suspended over a spat with leading boxing promotor @entity7 @entity8 , upset at being called a ‘ laughable joke ’ , put up a £ 1,000 reward for information about his troll , whom he located to an address in @entity30 and was about to knock on his door before @entity32 ( @entity33 ) apologised , first on @entity5 and later face to face on @entity36 ’s @entity35 programme			1
and @entity8 was widely praised online , with @entity37 , @entity39 grandee @entity38 and @entity40 all offering messages of support			2
@entity8 , manager of non-league side @entity43 , admits his football career fell apart because of a drinking problem , including taking to the field against @entity47 at @entity48 while still drunk			1
@entity8 had his @entity5 account blocked over a spat with boxing promoter @entity7 ( pictured ) the @entity52 are not too impressed with an ‘ unhelpful ’ @entity53 selecting december 16 — the date of two @entity56 quarter - finals — for their media @entity58 drinks			1
the @entity53 said it was a ‘ scheduling issue during a busy time ’			2
@entity62 , chief executive of @entity63 2018 ’s doomed @entity65 bid , has been conspicuous by his silence since the campaign he led was criticised so strongly by @entity69 ’s widely discredited judgement of @entity70 ‘ s 2018 and 2022 bid corruption report			2
but @entity62 has been concentrating on his day job running sports retailers @entity74 , who are in the process of being sold			0
@entity77 owner @entity76 is one of many interested in buying			0
but his ‘ pile ’ em high ’ @entity80 empire does n’t seem a natural fit with @entity74 , whose corporate partners include the @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			0
@entity62 , chief executive of @entity63 2018 ’s doomed @entity65 bid , speaks to the press earlier this year the ridiculous @entity94 edict that @entity95 had to travel by bus from their @entity98 next door to @entity100 before the @entity63 game rather than walk compares with the rather more recognisable @entity104 team , including @entity105 , making the five - minute journey on foot before their friendly against @entity63			0
@entity109 skips @entity110 ’s big day @entity47 ’s @entity110 may have been making his 100th appearance for @entity63 , with @entity9 legend sir @entity112 presenting him with a golden cap			1
but interestingly , @entity48 executive vice-chairman @entity114 chose to spend his day off at @entity115 watching @entity63 lose to @entity116			1
meanwhile , centurion @entity110 ’s choice of three favourite goals in @entity63 colours seems to change by the day			0
at the start of last week , they were his first against @entity123 , his first tournament goal v @entity125 at @entity126 and a goal v @entity128 in the same tournament			0
but in the @entity100 programme , it was the @entity128 one , the one against @entity132 in a friendly in @entity134 and the one against @entity135 last year			0
@entity137 's executive vice-chairman @entity114 missed @entity110 's landmark cap it begs the question why @entity53 chairman @entity141 went to the considerable cost of setting up an @entity143 to improve the national team when manager @entity145 says after the @entity95 victory : ‘ there ’s enough players to choose from			1
i ’m not stuck for choice			0
’ meanwhile , @entity145 took a dim view that @entity151 , granted an interview after asking to talk about his trip to @entity154 to receive a special award on the 25th anniversary of his five successive league titles with the @entity160 club , never mentioned @entity154 until reminded to do so by @entity145			0
@entity63 manager @entity145 ( left ) and @entity110 face the media ahead of the clash at @entity164 @entity115 regulars , whose @entity167 boot parties have been marginalised by an @entity169 land grab , fear that after the @entity65 the whole of the car park will have been commandeered for commercial activity			2
and they ’re also unimpressed about having to go to @entity173 — not for the horse racing but for the @entity65 park and ride that is being tested for the @entity178 game at @entity115 on saturday .			0

@entity8 has been barred from @entity5 for *posting* *abusive* message to boxing promoter @entity7
@entity8 was once hailed a hero for tracking down the social media troll who called him a ‘ complete disgrace ’
@entity52 upset with ‘ unhelpful ’ @entity53 selecting the date of two @entity56 quarter - finals on december 16 for their media @entity58 drinks
@entity48 executive vice-chairman @entity114 was not present to watch @entity110 make his 100th appearance for his country
