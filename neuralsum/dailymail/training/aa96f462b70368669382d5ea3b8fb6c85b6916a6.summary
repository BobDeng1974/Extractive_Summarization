@entity0 says fans must forget about the ' @entity3 way ' and place their trust in manager @entity6 's philosophy			1
the 20 - time @entity8 champions have struggled for consistency this season after the @entity11 replaced @entity12 in the summer , but still lie third in the @entity14 table			1
@entity15 has been criticised by supporters and pundits alike for his tactical stubbornness , with many suggesting he should revert to a quicker style of play to mirror sir @entity22 's great side			2
@entity3 must get used to their new style of play under @entity6 , according to @entity0 the former @entity3 defender says fans need to let go of the sir @entity22 reign @entity27 celebrates after scoring the second goal against @entity29 in the @entity30 on monday night but former defender and @entity32 pundit @entity0 insists the @entity22 reign should be forgotten if @entity3 want to move forward			1
' the time has come for @entity3 fans – me included – to let go of the sir @entity22 reign and stop judging this new era by former glories , ' @entity0 said in the @entity39			1
' the style of play and the names have changed , but the one person not confused by the team ’s development will be @entity6			1
' i ’ve never been a manager , but i personally believe in attacking football , with a high tempo			0
if @entity3 were committed to protecting that style of play at all costs they should have appointed a manager with those beliefs			1
but there was no way @entity15 was going to come to @entity3 and adopt somebody else ’s philosophy			2
' it ’s a bit like breaking up with a partner of 26 years and wanting the new person to be the same as the old one			0
they – we – are going to have to let go			0
the idea of referencing @entity22 or saying " it ’s not the @entity3 way " at every turn stylistically is not going to take @entity3 anywhere			0
' ( from l to r ) - @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 during training captain @entity74 watches on as ( l to r ) @entity72 , @entity75 and @entity77 work on a drill executive vice-chairman @entity79 and @entity15 have admitted that @entity81 qualification is a must this year after missing out on @entity82 all together last season			0
but @entity3 face a battle for a top - four spot over the next three months , with @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 all closing in			1
@entity0 says a 14 - day period in march with matches against @entity87 and @entity88 with the league as well as @entity87 in an @entity30 quarter - final will be do - or - die for @entity15			1
' definitive opinions remain elusive			0
you can say momentarily : good performance , bad performance ; this player played well , this one played badly			0
' ' but we are moving out of that hazy period , to a 14 - day spell in march when opinions can harden			2
@entity87 in the @entity30 and @entity87 ( home ) and @entity88 ( away ) in the league			0
' to reach an @entity30 semi-final and pick up four league points in those games would put @entity3 within striking range of ending the season on a high			2
those results go wrong , and this could be a baptism of fire for @entity6 in his first season			0
' @entity22 and the @entity3 team celebrate after winning the @entity14 in 2013			2

@entity3 are currently *sitting* third in the @entity14 table
@entity6 has been criticised over ' slow ' style of play
but former defender @entity0 says fans should trust @entity11
no such thing as the ' @entity3 way ' *anymore* , says @entity0
@entity3 face do - or - die period in march with three tough games
