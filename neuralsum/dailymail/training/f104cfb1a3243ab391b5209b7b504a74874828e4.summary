@entity0 and @entity1 are not the kind to blindly toe the party line when it comes to big - money @entity6 signings			1
the pair of club greats cast doubt on the suitability of @entity12 and @entity13 when each arrived in consecutive transfer windows			2
so when both are united in their view that @entity20 is an ideal purchase for @entity22 as he tries to re-energise his team , their words carry value			1
who could argue with players so knowledgeable and forthright in their views ? but watching @entity6 continue their slump into mediocrity during the 1 - 1 draw at @entity47 it was clear some rudimental issues need addressing urgently			1
@entity20 , at only 26 and with a wealth of experience , will bring plenty to @entity6 but is he another cherry on top of a cake that is only half - baked ? if @entity56 is to persist with his 3 - 5 - 2 formation , significant holes need filling at the foundation of his team : centre back and central midfield			1
that latter position has been one crying out for serious investment for years , while the former has increased in importance with @entity56 ’s tactical switch and the departure of @entity68 and @entity69			0
at the @entity71 @entity70 , @entity72 and @entity73 started in defence , with @entity75 arriving after @entity73 ’s injury			0
wanted : @entity77 ( right ) could help to fill a void in the centre of @entity6 's midfield competition : @entity13 's ( centre ) spot in the @entity6 first team could be under threat with the arrival of @entity20 @entity87 and @entity88 began in the middle of the park			1
just how many @entity56 would happily field in a team supposedly chasing the @entity92 is open to question			0
@entity72 and @entity75 are two academy graduates aged 20 and 21 who have shown promise through the youth ranks at @entity6			1
but to thrust responsibility on them during this uncertain period for the club would not be @entity56 ’s preference			0
yes the @entity103 is famed for bringing through young talents in a manner that allies @entity6 ’s history – but not in this band - aid fashion			1
in 1995/96 when sir @entity109 won the double with @entity1 and @entity0 and some other decent kids , his central defenders were @entity112 and @entity113 , aged 30 and 35 respectively			1
the rapid promotion of @entity72 and @entity75 has been through necessity rather than desire and that is unhealthy			0
experience counts in that area of the pitch and without @entity122 there is paucity in leadership and organisation			0
recruits : @entity22 ( centre ) is hoping to strengthen his squad before the transfer window close @entity130 would bring those qualities instantly but looks likely to stay at @entity132 , while @entity133 has gone to @entity134			1
@entity135 should provide a lift but a defender of presence is desperately needed			0
if ever @entity70 and @entity73 were to prove worth the hype and combined outlay of £ 26m it is now			0
in central midfield , dynamism and a defensive screen has been missing since @entity145 left			0
injuries curtailed @entity147 and @entity109 never did promote or purchase a player to take the mantle			2
@entity150 have @entity151 or @entity152 , @entity153 have @entity154 and @entity155 , @entity156 have @entity157 and now @entity158			0
@entity6 must go out and put some oil in the engine room			1
trust : @entity56 is giving youth a chance , but has placed a lot of pressure on the likes of @entity72 ( above ) bad start : @entity6 suffered an opening day @entity170 defeat at the hands of @entity172 @entity173 : @entity56 's side could only manager a 1 - 1 draw against @entity47 on sunday it was interesting @entity56 elected to namedrop @entity77 when asked about @entity20 post @entity47			1
the @entity180 would add that steel sought for so long			0
quite where @entity20 would fit remains to be seen			1
it could be he plays in one of two midfield roles , it could be @entity56 disposes with his new system			0
it appears unlikely @entity20 has been ear - marked for a wing back slot			2
he was man - of - the - match playing as part of a three - man midfield for @entity191 in the @entity92 final and brings pace , drive , and cutting edge ; ingredients absent from @entity6 ’s performances to date			2
but his potential £ 75m move now needs to be part of a spree that ends with at least two arrivals of substance , not just sugar			0
like our dedicated @entity6 facebook page here			2
get him in : @entity130 ( above ) would be an ideal signing for @entity56			2

@entity20 is *n't* the ideal purchase for @entity6
@entity22 should be addressing other *frailties* in the squad
@entity103 boss has placed too much pressure on @entity6 youngsters
@entity218 suffered defeat on opening day of @entity170 *season*
united *legends* @entity0 and @entity1 have backed the signing of @entity20
