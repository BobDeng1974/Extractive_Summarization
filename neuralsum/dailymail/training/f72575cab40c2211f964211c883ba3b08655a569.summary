by @entity0 published : 18:05 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 18:05 est , 23 october 2013 the queen is being urged not to sign a @entity2 drawn up by politicians to oversee regulation of the @entity5 a powerful group of the world ’s leading press freedom organisations has written to the @entity1 urging her not to sign a @entity2 drawn up by politicians to oversee regulation of @entity11 ’s 300 - year - old free press			1
in a strongly - worded letter , they warn that the ‘ toxic ’ charter – written by the three major political parties and the @entity17 lobby group – will have a ‘ chilling ’ effect on journalism in the @entity11			1
but it will also be used by dictators around the world to muzzle the @entity5 in their own countries			2
they also say @entity11 will be unable to exercise a leadership role in arguing for human rights at next month ’s @entity28 heads of government meeting in @entity29 if the charter is approved by the @entity31 and signed by the @entity1 next wednesday			1
the letter – signed by bodies including the @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 – came as a poll suggested that 68 per cent of the public believed politicians would exploit the proposed framework to dampen criticisms and restrict free speech			1
only 13 per cent of those questioned by pollsters @entity43 for the @entity45 agreed the @entity2 would result in a ‘ more vibrant and @entity5 ’ while 62 per cent said the new system should not give politicians the final say on regulation			1
this month , the three main political parties agreed the detail of a charter designed to impose a system of newspaper regulation in the wake of the @entity56			2
an alternative charter proposed by the @entity5 – which would have given an independent regulator strong investigative powers and the right to impose fines of up to £ 1million , up - front corrections , with inaccuracies corrected fully and prominently , and independence from the industry and politicians – was rejected			2
it is thought to be the first time that the @entity1 has been asked to sign a @entity2 forcing a system of regulation on an unwilling industry			1
in their letter , the organisations told her : ‘ no one should be in any doubt that the charter which politicians are forcing your majesty to sign is , despite the camouflage , a set of repressive statutory controls being imposed on the @entity5			1
‘ that should not be the function of a @entity2			2
by laying down rules about how that regulator must work and how the ethical codes that bind the @entity5 should be written , this toxic charter brings @entity89 for the first time ever to the heart of the newsroom			1
‘ it breaches the fundamental principle that politicians must never get involved in editorial content regulation			0
and it lays the foundation for fully fledged statutory controls			0
‘ that will have a chilling impact on journalism throughout the @entity11 – from the biggest national newspapers to the smallest local and regional papers and magazines – weakening democracy			1
’ this month , the three main political parties agreed the detail of a charter designed to impose a system of newspaper regulation in the wake of the @entity56 if the @entity11 moves to control the @entity5 through the law , it will have ‘ a terrifying knock - on effect throughout the @entity28 and much of the developing world where @entity11 has a key leadership role ’ , the letter warned			1
‘ the fact this is being done by @entity2 – an instrument traditionally used to grant rights – will make that infinitely worse because of the respect in which you personally , and the @entity122 institutionally , are held			0
‘ the actions of @entity11 ’s @entity89 will be used as an excuse by those who want to muzzle the @entity5 in their own country – and there are many governments who would love to do so			2
and it is your name , your majesty , that will regrettably be taken in vain			0
‘ if it is good enough for the @entity1 , it is good enough for us			0
’ ‘ already we have seen the chill winds of what is happening in the @entity11 in @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity29			0
’ it warns the charter would be ‘ seized on by enemies of free speech everywhere eager to impose similar controls ’			0
it added : ‘ this issue is of huge importance in the @entity11			0
it is important for @entity11 ’s standing in the world			2
but above all , it is important for the impact on countries not nearly so lucky as the many of us in @entity157 who until now have enjoyed fundamental freedoms			0
’ @entity163 editor - in - chief @entity159 , who has been critical of the rival publishers ’ plan , said the charter is a ‘ medieval piece of nonsense ’			0
speaking in a debate on tuesday organised by the @entity168 , he condemned the cross-party regulation plan .			0
