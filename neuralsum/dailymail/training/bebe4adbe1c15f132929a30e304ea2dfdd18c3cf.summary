by @entity0 an artist has married the man of her dreams four years after painting his lookalike in a prophetic piece of artwork			2
in 2009 , @entity7 , who was single at the time , quickly dashed off an oil painting of her holding hands with a handsome , dark bearded man			1
not thinking anything more of the creation , the 31 - year - old left the painting to gather dust in the corner of her living room			2
artist @entity7 painted a picture of her perfect husband ... only to later meet an identical real - life version because the oil painting was so uncannily similar to @entity23 , she hid the canvas under her bed in fear he thought she may have been stalking him , but he fell in love with it in her search for love , @entity7 joined an online dating website , and began messaging @entity33 , 30			1
two months later the pair met - and @entity7 was shocked to find @entity23 was the spitting image of the man in her painting			1
in fear of putting off her new lover , @entity7 hid the uncanny painting under her bed , only revealing it once she had been on more dates with @entity23			2
thankfully , he was not put off by the painting and they continued their relationship for a further 18 months until he proposed while they were holidaying in the south of @entity48			2
three years after they first met , @entity7 and @entity23 married , and the painting now has pride of place in the living room of the couple 's home in @entity56 near @entity57 in @entity58			1
@entity7 , a regulation manager for medical equipment , said : ' i had moved back to the @entity62 after spending time working in @entity63 and the house needed brightening up			0
after dating for six weeks @entity7 thought @entity23 's face looked familiar and then remembered her painting and realised he was the spitting image of the man she painted ' i started painting some pictures to decorate the walls and i had a couple of ideas i wanted to incorporate			1
' i wanted to create an image of a couple at nighttime but i did n't really have any set ideas , i just did what felt natural			0
' i painted kisses coming off the trees so it looked romantic but the facial features on the people i actually added in last , i did n't intend for it to look like me with anyone			0
' i did n't hang it up , i just left it in a pile in the corner of my lounge for weeks and forgot about it but after a night out with @entity91 realised he looked just like the man			0
' he was due to come over to my house and i thought that if he saw the picture he would think i was a stalker and a bit weird , so i hid it under my bed			0
' about a week later i mustered up the courage to show him and although he looked a bit confused , he saw the funny side when i explained what had happened			0
the happy couple , who met online , now hang the painting on their wall and dub him ' the man in the painting ' ' now we have hung the picture up on the wall in the lounge and all our friends called @entity23 " the man in the painting "			1
' i never would have thought i 'd have predicted my husband and i do n't normally believe in that sort of thing , but i suppose it must be fate			0
