by @entity0 @entity1 , who has been jailed for 20 months for perverting the course of justice over the death of her son , seven week - old @entity5 a young mother who was accused of killing her baby has escaped the blame for his violent death after she concocted a ' pack of lies ' with her boyfriend and landlord to cover it up			1
@entity1 , 24 , of @entity16 , @entity17 , was charged after seven week - old son @entity5 died in hospital having been admitted with multiple injuries consistent with being squeezed beaten and shaken			1
but although she , her boyfriend @entity22 , 35 , and landlord @entity23 , 26 , all lied about the circumstances leading up to the youngster ’s death , all escaped culpability for the tragedy after a legal technicality meant it was impossible to prove who caused the baby ’s injuries			1
initially , the trio had all signed a statement falsely claiming @entity5 was injured accidentally when @entity1 slipped and dropped him on a flight of stairs before falling on top of him			1
but @entity41 showed @entity1 out shopping on the day of her son ’s death - leaving him at home with her landlord who subsequently said the baby had injured himself accidentally in his cradle			1
it was then claimed @entity1 had waited ten hours before taking her fatally injured son to hospital while she and @entity23 researched head injury symptoms on @entity54 as @entity22 looked on			1
medical evidence later showed the fatal injury was inflicted on @entity5 closer to the time of his admission to hospital			1
at @entity60 , @entity1 , @entity22 and @entity23 had all faced trial accused of allowing or causing the death of a baby but a judge halted the case after ruling it could not be proved who caused the injuries to @entity5 - or when they were caused			1
@entity1 's boyfriend @entity22 and landlord @entity23 were also sentenced to 20 months he ordered jurors to return not guilty verdicts on all three and also ordered them to acquit @entity23 on a separate charge of manslaughter			1
all were instead jailed for 20 months each for perverting the course of justice by providing the false statement			1
the verdicts meant the truth behind little @entity5 ’ death may now remain a mystery			2
@entity1 had originally been charged with murder			0
earlier the jury was told @entity1 had moved to the @entity82 from her native @entity83 in 2010 but had no contact with @entity5 ’s father @entity85 , 36 , who was initially unaware the child was his			2
@entity23 , 26 , lived with @entity1 and @entity5 and often acted as carer for her son , as did @entity22 , a frequent visitor to the address			1
tragedy struck just a week after @entity5 was examined by a health visitor on january 17 and was found to be a healthy , growing baby with no medical problems			2
loss : floral tributes and soft toys left at the home in @entity16 after @entity5 ' death on january 25 he was admitted to @entity98 with multiple bruises all over his body , severe retinal bleeding in both eyes and was noted to be pale , unresponsive and having a seizure			0
he was transferred to @entity104 but was pronounced dead two days later			0
tests showed he had 22 bruises four broken ribs and bleeding on the brain			0
initially when @entity1 took @entity5 to hospital she told nurses she had been alone in the house with @entity5 all day and was carrying him up the stairs when she slipped on a rug and dropped him			2
she claimed she was unable to stop herself falling on top of the baby and causing him severe injuries			0
when @entity1 took @entity5 to hospital she told nurses she had been alone in the house with @entity5 all day and was carrying him up the stairs when she slipped on a rug and dropped him but staff at the hospital suspected serious non-accidental injury and contacted police			1
@entity125 and @entity23 agreed to sign statements verifying her account of what happened			0
but officers investigated further and @entity41 captured her visiting @entity16 town centre on her own january 25 leaving @entity5 at home			0
@entity22 was captured on cameras boarding a bus and arriving at the house at 2pm - seven hours earlier than he originally stated			0
all three later admitted their initial account was false and accepted @entity1 was not alone with @entity5 and did not fall while carrying him			1
@entity23 later told police he had been in the house between 9am and 1pm but had been unaware he was supposed to be caring for @entity5 until he heard him crying			2
he then brought the baby downstairs and placed him in a plastic rocking cradle and rocked him to sleep			0
@entity1 then returned to find her son had a cut and bruise to his lip and confronted @entity23 who claimed he too fell asleep himself and the boy must have accidentally banged his mouth on the frame of his rocking cradle			1
@entity22 said the group sat on a sofa and using @entity54 to research and the read out ‘ brain concussion of a child symptoms ’ and ‘ baby staring in one place			0
’ during the trial prosecutor @entity158 said the jury was entitled to ask whey they had told ' a pack of lies ' and added : ' why did the three defendants agree to lie about what happened to @entity5 ? ' was it because they feared the @entity167 coming in asking questions or was there some other motive for shielding the truth from the hospital staff and police ? ' we know at some stage someone within that household unlawfully caused injury to @entity5 either by striking him or squeezing him , causing four fractures to the ribs on the left side of his body			2
' he said @entity5 ’s body was examined by a number of medical experts including a consultant paediatrician who concluded the number of bruises - 25 different sites - were ' suggestive of inflicted injuries and are not consistent with accidental injuries to a non-mobile baby '			0
he added : ' in particular she noted that the injuries to both ears were unusual and would suggest either an impact with a hard surface or that he had been slapped across the face			0
' the post-mortem examination also revealed that @entity5 had four fractured ribs said to have been caused in the days before he suffered the fatal head injury			2
the post-mortem examination also revealed that @entity5 had four fractured ribs and medical experts said he had 25 bruises mr @entity205 said the expert view was that the most probable cause was non-accidental and the amount of force required would be ' considerable , even on a baby of this age '			0
after the case @entity212 for @entity213 said : ' on 26th january 2014 , a seven week - old baby boy was admitted to @entity98 with head injuries , where he tragically died the next evening			0
' following an investigation by @entity219 a senior crown prosecutor conducted a thorough review of the evidence			0
' a decision was made that the baby ’s mother @entity1 and her partner @entity22 should be prosecuted for causing or allowing the death of a child , and their landlord @entity23 prosecuted for manslaughter			1
' the case proceeded to trial at @entity60 and commenced on 9th july 2014			0
' as the trial progressed it became apparent that the medical evidence was now suggesting that the fatal injury was inflicted much later in the day than previously thought and closer to the time of the baby ’s admission to hospital			2
' as a result we could no longer prove to the very high criminal standard who was responsible for inflicting that injury , nor that ms @entity1 and mr @entity22 by either act or omission had caused or allowed the death to occur			1
' senior investigating officer @entity247 from the @entity248 said : ' @entity1 , @entity23 and @entity22 all colluded together to hide the truth of what really happened to baby @entity5 that night			1
he had been subjected to abusive head trauma caused by violent shaking and suffered a number of other injuries including fractured ribs			0
' this has been a very sad and difficult investigation for all those involved			0
' in a statement , @entity5 ’ family said : ' as a family we are all truly devastated and deeply shocked by the tragedy we have all suffered and the loss of our little baby boy			2

@entity1 gave false statement over death of baby son @entity5
boyfriend @entity22 and @entity23 also lied
it could not be proved who caused fatal injury , so none were *convicted*
they were jailed for 20 months each for perverting the course of justice
