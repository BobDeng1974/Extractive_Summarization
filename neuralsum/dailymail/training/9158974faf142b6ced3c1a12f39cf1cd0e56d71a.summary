by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has claimed he has inherited a ' broken team ' at @entity4			1
the @entity6 coach is three weeks away from the start of the @entity9 season and is hurriedly trying to impose his beliefs and philosophies on a squad that finished seventh under @entity13 last may			1
asked if he was taking over at @entity15 at a good time , @entity14 said : ' no. i do n't agree			1
i had to follow @entity18 at @entity19 the year after he won three titles and there was n't a problem			2
' it is not in balance			2
it 's more difficult to succeed in a difficult situation than in a fantastic situation			1
' @entity14 also insisted he will not be forced into panic buys as he settles down in his new job			1
the @entity6 has n't yet looked at his squad fully to assess his assets , but will not buy for the sake of it			1
@entity4 have not opened talks with @entity53 over @entity54 but remain keen on @entity34 defender @entity31 and @entity56 midfielder @entity55			1
@entity57 : @entity4 players train on their pre-season tour of the @entity60 established faces : @entity62 and @entity23 train ahead of their match against @entity65 authoritarian : the @entity6 coach is famed for running a tight ship and not putting up with any troublemakers answer : @entity69 ( right ) has said he wants to prove that he can be part of @entity4 's new defensive system @entity72 : @entity14 ( centre ) is still keen on bringing @entity56 's @entity55 ( centre left ) to @entity4 central figur : @entity14 will utilise @entity23 as a no 9 or 10 as he sets out his formation for this season @entity14 has opted for a wing - back system against @entity78 and @entity56 , which is more suited to the players at his disposal in the @entity60			1
and he told @entity81 : ‘ i do n’t buy players for the sake of it			2
i buy players to improve my selection			2
‘ first , i must see what i need in all the positions from the system we shall play and , at this moment , i do n’t know for sure			0
‘ that ’s why i chose this system , i can play them all			0
but ( @entity94 ) @entity93 can also play in the @entity96 ’s position , so can ( @entity98 ) @entity97			0
‘ @entity23 can play at @entity99 and no 9 and he tells me he can also play at @entity101 and no 7 , but i prefer him at 9 or 10			0
‘ when you look at the quality of your players – you see @entity23 , @entity28 , @entity93 , @entity106 , @entity97 , ( @entity108 ) @entity107 , ( @entity110 ) @entity109 a lot of players can play this system			0
do it : both @entity114 and @entity115 have something to prove this season after a difficult last season transfers : @entity14 is keen on @entity55 and @entity31 but progress has been slow big challenge : @entity4 boss @entity14 accepts it will be a tough task to succeed at @entity15 @entity123 and altitude affected us - @entity14 new system : @entity14 is adamant his current players can adapt to the new 3 - 5 - 2 formation ‘ so with this system , two strikers can play , the @entity99 can play , two midfielders can play , so the specialists become the wingbacks			1
’ @entity14 insists he is not under pressure having taken over at @entity15 , because he has experience from previous jobs			1
he added : ‘ it was not an instant “ yes ” because i had other offers also			0
so i had to think about it			0
‘ but i chose “ yes ” because of the big challenge			0
i have been at @entity141 – the biggest club in the @entity6 – i went to @entity19 – the biggest club in @entity144 – and then i go to @entity145 , also the number one in @entity147			2
‘ so when @entity4 came i thought i had to say “ yes ”			2
’ as for trying to emulate sir @entity148 , he says : ‘ i highly respect sir @entity148 because there is not another trainer or manager who has won so many titles			0
‘ i have won a lot of titles but he has won so many with one club and that is fantastic			0
so when you compare sir @entity148 with me i am very proud			0

@entity4 finished seventh in @entity9 last season under @entity13
the @entity6 believes it 's a difficult time to take over at @entity4
@entity14 adamant he will not panic buy in the transfer *market*
