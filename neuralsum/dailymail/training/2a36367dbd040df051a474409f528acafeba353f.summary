some 37 influential conservative mps are publishing a report today calling on the chancellor to permanently grant small firms exemption from business rates			1
and last night @entity10 sources said mr @entity8 will heed their advice in his @entity20 on thursday			1
the @entity4 ’ report says firms are still suffering from excessive regulation			1
last night , a @entity10 source said : ‘ i understand there will be some action on this			1
’ the demand comes as leading @entity29 also called for income tax cuts and @entity32 mayor @entity31 pressed the case for a one - off vat cut on a new bridge in the capital			2
the group of mps , led by backbencher @entity39 , also call for councils to offer rate cuts to businesses who occupy empty properties			1
and the @entity4 said the threshold of taxable income at which firms have to register for vat should rise from £ 79,000 to £ 100,000			1
small companies are completely exempt from business rates until march 31 , 2014 , on properties with a rateable value of £ 6,000 or less and get some relief on those whose rateable value is under £ 12,000			2
treasury sources said the chancellor will have to ‘ make a decision ’ on what to do about business rate relief as it is due to expire next year			1
insiders say it is likely he will extend it until the @entity65			2
but the @entity4 say it should be made permanent			2
all shops and offices pay business rates , a tax for local services			2
the amount they pay is based on the rateable value of the property , roughly the amount those premises could have been let for at the last valuation in april 2008			0
small firms currently get a 100 per cent rebate on their business rates if their rateable value is under £ 6,000			1
this then tapers off until relief hits zero at properties with a rateable value of £ 12,000			0
@entity4 are calling for the rateable value threshold to go up to £ 14,000			0
mp @entity39 is leading the group , which also call for councils to offer rate cuts to businesses who occupy empty properties those who have signed the paper include chairman of the treasury select committee @entity98 and @entity100 ’s envoy to the @entity102 community @entity103			0
mr @entity39 said : ‘ in preparing his @entity20 , @entity8 should consider how tough life is for many businesses			0
the combination of business rates and red tape is stifling people ’s ability to drive the economy forward			0
’ the @entity113 report comes amid calls for cuts to personal taxation			0
former defence secretary @entity117 said yesterday mr @entity8 should return to his pre-crash policy of ‘ sharing the proceeds of growth ’ – between measures to control the deficit and easing the cost of living for cash - strapped families			0
mr @entity8 will also announce £ 30million of public money for the construction of a ‘ garden bridge ’ across the @entity128			0
sources close to mr @entity31 say he is pressing mr @entity130 to give it a vat exemption .			0
