a mother and father are staging an early @entity2 for their two - year - old daughter who has such aggressive cancer she may not make it to december			1
@entity7 was diagnosed with @entity8 and adrenocortical carcinoma last spring			1
the genetic syndrome , which affects fewer than 500 people in the world , has created the rare cancer and given her more than 30 tumors on her lungs , one on her adrenal gland , another in her belly and one on her spine			1
tragic : @entity7 , aged two , has been given one month to live after contracting adrenal gland cancer last wish : her parents @entity24 and @entity27 hope to make her last @entity2 the most special diagnosed : this is @entity29 in the early stage of her cancer last spring went she grew three dress sizes in 10 days despite undergoing intense chemotherapy twice and multiple surgeries , doctors at the hospital in @entity37 , @entity38 , have told her parents , childhood sweethearts @entity24 and @entity27 , that she has between one and three months left			1
' @entity7 is our precious little angel , she is so sweet and deserves a chance to be with us a little longer , ' her mother said			2
but @entity24 added that it is unlikely she will live out the full three months : ' we want her last @entity2 to be the best and we also want for her funeral service to be very special			1
' and yesterday , they were delivered the painful news that she could have as little as a day left			1
@entity24 was tearful as he told @entity52 : ' she is in a world of pain that i could n't even imagine			1
' it is just getting harder and harder and harder			0
' the couple noticed something was wrong when @entity29 ballooned from aged two clothes to aged five clothes in just 10 days			1
she is now continuing to swell up and is becoming increasingly lethargic			0
devastated : her mother @entity27 ( pictured with @entity29 ) said she can not contemplate losing her daughter fun : @entity29 loves dressing up but she is finding it harder to breathe and play as her cancer gets worse in a recent local tv interview , @entity24 broke down in tears as he could hear the microphone picking up @entity29 struggling to breathe			1
' it was just too much			0
she finds it so difficult			0
sometimes now she just sleeps for hours at a time			0
' her mother updated family and friends on their @entity77 page : ' she is so swollen now and her tummy is as hard as a rock			2
but the saddest part is she is struggling to breathe now			2
' i am scared to fall asleep every night because i 'm afraid she will stop breathing in the middle of the night			0
' struggling to pay for groceries on top of the extortionate medical bills , @entity24 and @entity27 are now trying to raise money for a final attempt at treatment to cure her or ease the pain			1
@entity8 ( @entity8 ) is a disorder that affects a handful of people worldwide			0
it stems from mutations of either the @entity96 gene or @entity98 gene , which normally act as tumor suppressors by controlling the growth and division of cells			0
when mutated , it allows cells to multiply , grow and divide in and out - of - control nature , making sufferers more susceptible to cancer , especially leukaemia , brain and breast cancer			2
in many cases , one of the sufferer 's relatives will have had a cancer that displays similar characteristics			2
@entity29 's @entity8 prompted adrenocortical carcinoma , a rare cancer that forms in the outer layer of tissue of the adrenal gland			1
the gland is a small organ on top of each kidney that makes steroid hormones , adrenaline , and noradrenaline to control heart rate , blood pressure and other body functions			2
the disease , which affects up to just two million people a year , has a five - year survival rate of 20 - 35 per cent			0
symptoms include hair growth , weight gain , a lump in the stomach or back of the head , muscle weakness and high blood pressure			0
but with the understanding that it is unlikely to work , the funds will also go towards staging an early @entity2 for @entity29 as well as a funeral			1
' if nothing else this medicine could possibly make her more comfortable while she is here , ' said @entity27			2
' we also would like to celebrate @entity2 with @entity7 and are probably going to have to do it early now			1
