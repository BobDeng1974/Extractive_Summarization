like many social media evangelists , @entity1 founder @entity0 uses a variety of digital platforms to document his life but one of his latest posts might get him into trouble			0
last thursday morning as @entity0 ’s commercial flight was taking off from @entity10 he tweeted a link to a short clip of his flight leaving the ground			1
to film such a video @entity0 would have had to use his cellphone , thereby disobeying @entity18 instructions which prohibit the use of electronic devices during take - off and landings			1
like many social media evangelists , @entity1 founder @entity0 uses a variety of digital platforms to document his life @entity0 , now ceo of mobile payments company @entity27 , has not replied to requests for comment about his actions , but according to @entity33 passengers might not need to comply with that particular request for much longer			0
the @entity18 claims that using electrical devices during take - off poses a safety issue and that radio signals emitted from electronic devices can interfere with an aircraft 's communications			1
however this does n’t prevent as many as 69 percent of adult passengers reportedly using their portable devices during flights , according to a recent study by the @entity47 and the @entity48			2
almost one - third of passengers say they have accidentally left their device on , found the same survey			0
last thursday morning as @entity0 's commercial flight was taking off from @entity10 he tweeted a link to a short video clip of his flight leaving the ground as a result of such large numbers of passengers failing to comply with the request to switch electrical devices off , the @entity18 is currently looking into what kind of devices it might be ok for passengers to use on board in those situations			1
a draft of the committee 's report recommends the @entity18 should relax its ban on e-readers and mp3 players , but not cell phones , reports the @entity74			2
' as the consumer electronics industry has exploded , ' the report says , the @entity18 's traditional stance of giving individual airlines leeway to evaluate the safety of specific devices before allowing them to remain on at low altitude ' has become untenable			0
' the @entity18 likely wo n't make a formal decision on the matter until after it receives the final version of the advisory panel 's study , now delayed til end of september .			0

@entity0 tweeted a link to a @entity92 clip of his flight taking off
using his cellphone was in *contravention* of @entity18 instructions
*research* has found nearly *70* percent of adult passengers do n't switch off electronic devices during take - off and landing
the @entity18 is expected to *announce* in september that some devices - such as mp3 players and e-readers - will become *exempt*
