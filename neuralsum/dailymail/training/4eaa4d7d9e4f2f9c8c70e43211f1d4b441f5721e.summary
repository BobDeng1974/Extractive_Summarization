published : 14:05 est , 29 october 2013 updated : 16:21 est , 29 october 2013 the evolution of high - quality vision in our distant ancestors could have been driven by a fear of snakes , claim scientists			2
a new study has supported an older theory that the threat of snakes led to the evolution of primates ' forward - facing eyes and enlarged visual centres deep in their brains - and could even apply to humans			1
the sinuous movement of a snake triggers a primal reaction of panic , even before primates actually realise they have seen the reptile			0
a new study has supported an older theory that the threat of snakes led to the evolution of primates ' forward - facing eyes and enlarged visual centres deep in their brain the results of a study of the monkey brain suggests primates are uniquely adapted to identity the features of a snake threat and react in a split second			1
an encounter with a snake very often resulted in death for pre-primates , when reptiles slithered through the forests of @entity46 approximately 100 million years ago to squeeze small ancestors of modern primates to death			0
in 2006 , @entity50 , a behavioral ecologist the @entity52 , argued that the threat of the reptiles led to the evolution of primates ' front - facing eyes and a special area of the brain designed to pick out specific features in the world - including the sinuous movement of a snake , @entity61 reported			1
she showed that primates that have not come across poisonous snakes , such as @entity66 in @entity67 , have less acute vision than other primates that have learned to live with snakes , but there was no neurobiological evidence to support her research			2
new research describes how images of snakes affect a cluster of neurons in an ancient part of the brain called the thalamus			1
the cluster of neutrons , called the pulvinar are thought to direct the primates attention using their eyes to rapidly recognise a threat			0
a scan of a monkey 's brain is pictured however , new research by the @entity93 in @entity94 and the @entity95 in @entity96 , published in the @entity97 , describes how images of snakes affect a cluster of neurons in an ancient part of the brain called the thalamus			1
the cluster of neutrons , called the pulvinar are thought to direct the primates attention using their eyes to rapidly recognise a threat			0
the research found that primates have larger pulvinars than other animals and part of the cluster is unique to them			2
in order to come to this conclusion , the scientists inserted electrodes into the brains of two captive macaque monkeys that had never had to contend with snakes and measured the electrical spikes from neurons in two regions of the pulvinar			0
they did this while the monkeys looked at four types images - one type of which was of snakes that were coiled and stretched out			0
the scientists inserted electrodes into the brains of two captive macaque monkeys 9similar to the ones pictured ) that had never had to contend with snakes and measured the electrical spikes from neurons in two regions of the pulvinar while the creatures looked at images including snakes the team discovered that the snake pictures had a rapid and strong effect on the pulvinar neurons			1
the neurons were more active than when the monkey was shown images of faces and shapes and activated 25 milliseconds faster than the shape - detecting neurons			0
professor @entity50 said the new study is the ' first neuroscientific support ' for her theory and believes that the pulvinar neutrons make primates the most effective of any mammals at recognising snakes			2
@entity162 , a cognitive psychologist at the @entity163 , @entity164 ¨ res , in @entity166 , warned that the theory might not transfer to humans even if the snake - detecting neurons are a part of our brains , because other processes such as learning and memory probably influence our behaviour just as much as deep instinct			1
she said : ' itâ € ™ s a very important part of the picture , but it is only a part			0

research by the @entity93 in @entity94 and the @entity95 in @entity96 found snake images affect neurons in an ancient part of the brain
the results suggest primates are uniquely adapted to identity the features of a snake threat and react in a split second
the study supports an older theory that snakes led to the evolution of primates ' forward - facing eyes and enlarged visual centres in their brains
