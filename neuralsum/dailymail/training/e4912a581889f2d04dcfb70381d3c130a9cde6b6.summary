by @entity0 published : 13:56 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 14:02 est , 19 july 2013 @entity1 , 34 , was found with his headphones hooked up to his mobile phone after the collision a cyclist was killed on a level crossing while seemingly oblivious to the approaching train because he was listening to music on his earphones			1
@entity1 , a father - of - three , failed to hear the passenger train ’s horn as it thundered towards him , or the shouts of horrified bystanders who tried to stop the cyclist from moving on to the crossing			1
an inquest heard mr @entity1 , 34 , ‘ did not flinch ’ despite the desperate attempts of two walkers to alert him to the oncoming danger			1
giving evidence at @entity22 @entity21 said he and his friend @entity23 heard the train twice sound its horn moments after seeing the cyclist ride on to the tracks - but he did n’t seem to hear them or the approaching train			1
mr @entity1 had been cycling home from his job as a precision engineer when he was hit by the train on the @entity33 crossing near @entity34 , @entity35			1
his earphones were hooked up to his mobile phone but were found to be dangling loose of his ears following the collision , meaning the coroner could not be certain he had been listening to them at the point of impact			1
but she recorded a verdict of accidental death after concluding mr @entity1 may have been distracted by listening to music in the build - up to the fatal incident			1
@entity52 , the assistant deputy coroner for @entity35 , said : ‘ i conclude for reasons we will never know with absolute certainty , mr @entity1 rode on to the track with no regard for his safety			2
‘ i find in balance that mr @entity1 did n’t hear the shouts or the horn			1
despite the sounding of the horn , he did n’t react , flinch , or divert from the path , let along look at the direction of the train			1
‘ sadly i ’m driven to the view that the single most important aspect in this case was the behaviour of mr @entity1 himself			2
’ at the time of the tragedy in may last year , @entity69 said mr @entity1 was thought to have been listening to music			2
witnesses had reported seeing the cyclist , wearing headphones under his hood , approached the lowered barriers and manoeuvre his bike around them			0
the divorced father - of - three was cycling home from work when he was killed at the crossing near @entity34			1
a ' stop , look , listen ' sign was in place			0
plans to install a red and green warning light two months before mr @entity1 's death had been delayed the footpath crossing had ‘ wicket gates ’ and a ‘ @entity92 ’ sign			1
the train which struck mr @entity1 had been travelling from @entity94 to @entity95			1
the three - day inquest at @entity94 heard a risk assessment of the crossing in 2007 found that installing red and green warning lights at the location could improve safety			2
@entity69 had also drawn up plans to put a bridge over the train line at the crossing two months before mr @entity1 ’s death			2
but the scale of the project meant it had n’t been implemented			0
rail bosses also said a number of changes had been made to the crossing since mr @entity1 ’s death , including a redesigned approach to the crossing , vegetation management , and a temporary reduction in speed			2
a @entity69 spokesman said : ‘ a very early feasibility study was completed at this site , as with many others in the @entity121 , to establish if it is physically possible to construct a bridge at this site			0
' mr @entity1 ’s sister , @entity124 , 40 , said her brother , who was divorced , was not known to regularly wear earphones while cycling , although he regularly commuted by bicycle to ‘ keep up his fitness ’			0
following the inquest at @entity22 , mr @entity1 's sister @entity124 said ' human beings get distracted and make poor decisions ' mrs @entity124 , also of @entity134 , ‘ we have always known that @entity136 was not under the influence of any substances , was not breaking the law in any way , and only acted within human nature			2
‘ @entity1 was n’t acting the fool , he was just cycling his way home after a hard day at work			0
‘ human beings get distracted , make poor decisions and experience inattention blindness			0
human beings in the 21st century wear earphones			0
‘ we hold the belief that @entity69 has a responsibility for user safety			0
all that was there was a basic black and white warning sign			0
‘ we feel it should have been in conspicuous bright colours that caught the eye			0
‘ the verdict of accidental death was expected but the family are disappointed that following the acceptance of @entity69 of a need for a bridge prior to the accident , that it failed to implement any interim safety measures such as a reduction in speed			0
‘ since @entity169 only needed a fraction of a second more to get off the crossing , we believe that this would have saved his life			0

@entity1 ' did not flinch ' when the train 's horn sounded twice
