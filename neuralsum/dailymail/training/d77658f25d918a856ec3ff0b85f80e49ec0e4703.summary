it was the proudest moment of @entity2 's career and he understandably did n't want to say a word out of turn			2
@entity5 had just named him captain for @entity8 's tour match against @entity9 and the midfielder wanted to say something that would resonate with the new boss sat beside him			1
' i watched the @entity14 in the @entity15 and i think i 'm going to be his type of player , ' @entity2 asserted , sending out a clear signal of his intent to hold down a starting place this season			1
it was a smart remark but the reaction was merciless			0
' @entity2 should be a comedian , ' retorted one wag			0
others suggested he move to @entity51 , or @entity52			0
most were variations on ' lol ' or ' lmao '			0
some we ca n't repeat			0
it showed once again how @entity2 's stock has plummeted since sir @entity58 identified him as a homegrown replacement for @entity60 three years ago			0
when @entity8 visited the @entity61 back in 2011 , @entity2 ran the midfield against @entity64 champions @entity63 and was poised to make a big breakthrough			1
three years on , it seems like he 's having to start from square one again			0
scorn : this tweet on @entity8 's official feed was met with a torrent of negative responses low point : @entity2 's performances last season epitomised the failings of the @entity38 era in the opinion of many @entity8 fans @entity2 , 24 , epitomised the frustrations of the @entity38 era at @entity81			1
overpowered , technically deficient and apparently unable to create anything , he was an easy scapegoat as @entity8 slumped to seventh place in the @entity85			2
he was abysmal when @entity8 crashed 2 - 0 in @entity86 against @entity87 in the @entity88 last - 16 and embarrassingly hooked at half - time during the 3 - 0 home loss to champions - elect @entity91			1
he responded to @entity64 defeat to @entity94 by going out on the town and did n't appear again under the doomed @entity38 regime			0
indeed , @entity2 was so consistently sub-par he played himself out of contention for the @entity99 @entity15 squad			2
accused of a string of ' inept ' displays and ' without possessing any genuine qualities whatsoever ' , he was even targeted by an online petition calling on @entity104 to ban him			0
next big thing : @entity2 celebrates with @entity106 as @entity8 beat @entity63 on their pre-season tour of the @entity61 back in 2011 national duty : @entity2 is also highly - regarded by @entity99 manager @entity104 , who once likened him to @entity110 's @entity109 but van @entity5 is willing to wipe the slate clean and give @entity2 , like every other member of the @entity8 squad , a fair chance to stake his claim			1
he played 45 minutes of the 7 - 0 win over the @entity118 and was given 70 minutes in the 3 - 2 victory over @entity9			1
even more encouragingly , the fact @entity5 was willing to toss him the captain 's armband against the @entity124 side suggests @entity2 , who has been at @entity8 since the age of 11 , will be given every opportunity to impress			1
@entity128 's type of player is dogged , tactically astute and willing to sacrifice everything for the team 's cause			1
there are plenty of @entity8 fans who doubt @entity2 has any of these attributes , but it 's worth remembering that the criticism has come in the last 12 months			1
honour : @entity2 expressed his pride at captaining @entity8 , whom he joined at the age of 11 , for the first time against @entity9 getting stuck in : @entity2 needs to show all of his battling qualities to win back his place in the @entity8 side this season while graduating from the @entity81 academy , his spells on loan were a fantastic success			1
he helped @entity151 win promotion back to the @entity153 in 2009 , was @entity155 's @entity154 the following season , and very good for @entity156 in the top flight in 2010 - 2011			2
the following campaign saw him impress for @entity8 and capped for @entity99 before suffering an injury set - back that checked his progress			2
still , @entity104 believed he could do the same job for @entity99 that @entity109 does for @entity110			0
it has n't turned out that way yet			0
his poor performances last season have now left @entity2 having to prove himself all over again , not only to a new manager but the @entity8 faithful as well			1
he should try and recall some of these noteworthy moments in his early career as he strives to re-establish his reputation			0
the competition : @entity172 , signed by @entity8 this summer , has already impressed on the pre-season tour of the @entity61 setback : midfielder @entity175 has been ruled out for the next three months with an ankle injury he will face stiff competition for a place in the @entity8 midfield with @entity172 arriving from @entity180 and already looking impressive			1
with @entity175 ruled out for three months with an ankle injury , further reinforcements could follow and it is well known that @entity5 retains an interest in @entity9 's @entity186 international @entity185			2
@entity2 will feel he 's turned over a new leaf but without consistent performances from the off it 'll be a false dawn			0
he knows @entity5 - and the fans - will not tolerate anything less .			0

@entity2 captained @entity8 in their 3 - 2 win over @entity9 in @entity195
@entity197 said before the match he sees himself as a player @entity5 will want in his team
24 - year - old was *widely* criticised for his poor performances last season
@entity128 has *pledged* to give every member of the squad a chance to impress
@entity2 faces stiff competition for midfield place at @entity81
