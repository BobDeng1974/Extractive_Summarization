after @entity1 , @entity2 and the abuse of young , vulnerable women in @entity5 , you ’d be forgiven for thinking there has been a sea change			2
that any man who transgresses against a woman will be stopped ; that women will finally be believed ; that we can trust the judicial system			0
my experience over the past two very difficult and distressing years proves the opposite is true			0
when i bought my house in october 2012 in the breathtakingly beautiful @entity16 , with a cottage on site for my assistant / animal behaviourist , @entity20 , who has worked for me for seven years , i thought we would be able to live in peace			1
the caretaker had warned me as he left the property about the farmer next door , saying he and the farmer had been at it ‘ hammer and tongs ’ for years			1
@entity30 , pictured , has suffered an ordeal at the hands of a neighbour near the home she bought in 2012 @entity30 moved to the stone farmhouse in @entity36 , in the picturesque north @entity16 dales @entity30 , pictured , said since moving to her house , she and her neighbour @entity20 have been stalked by a farmer the farmer , @entity41 , who lives alone , is 43 , and deaf and partially dumb			1
being profoundly deaf myself , i immediately empathised			0
as two single women in a remote area , @entity20 and i keep our counsel			1
we do n’t really socialise , as neither of us have time			0
as single women , even going to the pub can be misconstrued			0
but living just 500 yards from @entity41 ’s farm , we tried to be polite good , helpful neighbours , and at first we all got on ok			1
i rented one of his fields for my horses , at a cost of £ 3,000 a year			2
@entity20 quickly learned sign language and would help @entity41 out by phoning people on his behalf			1
when @entity41 ’s dog was run over , @entity20 took it to the vet , and phoned them daily for updates			1
but it being a small rural area , where locals know everything about each other , we soon learned that @entity41 had been cautioned not long before we moved in for stalking his ex-girlfriend , who had moved out of the area to avoid him , so we made sure to lock our doors			1
we had moved unwittingly into an already volatile situation			0
and then , in the summer of 2013 , the abuse of @entity20 started			1
it was harmless , if creepy , at first			0
@entity41 began to spy on her ; we would catch him looking out of his window – we are the only two properties on our dead - end lane – just standing , staring			1
@entity30 believes that this dead rabbit , which @entity20 found on her doorstep was part of the intimidation campaign @entity30 's house , left , is only a few hundred yards away from farmer @entity41 , who lives down the lane , right and then the stalking took on a sexual nature			1
he started to bombard @entity20 with bizarrely worded , obscene text messages such as ‘ i want you , together love cuddle ’ , ‘ ready hard play sex ’ and ‘ want love sex , b * * * job ’			1
the sexual stuff was never aimed at me ; he often made the sign for ‘ old woman ’ at me , by dragging two fingers down his face from his eyes , indicating bags and lines			0
if a male friend posted anything on @entity104 , @entity41 would shout : ‘ @entity105 ’ he said if @entity20 married him , she could have money ; if she refused , she must ‘ f * * * off ! ’ , and i must leave			1
‘ you ! ’ he said to me			0
‘ go south ! ’ he even erected a @entity112 sign in my garden			0
@entity30 believes that @entity41 close even erected a ' @entity112 ' sign in her garden and warned her that she should ' go south ' one weekend , he placed a sex toy on @entity20 ’s doorstep			1
he painted the word ‘ witch ’ on the side of my barn			1
he placed a dead rabbit on her doorstep			1
he would pin notes to our doors , accusing @entity20 of liking young boys , and to me he scrawled just two words : ‘ finished you			1
’ every time a note appeared , i got chest pains			2
he would get back to his farm late at night , having been drinking , and bang on @entity20 ’s front door			1
he would appear in my hallway uninvited			0
he made our lives in this seemingly idyllic , tranquil location , a living hell			0
@entity20 understandably became depressed , and was put on medication			2
she was too scared to leave her cottage , which was tricky , as her job is to look after animals			2
she threatened to kill herself			0
finally , she went to see @entity41 ’s sister , who lives four miles away			2
@entity20 did n’t want to involve the police , as @entity41 obviously needed help			1
the sister said she was afraid the situation would escalate , and that her brother would never change , but she would talk to him			0
meanwhile his mother said she was scared of him , as he once went for his ex-girlfriend with a pitchfork in front of her			0
but nonetheless his mother , when i asked for her help , also told me i should sell my house , as ‘ we were here first ’			2
@entity20 went to the family again			2
this time , the sister called the police			2
after many hours of taking statements , the police , who to their credit were endlessly sympathetic and helpful , gave @entity41 a harassment notice			1
they told us to get walkie - talkies ( there is scant mobile signal in our area ) , but what use i ’d be to @entity20 against a man who is 22st and over 6ft , i ’ve no idea			1
and of course he persisted with the stalking and the harassment , and so finally , last month , he was arrested and released on bail			0
a date for a court hearing was set			2
we discovered @entity41 had in fact been cautioned before for a very similar offence , and so it seemed likely he would receive a custodial sentence , or be made to relocate			1
when @entity20 and i were told this , we said to each other : how will six months in prison help him ? he will just be released and do it again			1
in court last monday , @entity41 pleaded guilty			1
and the sentence ? he was ordered to pay £ 100 and given a restraining order			1
that is less than i was fined for speeding			2
in court , his defence lawyer stated that ‘ there ’s a certain economy of words in the deaf community that outsiders can find brutally frank ’			2
i think those texts were very , very clear			0
@entity30 said @entity41 appeared in court last monday for stalking and harassment and received a £ 100 fine to top it all , i ’ve just received a letter from the family ’s solicitor , saying i am not to talk to @entity41 because ‘ he is a vulnerable adult handicapped by his inability to hear , he is easily harmed and the harm can be reflected in his behaviour ’			1
to me , this clearly implies that his two latest victims are in fact responsible ! there has been no apology , and our horses now face eviction from his field			0
if @entity20 was to do what @entity41 ’s ex did , and move away , she ’d lose her job			1
we thought about renting her a cottage in a nearby village , but she feels he would only find her again			0
i have only ever waved hello to him , given him a cheery thumbs - up for slowing his tractor when i am walking my dogs , and ordered him pizza after a hard day ’s sheep shearing			0
making excuses for and underestimating his behaviour is unhelpful to all involved ; and as a vulnerable adult , surely he should n’t be living with barely any human contact ? and what about my employee ? she is a vulnerable adult : she is depressed and often here alone , as i have to travel to work			0
@entity30 said that @entity41 's family said that she could sell her house was they ' were here first ' giving @entity41 a restraining order is a joke			1
he ignored the last one			0
even last week he has been ducking behind his @entity253 , spying on @entity20			2
in our rare lighter moments , @entity20 will joke , as she heads outside in a floor - length coat and hat , wellies , no make - up , hair scragged back , ‘ could i be any less attractive ? ’ even a burka is no defence against male fantasy			2
men who abuse women are often victims , too			0
@entity41 has no boundaries : he even asked @entity20 what type of tampon she uses , and her method of contraception			1
he was set up , alone , in a remote farm 20 years ago , which to me seems the worst possible solution for a man already isolated by his disability			0
we of course do n’t want the disabled in care homes or hospitals or institutions , but to leave them on their own , to prey on an unsuspecting neighbour ? what ever happened to the maiden aunt or bachelor uncle living with their family ? care in the community is clearly a joke			2
we have a stereotypical view of the abuser : a showbiz type who likes a bit of slap and tickle , an evil rapist			0
but often an abuser is just very sad			0
no man would want to behave in this way , surely ? all @entity41 wants is a wife , and to be looked after			2
i believe he is a nice person , generous and good with children			0
he has even been helpful , fetching a trailer when my thoroughbred had to be rushed to hospital			0
but he ca n’t control , on his own , his obsession			0
it is the right of my assistant and friend to live in peace , for her to do her job , and be without fear			0
it is the right of the stalker and abuser to get help			0
@entity30 said she feels sorry for @entity41 , suggesting that he should also receive the help he deserves			1

@entity30 and her employee @entity20 have been stalked by a farmer
@entity30 and @entity20 reported @entity41 to police over the intimidation and abuse
@entity20 found a dead rabbit left outside her doorstep and received foul texts
@entity30 discovered the word ' witch ' *daubed* on her wall and was told to leave
@entity30 bought her picturesque house in north @entity16 in october 2012
but since then relations with her farmer neighbour have soured
*mr* @entity41 appeared in court on monday and was fined £ 100 for the abuse
