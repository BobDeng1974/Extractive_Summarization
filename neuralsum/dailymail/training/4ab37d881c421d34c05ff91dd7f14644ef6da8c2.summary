' i understand this man was injured and i understand there is a system is in place for things like that and its this system that i think it flawed , because as a family , of course , in our eyes , had his son not murdered my brother , the police would n't have been there			1
' in our eyes , if this man decides to put some of that money away for when his son gets out , the murderer has benefited from @entity11 's death			1
' mr @entity10 was injured when officers raided his @entity70 flat while searching for his 18 - year - old son on the ­ morning after @entity11 ’s death			1
he said he was kicked in the eye and had his ankle broken as police handcuffed him to the ground , also claiming he suffered post traumatic stress			1
thug : @entity78 was one of three men jailed for @entity11 's murder police had a warrant for @entity78 ’s arrest , but he had already fled			1
a court was told last year that during the tense raid mr @entity10 ’s pitbull terrier was tasered and sprayed with a fire extinguisher			2
but @entity2 , who has campaigned against knife - crime , pointed out that the payment comes at a time when the public funding is already pushed to brink			2
she added : ' on a higher scale , this money comes out of public money and at a time when there are cuts to police , to @entity99 , the services that help victims when there 's charities out there that can not get a penny of funding to do work			0
' it just seems unjust to us - these are the things that go through your head as a family			2
' as i said , i know this man was injured , and there is a system for this but it just always seems - and we 've said it many times - the systems are not geared towards victims in many cases			0
for us , personally , its just heartbreaking			0
' she said : ' it 's tough because it 's not just my family , there are so many out there and that 's the thing , you try and be positive and try and make a difference in some way and this just brings it all back			0
' for us there 's always something else that brings it all back			0
' it does make it harder , ' she added before apologising as she wiped away her tears			0

while the @entity157 do not deny that mr @entity10 was injured , or even that he should have the right to compensation , they were horrified at the ­ discrepancy ­ between his payout and theirs , which was spent on @entity11 ’s funeral			1
calling for change : @entity2 said the justice system is n't always geared towards helping the victims ' unfair ' : @entity167 , pictured left , and her husband @entity169 , pictured right , said they believe the discrepancy between the two payments is ' unjust and unfair ' speaking on this morning , @entity11 's father @entity169 said : ' the money that we got , just about paid for our son 's funeral			1
it 's not about the money , it 's about the principal of it all			0
' we are not disputing that he is n't entitled to compensation , what we are trying to say is , there should be more help for the families of victims of crime than there is at the moment ' we 'd like to see a balance where each case is treated on equal term			0
' it 's not just our family			0
its all the victims of knife and violent crime			0
the law is so unjust and unfair			0
' mother @entity167 added : ' it 's like a slap in the face			2
' we are talking about murder			0
my son was murdered and i feel that he 's [ @entity35 ] benefited from my son 's murder			2
' we struggle to get out of bed some mornings			0
you are worn out ... we spend a lot of time thinking about @entity11 and how he would 've been - as do other parents who have lots their child to a violent murder			1
' it really is unfair			0
we 're all in it together and we gain our strength from one another			0
