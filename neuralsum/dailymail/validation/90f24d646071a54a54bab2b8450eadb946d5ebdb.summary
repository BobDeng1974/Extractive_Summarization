we spend hundreds or thousands of pounds on holidays that whisk us away from ' everyday life ' to far - off places that provide the ultimate escape			0
but one designer believes people can find that escape with a unique - and cheaper - experience that allows them to fall in love again with the landscape that is around them every day			1
@entity12 's proposed ' 15 - minute vacations ' would be carried out on an extendable balcony that lifts visitors some 30ft into the air for an alternative view			0
@entity17 designer @entity12 believes his extendable balconies would help people to better appreciate the cities they live in the @entity17 designer believes seeing the sights from a different vantage point can eliminate the need to travel abroad the 36 - year - old @entity17 's concept creates temporary instruments for a holiday without the need to travel			1
speaking to @entity28 , mr @entity12 said : ' we spend more and more time working - at the same time the affordable space for living , and therefore relaxation is decreasing			2
' @entity33 tend to travel overseas whenever they get the time without even knowing their own country			0
' this concept aims to help you see your own area or town from a different perspective			0
' the platform situated at the top of the lifting mechanism can be designed to the operator 's specifications @entity12 's ' 15 - @entity47 ' are carried out on an extendable balcony that lifts visitors 30ft into the air for an alternative view within a few seconds the machine converts the familiar environment into a new experience for 15 minutes			2
the location is not fixed - but cities like @entity57 and @entity58 are the target group since private space in those cities is limited and potential holiday spots can be far out of town			1
' for just a short time , perhaps in your lunch break , you create a new and exciting situation by just shifting the perspective , ' added mr @entity12			2
people in cities such as @entity57 and @entity58 are considered the target group , as their personal space is ' limited ' the @entity17 anticipates the platforms will be hired locally , and the furniture on top can include dining areas and gardens , which will be owned by the city or private operator			1
prices will vary from city to city , and will be dependent on the type of platform chosen , and what facilities are on offer , he added			0
