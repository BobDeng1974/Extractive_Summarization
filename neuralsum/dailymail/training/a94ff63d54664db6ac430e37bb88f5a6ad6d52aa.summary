it was a money - making opportunity that could have gone either way - and could have only have been pulled off by the most tech - savvy of people			2
a college student has somehow been able to amass over $ 24,000 by waving a sign at a television camera			1
the hopeful venture started on saturday with the @entity9 show @entity8 , a football program that is filmed at a different campus each weekend and was in @entity11 , @entity12			1
the student came armed with a banner that had seemed to plea for money from his mother			1
it also included the logo for @entity19 , a @entity20 payment network , and a qr code , which is a scan - sensitive icon used to represent information , according to @entity24			1
clever currency : a joke by a college student ( pictured in yellow ) , who held up a sign on tv with the details to an online banking network , really paid off - literally - with the guy garnered over $ 24,000 in donations close up : the sign , which was seemingly appealing to the students mother , contained the icon of ' crypto - currency ' network @entity19 ( right ) and a qr code ( left ) linking people to his account with the payment - sharing website qr codes often appear in magazines , allowing readers to link into websites with their phones for the purpose of online shopping and further reading , among other things			1
in this case the qr code was for the student 's @entity19 account , which is known as as an online ' wallet '			1
somehow a screen grab of the tv show showing the man holding the sign made its way to social news website @entity61			1
readers were able to enhance the @entity63 to identify the code , allowing them to donate money			0
as the story picked up traffic , more people started to give donations			2
what started out as a small amounts quickly saw the guy recieve 100 transactions in not time at all			0
as it stands the sign holder has received 22 bitcoins , which are worth over $ 1,100 each			2
the value of the received coins comes to a total of $ 24,361.50			1
while @entity19 makes all donations public , the identity of the people receiving funds are concealed behind their usernames			0
the student - has only been identified by his @entity61 username , @entity85 - uses the @entity19 user name ' @entity89 '			0
the proof is in the coins : a snapshot of the student 's @entity19 account , which is open to the public , shows he was received 22 @entity19 , worth over $ 1,100 each			1
the donation button ( bottom right ) is what people used to hand over donations			0
there have recently been calls for the payment network to change their privacy settings to protect users during the early stages of the incoming transactions , @entity106 said he would be donating the majority of the money to a charitable group called @entity112 , which is a homeless shelter and outreach group located in @entity114 , @entity115			1
it is not known at present how much of the money will be donated			0
the student said the whole instance started as a ' joke '			0
he had started a @entity19 wallet earlier this year by paying $ 101			2
when the amount ' grew rapidly ' over the coming months , he decided he would use the sign to see if anyone would donate to help the amount grow			0
@entity19 was launched five years and has come to known as ' crypto - currency '			0
bitcoin supports believe it could one day become the global alternative to cash			0
interestingly , the news comes as members of the finance world call for the privacy settings on @entity19 to be more stringent to protect users , specifically from the data mining of the @entity20 @entity138 spy agency			0
hackers are also constantly looking for ways to access people 's @entity19 wallets using the information offered to them online .			2
