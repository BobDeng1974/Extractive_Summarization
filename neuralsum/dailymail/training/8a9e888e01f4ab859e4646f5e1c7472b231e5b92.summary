a fit and healthy woman who took the contraceptive pill @entity2 has said that it was to blame for the life - shattering stroke she suffered			1
@entity6 was a high - flying career girl who had moved to @entity7 to pursue a career in @entity9 but just months later , after being prescribed the drug , she suffered a major stroke			1
@entity6 , 40 , has been left unable to use to her left arm , walk properly and suffers with poor short - term memory and moderate brain impairment			1
she also says that the stroke has caused havoc in her personal life – shattering her confidence and ultimately causing the breakdown of a relationship			2
@entity6 ( pictured after the stroke ) was prescribed the contraceptive pill @entity2 after being diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome			1
she suffered a stroke just four months later doctors were unable to confirm that @entity2 caused her stroke but they admitted that it probably played a role			1
thirteen years on , she is angry that more is n’t being done to eradicate the pill that remains widely prescribed to women both as a form of contraception and as a treatment for acne : ‘ so many women ’s lives are being put at risk and it should be banned			2
’ in february this year the @entity39 , announced that @entity2 would be investigated after it was linked to four deaths			1
regulators in @entity42 have since suspended sales of the hormone treatment			0
in the @entity47 , concerns about the drug were raised after the deaths of several young women , among them @entity50 , 16 , in 2011 who died from blood clot after taking @entity2 for a month			1
dianette - or @entity2 as it ’s known in @entity42 - is prescribed to more than 62,000 @entity47 women a year , usually for polycystic ovary syndrome ( @entity57 ) , a hormonal problem affecting young women which leads to multiple small ovarian cysts , irregular periods , acne and excess facial hair			1
in february the @entity39 announced that @entity2 would be investigated after it was linked to four deaths			1
regulators in @entity42 have ince suspended sales of the hormonal treatment it is a combination of two drugs - cyproterone ( a form of the female hormone progesterone ) and ethinylestradiol ( an oestrogen ) , which effectively suppress the effect of testosterone			0
as progesterone prevents ovulation , @entity2 also works as an effective contraceptive			1
while other oral contraceptives carry a small increased risk of blood clots - which can be dangerous and potentially fatal if they travel to the lungs or brain - the type of progesterone in @entity2 means the drug has one of the highest risks of blood clots of all oral contraceptives			1
@entity90 is 65 per cent more likely to cause a blood clot than @entity92 ( a type of progesterone found in older oral contraceptive pills ) , according to a review of 25 studies published last year in the @entity97			2
the @entity42 medicines agency last month revealed @entity2 is widely used as a contraceptive in @entity42			1
it is not clear what the situation is in the @entity47			0
the risk of a blood clot while taking @entity2 is , however , small			2
@entity6 has been left unable to use her left arm , walk or balance properly and suffers with poor short - term memory			1
she blames @entity2 for her stroke and is angry that it is still widely available around 40 of every 100,000 women on it develop a blood clot in one year , compared with between five and ten women in 100,000 who are not taking the drug , according to the @entity117 ( @entity118 )			1
before her a stroke , @entity6 was an avid sportsperson , regularly running , skiing and even taking part in swimming competitions			1
she had no history of strokes in her family , had normal blood pressure , enjoyed a healthy diet and never drank to excess			2
despite her fate , @entity6 ( pictured celebrating her 40th birthday ) is now managing to do more sport as she did before her stroke she moved to @entity132 in january 2001 and after some years of suffering with irregular periods she was diagnosed with @entity57			1
she was prescribed @entity2 and suffered no immediate side effects			1
but one night in june 2002 , @entity6 said she started to feel nauseous			2
she had enjoyed a couple of drinks and a meal out with friends and returned home sober that night			2
hours later she woke up to find herself on the floor next to her bed and unable to move			2
‘ i did n’t know what was going on and despite an overwhelming urge to get up , i simply could n’t move , ’ she said			0
’ @entity6 managed to reach her mobile phone and called her then boyfriend @entity147 who lived in @entity148 at the time			2
‘ he could tell there was something seriously wrong because i was slurring my words , so he called my two other flatmates , who were in neighbouring rooms , to find out what was wrong			0
' my flatmate came into my room , picked me up and put me on the bed			0
none of us for one second thought i ’d had a stroke – i was only 29			0
’ unsure of what had happened , @entity6 ’s flatmate took her to the nearest hospital			2
doctors immediately knew the cause of the symptoms			0
‘ my whole left side was paralysed and the first thing the consultant said to me was “ have you seen your mouth ? ”			0
it had drooped entirely , ’ she added			0
‘ i still could n’t quite get my head round the fact i had suffered a stroke though – it was something old people had and often they died			2
' this sort of thing was n’t meant to happen to people like me			0
’ @entity6 was also unable to recognise faces of close friends and doctors were concerned she would not be able to walk again			1
a raft of tests were carried out to discover how she could have suffered a stroke – they even thought she had a hole in her heart at one point - and although they could not confirm any obvious reason , the doctor said that @entity2 may have played a role			1
since her stroke , @entity6 has been reluctant to let the after effects of her stroke get in the way of enjoying her life			1
here she is pictured ( right ) in @entity205 and last year she even climbed @entity206 @entity6 then spend the next three months in hospital , with the first six weeks in @entity132 and the final in @entity209			1
she underwent intensive physiotherapy , speech therapy and since then has made a moderate recovery , although she still finds it very difficult to walk , balance , remember and still can not use her left arm			0
‘ i ’m managing to swim again , albeit with one arm , and i ’ve even tried adapted skis so i can get myself back on the slopes			0
‘ but i ’m angry – and i ’m even angrier that the pill is temporarily banned in @entity42 and not more widely			0
’ @entity6 , who now works in the charity sector , said that the stroke has caused her to mourn the life she once had			1
@entity50 , 16 , had been taking @entity2 for around four weeks before she died from an undiagnosed deep vein thrombosis ‘ you end up almost grieving yourself and to be honest i do n’t think i ’ve ever properly get over it – i ’ll just get on with it			2
‘ the after - effects of a stroke affect your confidence so much and the frustration of not being able to do the things you once took for granted changes your personality			0
' i try to be positive but i 'd be lying if i said i was n't sometimes sad about the way things have turned out			0
’ indeed the emotional strain of the stroke caused her relationship to @entity147 to break down and she say she is not confident she will ever find another partner again			0
‘ i ’ve tried dating websites but it can be tremendously frightening			0
' you worry you ’re going to be judged for having a limp and i ’m a bit slower on the uptake which can make conversations more difficult			0
' but @entity6 's main concern is now to raise awareness about @entity2 and stop more women using it			1
' a risk is there and it should n't be - especially if women are prescribed it so routinely			0
i want it to banned			0
' in a statement , @entity258 , the manufacturer of @entity2 , said : ' based on the currently available clinical data , the benefit - risk profile of @entity2 is favourable			2
we will continue to provide information that supports healthcare providers and their patients in making informed decisions			0
' the arterial thromboembolism ( @entity269 ) risk ( which includes stroke ) is slightly increased for womentaking @entity272 ( @entity273 ) when compared with non-users			0
' @entity2 acts as a combined oral contraceptive but should not be used solely as an oral contraceptive			1
' it should only be used for the treatment of severe acne if prolonged antibiotic therapy has failed or for the treatment of excess facial hair			0
' the slight increase risk of @entity269 is a well known class effect of @entity285 and is clearly stated in the patient information leaflet of all @entity285			0
