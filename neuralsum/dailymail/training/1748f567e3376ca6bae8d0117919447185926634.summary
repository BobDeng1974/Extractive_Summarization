former @entity1 spin doctor @entity0 was forced to resign for smearing opposition mps while working for @entity3 @entity4 was always the first down the pub for a drink and a gossip but now spends his time ‘ walking round @entity11 in a suit approaching people like a @entity14 ’ , a disgraced former colleague has claimed			1

but mr @entity0 , who was forced to resign for smearing @entity20 mps while working for mr @entity3 , said mr @entity4 now had far too many people around him ‘ saying he should do this or do that ’ which was stopping him from being himself			1
mr @entity0 said one of the @entity15 ’s greatest assets was that he was normal but was making ‘ ludicrous ’ decisions which were harming his chances of making it to @entity30			1
the former @entity32 aide , speaking to @entity34 radio , also criticised mr @entity4 ’s conference speech – accusing him of forgetting to mention the deficit because he believes it ’s @entity38 ’ responsibility			1
he also hit out at the ‘ unnecessary ’ anecdotes which mr @entity4 littered through his address about meeting ordinary people			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ i did n’t think it was his best week			1
’ he said he should have come out and said : ‘ look it is my programme for government , this is what i want ’			0
but he said mr @entity4 got ‘ muddled up with all this stuff about wandering around @entity11 and @entity48 and meeting people ’			1
he added : ‘ that was just unnecessary			0
’ he said the @entity1 leader was much more normal than he came across , adding : ‘ i tell you what he does n’t show that side of himself			0
’ mr @entity0 added that this was ‘ the best , almost the great thing , about him			1
’ he said : ‘ @entity4 ’s a fantastic gossip , he is one of those people always wanting to know which civil servants were going out which civil servants , and if someone had had a break up and , you know , what happened and you know , was so and so cheating on so and so			2
‘ he was interested in people and a very funny guy ; a very dry wit and you do n’t see that at all			0
that does n’t come a cross and i think he needs to do more			0
’ asked if he had ever seen mr @entity4 drunk , mr @entity0 said : ‘ probably not drunk , i think he handles his drink quite well			1
’ but he said on one foreign trip with @entity3 ‘ @entity4 was the man in charge deciding what we were all doing and every night he was the person saying , “ right down to the bar at seven o’clock ” and choosing where we would go to for dinner and that sort of thing ’			2
he added : ‘ he is very sociable			0
’ mr @entity0 said the @entity1 leader and his shadow chancellor @entity38 were ‘ two lively guys and they were very close at that time ’			1
but he said that mr @entity4 had changed after his spin doctors had got hold of him			1
he said : ‘ the only time i met @entity4 in the last five years was wondering around a park			2
‘ he was out pushing his daughter in a pram with his wife			0
‘ i was coming up to this guy and i thought , you want to be the prime minister and you are wearing a light orange t - shirt and some luminous pink shorts and i just wanted to say to him , “ you have got to start dressing better if you are going out in public ”			0
‘ i think he now walks around @entity11 in a suit approaching people like a @entity14 asking what they think about our country ’s future			1
’ mr @entity4 and his shadow chancellor @entity38 were ‘ two lively guys and they were very close ’ when they worked for @entity3 at the @entity110 mr @entity0 said the @entity1 ’s leader ’s conference speech gaffe , when he forgot to mention the deficit , was ‘ a revealing slip ’			1
he said : ‘ as far as he is concerned the deficit is @entity38 problem			0
he think @entity38 has to deal with that			0
’ mr @entity0 added that the @entity1 leader also feels ‘ uncomfortable with the question of immigration ’			2
‘ as the son of immigrants he feels positive about immigration and feels uncomfortable with aping the @entity125 rhetoric , ’ he said			0
but mr @entity0 said the @entity1 leader needed to ditch his gang of spin doctors			1
he said : ‘ he has too many people around him saying he should do this or do that			0
‘ when @entity131 was about to become prime minister , he had one person around him – @entity133			0
in the days before @entity3 became @entity135 , that was my job			2
@entity4 has literally a dozen people advising him on the @entity137 and that is too many			2
‘ you get pulled in all different directions			0
that leads to ludicrous things like @entity143 embarrassing him because he did n’t wear this wristband doing @entity145			0
