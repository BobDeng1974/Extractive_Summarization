by @entity0 published : 03:57 est , 27 april 2012 updated : 03:59 est , 27 april 2012 our solar system could have a ' twin ' 130 light years away - with up to nine planets including ' rocky ' planets like our own earth			1
the star system @entity8 had five confirmed planets - and a new study has confirmed two more , with another two suspected			1
most are liable to be ' scorchingly ' hot			2
astronomer @entity11 re-analysed data taken of star hd 10180 with @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , a high - precision camera mounted on a 3.6 meter telescope in @entity17 record beater : this animation shows an artist 's impression of the remarkable planetary system around the @entity23 ' the data indicates that there are not only seven but likely as many as nine planets in the system , ' said @entity11 told @entity28			2
' the two new planets appear to have orbital periods of roughly 10 and 68 days and masses of 1.9 and 5.1 times that of @entity33 , which enables the classification of them as hot super-earths , i.e. , planets with likely scorchingly hot rocky surfaces			1
' our solar system has eight planets after @entity42 was officially demoted to dwarf planet status			0
the staar has been studied for years because at 130 light years away it is relatively close and therefore brighter and easier for astronomers to examine			1
recent studies detected that the star , which is in the constellation of the water snake @entity52 , hosted six planets and observed a possible seventh planet			1
however , the latest research confirmed the existence of the seventh planet and found a further two planets orbiting the star			2
extraordinary : new findings show that the sun - like star could have nine planets orbiting around it the planets vary drastically in size and include one which is 65 times the @entity33 ’s mass and one estimated to be only 1.4 times heavier than @entity33 - making it one of the smallest planets discovered outside our own solar system			0
the two newly discovered planets weigh in at 1.9 times and 5.1 times heavier than @entity33 , ' enabling the classification of them as super-earths , ' says the study			0
the new planets follow hot orbits , circling their star in under 10 days for the small one , and 68 days for the larger			0
artist 's impression : the oft - examined star is 130 light years away and in the constellation of @entity52 , the water snake competition : if the findings are proved @entity8 's solar system will have more planets than ours since @entity42 has been demoted to a dwarf planet one of the new planets to be discovered and the seventh planet which was confirmed are particularly close to the sun - like star			1
the one with a mass of 1.3 times more than @entity33 is only 3 million km away from @entity8 , closer than mercury is to the sun , making its surface hot enough to melt zinc , tin and possibly even iron			1
the study explained that the star was a ‘ very quiet one ’ making it unlikely that the activity of the two new planets that they detected was caused by stellar phenomena			0
‘ also , the periodicities we report , namely 9.66 and 67.6 days , do not coincide with any periodicities arising from the movement of the bodies in the solar system			0
therefore , we consider the interpretation of these two new signals of being of planetary origin to be the most credible explanation , ' the study continued			0
other solar systems generally have four or less planets orbiting a star .			0

@entity8 lies just 130 light years away in the constellation of @entity52
@entity127 confirmed planets with two more likely *candidates*
