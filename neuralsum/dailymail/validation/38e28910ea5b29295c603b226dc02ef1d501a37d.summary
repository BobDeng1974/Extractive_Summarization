@entity1 manager @entity0 feels @entity2 is more deserving of a place in @entity6 's @entity5 squad than @entity8 's @entity7			1
@entity2 has missed out on @entity6 's latest @entity5 squad for the upcoming @entity11 qualifier against @entity12 and friendly with @entity13 , despite accumulating 15 @entity15 goals this season – just one fewer than @entity7 , who is set to earn his first senior cap			1
the former @entity20 man 's goal haul puts him above the other three strikers in @entity6 's squad – @entity23 ( 11 ) , @entity24 ( 4 ) and @entity25 ( 3 ) – and @entity0 thinks @entity2 's ability to score goals in a relegation - threatened side makes him more deserving of an @entity5 call - up			1
@entity2 ( left ) was left out of the @entity5 squad on thursday , but @entity7 ( right ) made the cut @entity1 manager @entity0 believes that @entity33 should have been included in the 24 - man group ' @entity2 has been fantastic this season his work - rate has been unbelievable and he has the uncoachable thing of being able to score goals ' @entity0 said ahead of @entity6 's announcement			1
' i am sure he will be in the reckoning for the squad			0
' when asked if @entity2 deserved his chance as much as @entity7 , the @entity1 boss added : ' even more so because he is doing it in a team that is struggling at the foot of the table and he has still scored quite a few goals this season			2
@entity50 , @entity51 and @entity53 mess around ahead of @entity1 training at @entity55 on thursday the @entity1 players warm up at their cold training base on thursday as they prepare to face @entity58 @entity53 tries to pull off an audacious flicked effort at goal but sees his path blocked by @entity62 @entity63 practices his heading during training as he prepares to face @entity58 striker @entity66 @entity67 flies in for a tackle on @entity69 as @entity1 look to up the tempo to avoid relegation the @entity1 boss said he felt @entity2 's work for a team struggling in the @entity15 deserved more credit ' it goes to show that he is a quality player and he will shine regardless of where he plays			2
' @entity1 face @entity58 on sunday , with the @entity58 now the only @entity78 side left in @entity79 following @entity81 's exit at the hands of @entity83 on wednesday evening			0
@entity81 followed @entity84 and @entity85 out of the @entity86 at the last 16 stage , but @entity0 believes the @entity15 's shortcomings in the competition is merely a ' blip '			1
@entity6 picked four strikers among the 24 players he went with , but there was no room for @entity33 the @entity1 forward has netted just one @entity15 goal less than @entity5 rival @entity7 this season @entity0 said that @entity33 will shine wherever he plays and that he was sure he could make the next selection @entity7 celebrates scoring against @entity1 at @entity97 which helped lead to his @entity5 call - up @entity6 went with @entity24 , @entity23 , @entity25 and @entity7 as his striking options ' @entity81 did not have their best game , ' @entity0 said			1
' but they all have gone out of the @entity86 at a late stage			0
' not making it to the last eight is a blip for this country because over the past few years we have got to the latter stages , but now and again this happens			0
' i still think this is the best league in the world and where everyone wants to really come and play			0
we can see that by the amount of overseas players and managers that we have in this league			0
' @entity119 and @entity81 were sent packing from the @entity86 by @entity83 @entity120 's @entity84 were also knocked out but @entity0 believes it is just a ' blip ' for @entity78 clubs in @entity79			2

@entity6 did not pick @entity1 striker @entity2 in his @entity5 squad
@entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity7 made it
but @entity33 has more goals than all of them this season , bar @entity7
his manager @entity0 believes he should have been in the squad
@entity0 thinks @entity5 's poor @entity86 show is just a ' blip '
