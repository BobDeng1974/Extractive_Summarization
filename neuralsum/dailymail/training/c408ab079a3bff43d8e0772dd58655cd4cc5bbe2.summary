motorists are facing the threat of fuel shortages and £ 100 fill - ups after one of @entity6 ’s biggest refineries went bust yesterday			1
as well as posing a serious risk to forecourt supplies , retailers say it could see petrol prices soaring to record highs as speculators and profiteers capitalise on the disruption			1
diesel prices in particular are set to rise by up to 3p to a record £ 1.45 a litre , they warn			1
that would mean more than £ 100 to fill up a typical family saloon with a 70 - litre tank			1
mps and unions joined the chorus warning of shortages while forecourt bosses said there was a risk of parts of the @entity30 ‘ grinding to a halt ’ after supplies from the giant @entity33 in @entity34 were suspended			1
crisis looms : mps and forecourt bosses warned parts of the @entity30 could ' grind to a halt ' amid reports production had stopped at the giant @entity33 in @entity34 , pictured motoring misery : petrol retailers have warned that the crisis could cause snaking queues and chaos on the forecourts as pumps run dry no petrol , diesel or other products , including bitumen for road building , were leaving the site yesterday			1
the action came when the refinery ’s owner ran out of cash and was unable to extend its credit facilities			1
administrator @entity60 said it had no idea when supplies would resume but was ‘ talking to customers ’			2
@entity65 supplies around 10 per cent of the @entity6 ’s petrol and diesel , and 20 per cent of the total in the @entity30			1
the warnings came as @entity65 ’s swiss - parent company @entity70 filed for bankruptcy with the threat to up to 1,000 @entity6 jobs at the former @entity75 - owned refinery			1
a separate strike by more than 80 tanker drivers at the @entity79 refinery in @entity80 , which supplies around 340 jet filling stations , is exacerbating supply concerns			2
but energy ministers and oil industry bosses said they were doing their best to make up the shortfall from the @entity6 ’s seven remaining refineries and by buying in from abroad			2
a sudden rush to the pumps , however , could trigger filling stations running dry			2
@entity60 said refining was continuing at @entity65 but supplies were being stored rather than being sent out			2
it could not say when normal service would resume			2
@entity94 , joint administrator and @entity60 partner , said : ‘ our immediate priority is to continue to operate the @entity65 refinery and the @entity100 oil storage business without disruption while the financial position is clarified and restructuring options are explored			1
’ warning : @entity106 @entity105 mep @entity104 said he did n't want to be alarmist but said that the suspension could impact the @entity108 the government insisted it was doing all it could to find a buyer			1
profiteers and speculators in the energy markets are already poised to capitalise on the problems to push up wholesale prices which will mean hefty increases at the pumps , say petrol retailers			1
even before the latest crisis , the @entity119 had warned that motorists were on course for a 2p a litre fuel price hike at the pumps – adding £ 1.40 to the fill - up for a @entity126			1
the @entity65 crisis could see that rise even higher , say retailers			1
record pump prices set on may 9 , 2011 were 137.43p a litre for petrol and 143.04p for diesel – or just over £ 100 to fill up a new @entity126 with a 70 - litre tank			1
if diesel hits £ 1.45 a litre it will cost £ 101.50 per fill - up			1
yesterday diesel averaged 142.21p a litre in the @entity6 – less than 1p off the record – and means it currently costs £ 99.50 to fill up a @entity126			1
@entity140 , at 133.89p yesterday , is 3.54p a litre off the may record			2
forecourts fear a repeat of the crisis which caused chaos in @entity147 in 2008 when the giant @entity149 refinery was hit by strike action – leading to pumps running dry , ‘ sold out ’ signs , and some cases of petrol rationing north of the border			2
@entity155 said : ‘ the message for motorists in the area is a simple one – do n’t panic buy and potentially create a problem			0
’ @entity106 @entity105 mep @entity104 said : ‘ i do n’t want to be alarmist about this , but i do n’t want to be dishonest either			0
supplies across @entity162 and the @entity30 could be affected and i have been told this could impact the @entity108			1
’ panic stations : the refinery supplies 20 per cent of the petrol used in @entity162 and the @entity30 as well as other areas around the @entity6 @entity65 has refining capacity for ten million tonnes of crude oil per year			0
some 36 per cent of its output is petrol and 27 per cent diesel , the rest a mixture of other fuels			2
fears petrol supplies could run out grew as tanker drivers went on strike at the @entity79 refinery in @entity181 , @entity80			0
@entity79 supplies around 340 jet filling stations , of which the majority are in the @entity185 and @entity186 , but 66 are in the @entity30			0
the drivers are employed by delivery firm @entity188 and members of the giant @entity192 union			0
a union spokesman at the @entity195 - @entity194 at @entity181 said : ' no tankers have passed through the picket line and six or seven have turned back			0
' the strike involves 123 tanker drivers at three @entity195 sites in total : @entity181 ; the @entity203 oil terminal in @entity204 and a site in @entity206 in the @entity207			0
@entity140 ’s @entity208 said : ' we are faced with a double whammy			0
the @entity79 strike started at 5am when more than 80 drivers walked out and joined the picket line			0
' he said shortages would push up the price of fuel as traders and speculators exploit the situation for profit			2
but if the administrators shut down the refinery at @entity65 ' then we ’re into a totally different ball game			0
' there are seven other refineries in the @entity6 – at @entity79 and @entity228 , both in @entity80 ; @entity229 , near @entity230 ; @entity149 , near @entity231 ; @entity232 in @entity233 ; and @entity234 and @entity235 , both in @entity236			0
@entity70 previously owned a refinery in @entity100 , which closed in 2009			1
adding to supply woes is a strike by tanker drivers at the @entity79 refinery which supplies around 340 jet filling stations , of which the majority are in the @entity185 and @entity186			0
instability in @entity246 and its threat to block key oil tanker routes in the @entity249 , coupled with the strong dollar , is also storing up trouble , retailers warned			2
the @entity6 has 8,500 filling stations of which 2,132 are in the @entity30			0
of these , about 600 are @entity75 and @entity254 sites supplied from @entity65			0
@entity70 reported a net loss of £ 265million in the first nine months of last year , while in december its banks withdrew a £ 675million portion of its £ 1.29billion credit facility			1
the other main supplier for the @entity30 and @entity162 is the @entity261 refinery in @entity229			0
a @entity263 spokesman said it was helping to look for buyers but that the ‘ immediate priority ’ was to keep the @entity65 refinery and @entity100 storage business operating ’			0
he added : ‘ in the short term , companies have made alternative arrangements to ensure adequate supplies of products are available in the @entity30			0
’ @entity70 had been increasingly relying on its @entity6 offshoot for funds			1
at the end of 2009 , it owed the @entity6 arm £ 42million			0
but by the end of 2010 the @entity282 company ’s borrowings from its @entity6 subsidiary had ballooned to £ 114million			0
the company ’s fate was sealed when 13 banks , including @entity288 , @entity289 and @entity290 , froze a $ 1billion loan that was keeping it going			0
global accountancy giant @entity60 has been appointed administrator for the @entity6 companies .			0
