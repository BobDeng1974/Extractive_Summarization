by @entity0 an excellent strike from @entity2 was n't enough for @entity3 as the @entity4 continued their search for a first pre-season victory following a 2 - 1 defeat by @entity8			1
the @entity4 had taken the lead in the 55th minute through @entity2 - his first goal since his recent arrival from @entity12			1

but @entity8 soon hit back as goals from @entity45 three minutes later and a @entity51 strike five minutes from time helped turn the game around in the @entity60 side 's favour			0
the @entity4 were also left to reflect on missed chances with @entity19 seeing his first - half penalty , which he won after being brought down , saved			0
@entity23 was also forced off injured in the first half joining @entity64 and @entity65 in nursing niggles at the right back position			0
@entity3 's latest defeat in @entity69 follows a 2 - 0 loss by 1860 @entity71 as well as a 1 - 1 draw with @entity73			1
despite failing to win any of their three pre-season games in the country , @entity4 fans will take positives from @entity2 's contribution after a precise strike gave @entity18 ' side the lead at the @entity82			1
the former @entity12 forward showed neat skill to beat his marker from the edge of the box , before quickly firing a snap shot past the stranded @entity8 keeper 10 minutes after the break			2
a @entity45 header saw @entity8 quickly hit back and after @entity2 departed in favour of @entity28 , the @entity4 soon began to tire			0
tussle : @entity3 's @entity93 battles for the ball with @entity8 's @entity95 scenic : @entity3 's pre-season friendly with @entity8 came from the @entity82 a build up of @entity8 pressure finally became too much for the @entity4 as @entity51 raced through on goal in the final five minutes to tuck a neat finish under @entity102			1
@entity3 's lack of match fitness will concern @entity18 , but the @entity4 still have four pre-season friendlies to play against @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and a return to @entity69 when they take on @entity110 .			2
