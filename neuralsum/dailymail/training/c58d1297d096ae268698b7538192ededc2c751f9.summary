they showed some sitting on his lap and in one snapshot he is pictured with his eyes closed and his hand inside a woman 's t - shirt			1
the images were printed over eleven pages which ran them under the headline : ' @entity28			0
' unusually for @entity2 - who is currently involved in four trials - he appeared in court as a victim as he brought the civil case against the former editor			1
it was later revealed all the women were aspiring tv starlets with one being identified as @entity38 , 39 , a former @entity39 contestant			0
the media tycoon turned politician told the court in @entity43 : ' holding hands with my guests is something i do all the time			1
it 's normal for me to do that , to make my guests feel at ease			1
' he added of the photographs , which were published in 2007 by @entity12 's then editor @entity54 : ' the way they were presented as ' @entity2 's harem ' was totally different to reality			2
' the pictures were taken by @entity60 at @entity61 , @entity2 's luxury home near @entity62 on the island of @entity64 , a well known millionaire 's playground where he has entertained several high profile international political guests over the years			1
@entity61 : @entity70 's luxury holiday home in @entity64 where he entertained women and was pictured by a magazine among them were @entity74 and his wife @entity75 who famously spent the weekend with @entity2 in the summer of 2004 , just hours after he had undergone a hair transplant and he was snapped alongside the couple wearing a bandanna			2
they were treated to a spectacular fireworks display which ended with the words ' @entity81 ' lighting up the night sky - and neighbours complaining about the noise from the eruption that was produced from a specially built fake volcano			2
@entity2 added : ' the way the pictures were taken , they deliberately excluded images of male guests because the photographer was looking for a sale			2
accusations : prostitute @entity96 , left , claims she taped herself having sex with @entity2 , who has been linked with @entity99 @entity96 ' to take the pictures that he did he would have to have come onto the property - it would not have been possible any other way			0
