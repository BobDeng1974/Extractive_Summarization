by @entity0 published : 11:42 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 17:02 est , 1 october 2013 the ship ’s captain portrayed by @entity3 in a forthcoming @entity5 movie is at the centre of a $ 50million lawsuit – brought by the very men whose lives he is credited with saving			1
according to legal papers seen by @entity19 , the true story of the @entity12 – the @entity14 cargo vessel captured by @entity16 pirates in the @entity17 four years ago – is not a simple narrative of captain @entity22 ’s personal sacrifice in the face of extreme danger			1
instead it is a story of corporate greed and hubris , in which @entity22 captained his ship against more than seven maritime warnings and his own men 's pleas , sailing deep into waters notorious for pirate attack			1
hostage to fortune : a still from ' @entity44 , ' shows @entity3 as the lead of the title , but was it bad luck or bad judgement that put the @entity50 and her crew in peril ? speaking to @entity19 , attorney @entity54 , who first brought the 11 men ’s claims in 2009 , said : ‘ he put them in harm ’s way and they suffered as a result and were hurt as a result			1
‘ it is galling for them to see @entity44 being set up as a hero			2
it is just horrendous and they ’re angry			0
’ the @entity12 came under pirate attack on 8 april 2009			1
for the 20 strong crew and their captain that was the first of a five day ordeal			2
captain @entity22 offered himself as a hostage in return for his crew ’s safety			1
ten hours into the hijack , with the @entity50 under pirate control , crew members managed to take a prisoner of their own with sheer ' brute force			1
' by luck they taken the pirates ' leader			2
speaking shortly after the attack second engineer , @entity89 recalled : ‘ right then and there we had a chip			0
they came on with a plan and now their plan was disrupted			0
’ @entity97 's welcome : a weary captain @entity22 is met by his children at @entity101 airport on 17 april 2009			1
his ordeal ended five days earlier , when @entity104 snipers shot three of his pirate captors dead safe harbour : a team tow the @entity12 lifeboat on which @entity44 was held captive to assault vessel @entity109 on 12 april 2009 it meant that @entity44 was able to offer the pirates an exit strategy – a hostage swap and a lifeboat for a clean get away			1
but the agreement was not honoured by the pirates			2
instead , after securing the return of their leader they took off with captain @entity22 as hostage			2
the drama unfolded on news networks across @entity14 and beyond			0
the @entity12 was the first @entity14 vessel to be taken in these waters and now its captain ’s life hung in the balance			2
president @entity131 meets captain @entity22 and wife @entity132 in the @entity133 in may 2009			1
the president praised @entity22 's heroism as an example to all his story of survival , of attempted escape , beatings and ultimately liberation by @entity104 snipers was compelling and inspiring			2
president @entity131 went as far as to commend the captain and issue the statement : ‘ i share the country ’s admiration for the bravery of @entity44 and his selfless concern for his crew			0
’ he added : ‘ his courage is a model for all @entity14			0
’ in the days that followed captain @entity22 's dramatic rescue , this quiet family man from @entity101 , married to a nurse , @entity132 , was much feted			1
the making of a hero : @entity3 poses with ' real life hero ' @entity44 on the cover of @entity158			0
the 58 - year - old father of two , originally from @entity160 , was praised as the epitome of an ordinary hero : a veritable @entity163 who had heroism thrust upon him by circumstance			0
and he had shown great courage			0
he had stepped up to the mark and placed himself between the pirates and his crew			2
he had shown an instinct to protect and survive			0
the immediate aftermath was filled with jubilation and relief at @entity22 's and his crew ’s safe return			1
they made the arduous trip home from @entity178 , @entity179 on 12 april			0
and , once there , the decisions that had put them in such danger in the first place passed with little mention , publicly at least			0
but that chain of cause and effect was always bound to be scrutinised			0
@entity189 months of the ship 's return lawsuits were in motion			0
the suits are not being brought against @entity44 personally			0
instead they are being brought against the ship - owners , @entity196 and the crew ’s employers @entity199			0
but the ‘ hurt and anger ’ described by @entity202 , and experienced by her clients is personal			0
speaking on behalf of her clients , mrs @entity54 said : ‘ the crew had begged captain @entity22 not to go so close to the @entity16 coast			1
' he told them he would n’t let pirates scare him or force him to sail away from the coast			1
’ in the two days before the @entity12 was taken , two other vessels had come under pirate attack in the @entity17 prompting official maritime safety groups to issue warnings			1
' the crew begged him not to go so close to the @entity16 coast ... he told them he would n't let pirates scare him			1
' attorney @entity54 @entity219 among those advisory notices was , according to the lawsuits , one issued ‘ on or about april 6 , 2009			2
’ then , maritime authorities issued a warning to ‘ sail at least 600 ( nautical ) miles off the coast of @entity16 because pirates were in the region and taking hostage ships and their crews			1
’ ‘ in spite of the notices and warnings , ’ the suit continues , the decision was made ‘ to sail @entity12 within approximately 250 ( nautical ) miles off the coast of @entity16			1
easy target : the @entity12 was well beyond the distance from the @entity16 coast designated ' safe ' by @entity238 authorities when pirates struck three members of the special @entity104 escort that ensured the @entity12 's safe passage to @entity179 stand aboard the beleaguered vessel the @entity12 arrives in @entity179 on 11 april 2009			1
captain @entity22 returned one day later			2
in the foreground the hundreds of the world 's media wait and watch the end of the enthralling drama @entity104 records place the @entity12 just 240 nautical miles off the coast when it came under attack			1
it was , according to mrs @entity54 , ‘ a purely financial , business decision , ’ to take such a hazardous course in the face of increased pirate activities in those waters and repeated warnings			2
the @entity12 was heading to @entity178 , @entity179 , carrying 17,000 tons of cargo – much of it aid destined for @entity179 , @entity16 and @entity260			1
sailing the safe distance from the coast would add a day to the trip and use extra fuel and manpower			0
a bridge too far : a still from ' @entity44 ' recreates the terrifying moment @entity16 pirates took control of the @entity12 troubled waters : an image taken two months before the @entity12 was seized shows @entity16 pirates surrendering to a @entity104 patrol in the @entity17 at a time when pirate activity was known to be on the rise mrs @entity54 said : ‘ @entity44 made that trip all the time			1
his decision was signed off by @entity50 absolutely			2
there ’s a constant communication between the bridge and the outside world			0
the company knew precisely what was going on and captain @entity22 was absolutely aware of the warnings			1
’ as for @entity50 and @entity199 , the suits allege both , ‘ knowingly , intentionally and wilfully sent their employees into an area where pirates were attaching merchant vessels … exposing their employees to grave danger			1
’ it has taken the 11 , four years of fighting to secure trial dates			0
the same amount of time it took @entity44 to secure a book deal and see that book turned into a movie			0
mrs @entity54 said : ‘ they fought and fought but we finally got everyone to agree on the jurisdiction of this suit			0
at one point we were lodging papers in @entity309 , @entity12 and @entity310			2
’ now @entity19 has learned the cases are set to be heard in @entity312 , @entity12 in december			1
. in the prelude to his eponymous movie ‘ @entity44 ’ has said : ‘ most heroes do n’t have a choice			0
they just do the best they can			0
’ but mrs @entity54 is quite clear that there was a choice made			0
the choice was to carry on into dangerous waters			0
according to the lawsuit it was a decision made purely to save money			0
and it was a decision that very nearly cost the crew of the @entity12 - and her captain - their lives .			1

two pirate attacks and more than 7 warnings went ignored as @entity22 captained the @entity12 deep into the danger zone
claim he *boasted* he ' was n't scared of pirates '
ships told to sail no closer than *680miles* from the @entity16 coast ; the @entity50 was just *270miles* from it when pirates seized it on 8 april 2009
crew members ' galled ' by seeing @entity22 feted a hero in @entity5 and the @entity344
four years after their pirate ordeal a court date has been set
