by @entity0 people are more likely to commit suicide at night than during the day , new research has revealed			1
far more suicides occur between midnight and 4am than during the daytime or evening , the study found			2
the researchers believe this could be because some suicides are trigger by insomnia and by nightmares			1
people are most likely to commit suicide between the hours of midnight and 4am , a new study shows the researchers , at the @entity16 in @entity17 , found the average suicide rate per hour was 10 per cent after midnight , peaking at 16 per cent between 2am and 2.59am			1
in contrast , the average suicide rate per hour was two per cent between 6am and 11.59pm			0
when six - hour time blocks were examined , the observed frequency of suicide between midnight and 5.59am was 3.6 times higher than expected			2
â€˜ these results suggest that not only are nightmares and insomnia significant risk factors for suicidal [ thoughts ] and behaviour , but just being awake at night may itself be a risk factor for suicide , ' said principal investigator dr @entity30 at the @entity16			1
according to the authors , previous research suggesting that more suicides occur during the day failed to account for the proportion of the population that is awake at each given hour - something that was taken into account for this study			2
it is thought insomnia and nightmares could play a role in prompting suicides at night the current study involved archival analyses of both the @entity46 , which provided data for the estimated time of fatal injury , and the @entity50 , which provided an hourly proportion of the @entity53 population that is awake			1
a total of 35,332 suicides were included in the analysis			0
according to dr @entity30 , an important implication of the study is that the treatment of insomnia may be one way to reduce suicide risk			0
the @entity64 reports that about 10 per cent of adults have a chronic insomnia disorder lasting at least three months			0
accounting for more than 38,000 deaths each year , suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the @entity53 according to the @entity72			0
in comparison , about 16,000 deaths occur each year due to homicide .			0

the most common time to commit suicide is between midnight and 4am
suicide rates peak between 2am and *3am* and are lowest during the day
aside from insomnia and nightmares prompting some suicides , simply being awake at night may be a risk factor , say @entity53 researchers
