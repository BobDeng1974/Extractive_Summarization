by @entity0 published : 16:19 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 08:19 est , 3 october 2013 women inspired by @entity2 are demanding breast removal surgery – even if they do n’t need it - a leading doctor has warned			1
after @entity5 , 38 , who is in a high - risk cancer category , announced this year she had had a double mastectomy , a surge of women in the @entity10 have sought to follow suit			1
a quarter of women who develop cancer in one breast are now asking for both to be removed , according to figures from the @entity17			0
but professor @entity18 of the @entity17 has said surgery would be pointless for women who are not in the same category as @entity2			2
popular : @entity2 's decision to have both breasts removed and surgically re-enhanced has prompted many women to get tested and ask for the procedure , according to professor @entity26 ( right ) dr @entity18 said : ‘ it ’s obviously a great step forward that @entity2 has increased awareness of breast cancer			1
‘ but we ’re seeing a large number of women requesting a preventative mastectomy for peace of mind , women who ’ve been diagnosed but do n’t have a genetic predisposition so would n’t benefit			0
‘ these are patients who say , “ can you do for me what @entity2 had done ? ” they ’re on the increase			0
‘ doctors and patients need to avoid overestimating the benefits			0
’ as a carrier of the mutation in the @entity52 gene @entity5 ’s risk of developing breast cancer was increased by more than 80 per cent , and ovarian cancer by 50 per cent			1
surge : double mastectomies have quadrupled as patients ask their doctors for ' what @entity2 had ' preventative : @entity60 singer @entity59 had the procedure when she was diagnosed with breast cancer studies show that the occurrence of breast cancer may be reduced by 90 per cent or more after preventive mastectomy in women with a high risk of this disease			1
miss @entity2 received praise after announcing her decision to have both breasts removed following the deaths of her aunt from breast cancer and her mother from ovarian cancer			1
@entity17 figures showed genetic testing for @entity52 mutations at their clinic had risen by 67 per cent since @entity2 went public , and preventative mastectomies have risen fourfold			1
professor @entity18 said the ‘ fear factor ’ had led some patients to ask for preventative surgery and that there was a danger of over-treatment			1
fewer than one per cent of women carry the faulty @entity52 gene - like @entity5 - or @entity93 gene , which is very similar			2
professor @entity18 warned patients can suffer psychological harm after having radical surgery			0
too much ? experts are now warning there is a danger of ' over treatment ' as many women do n't need it publicity : the cause to fight breast cancer is now well publicised but experts are calling for sensible treatment he urged women to have counselling and proper screening before they consider preventative breast removal			1
the cost of a test for @entity52 or @entity93 mutations is £ 1,500			0
not all @entity117 hospitals offer it because of the expense			0
the procedure involves the removal of both breasts and provides the greatest protection for women at high risk of developing cancer in breast tissue			2
breast reconstruction can be done at the time of the preventive mastectomy			0
when this happens it is called an immediate reconstruction			0
women with a family history of breast cancer are advised to undergo genetic screening which is done via a blood test			2
they can also take drugs to lessen the risk including @entity141 which works by suppressing oestrogen , a hormone that triggers tumour growth , or by undergoing very regular checks			0
as part of @entity148 45 - year - old singer @entity59 revealed she had also chosen to have a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with cancer for the second time .			2

tests for high - risk cancer gene have risen by 67 **%** since @entity2 's operation
*actress* carries the @entity52 mutation giving her 80 **%** chance of breast cancer
she had preventative surgery and went public with the news in may this year
double mastectomies in the @entity10 have quadrupled since then
experts warn there is a danger of ' over treatment ' as many ' do n't need it '
