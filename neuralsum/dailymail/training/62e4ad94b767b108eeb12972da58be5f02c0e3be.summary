@entity2 bomber @entity1 was so close to death after being shot multiple times by authorities that he had to have immediate life - saving surgery once arriving at the hospital , new court documents reveal			1
his lawyers said he had gunshot wounds to his head , face , throat , jaw , left hand and legs after the shoot out that occurred when he was found hiding in a boat in @entity19 , @entity20			1
@entity1 's health ' suddenly declined ' immediately after he was transported to a local hospital and doctors were forced to perform emergency surgery to keep him alive			1
@entity1 is accused of working with his now - dead brother to place two bombs near the finish line of the 2013 marathon , killing three people and injured more than 260			2
his trial is scheduled for november he was intubated throughout the night and given heavy pain medication like @entity32 , @entity33 , and @entity34 which was one of the prescription drugs that @entity37 overdosed on when he died			1
just 20 hours after being brought to the hospital , he was questioned by investigators in a session that lasted for about 36 hours in spite of his repeated requests for a lawyer and rest			1
his left eye was sutured closed , had a tracheotomy tube down his throat , could n't hear out of his left ear , and his mouth was wired shut throughout the interrogation			1
his legal team submitted the new documents to the court in an effort to suppress the statements he made - using a notepad because of his inability to speak - during the questioning session			2
rights denied : @entity1 's lawyers argued that he wrote notes asking for a lawyer at least 10 times during his questioning immediately after coming out of surgery defense attorneys said the questioning continued ' despite the fact that he quickly allayed concerns about any continuing threat to public safety , repeatedly asked for a lawyer , and begged to rest			1
' ' the questioning continued for hours , in what was obviously an effort to extract as much incriminating information as possible , without regard for the protections of the @entity78 , ' the filing states			0
they said his treatment included painkillers that impaired his judgment and increased his susceptibility to pressure			0
documents reveal that he complained about his pain and said that he needed to vomit			2
' mr. @entity1 wrote answers to questions in a notebook because he was unable to speak , ' his defense team wrote in the motion filed wednesday			1
' these notes reflect his attempt to respond to urgent questions ( he assured the agents that no public safety threat remained ) as well as his poor functioning and limited cognitive ability			0
' in all , he wrote the word ‘ lawyer ’ ten times , sometimes circling it			2
' one of the agents insisted , nonsensically , that mr. @entity1 was not in custody			2
' there are instances where the pen trailed off the page , and his legal team is arguing that it is a sign of him passing out or losing control of his motor function during the interrogation			1
at one point , @entity1 's note implies that the questioning agents lied to him about his brother , @entity119 , who had been killed in a shootout days earlier			2
in one note , @entity1 wrote : ' is my brother alive i know you said he is are you lying is he alive ? ' ' these questions went well beyond even the @entity127 's own written policy regarding use of the public safety exception to interrogate members of terrorist organizations , ' his legal team wrote			2
the lawyers said his rights also were violated when his appearance in court was delayed to complete the interrogation , during which he told authorities about how the bombs were built and about the brothers ' activities before and after the bombing			0
' agents made clear by word and deed that they would not allow him to see a lawyer until they had finished questioning him , ' his defense team 's filing said			1
according to @entity152 , the prosecution has implied that they will not be using any of the bedside statements in the trial , but they have not formally noted that in court documents , so yesterday 's filing is seeking a notarized version of that agreement			0
also on wednesday , the defense asked the judge to declare the federal death penalty unconstitutional			0
security concerns : the @entity163 argues that they were able to question @entity1 without a lawyer present because they needed answers immediately about whether or not there were any more bombs or threats to public safety after he was caught they cited ' worldwide revulsion over the recurring spectacle of botched executions , ' including one in @entity174 last month when the inmate was straining to lift his head off a pillow after supposedly being rendered unconscious			1
@entity1 's lawyers said the @entity181 @entity180 's protection against cruel and unusual punishment prohibits the application of the death penalty because it 's not authorized under @entity20 law			0
mind games : @entity1 's notes also implies that the interrogators told him that his brother @entity119 ( pictured ) was alive even though he had died during an earlier shoot out the lawyers also asked the judge to bar federal prosecutors from arguing that targeting the crowded athletic event last year is a factor a jury should consider when weighing his possible punishment if he 's convicted			1
the lawyers said the decision to bomb the marathon should n't be an ' aggravating factor ' in determining whether he should receive the death penalty because prosecutors also argue he committed the offense after substantial planning to cause death and commit an act of terrorism			0
' stated differently , the allegation that @entity1 targeted the marathon is simply a more specific statement of the substantial planning allegation , ' @entity1 's lawyers wrote in a court filing			0
federal law requires the jury to reach its sentencing decision by weighing each aggravating factor cited by prosecutors against mitigating factors cited by the defense			0
@entity1 's lawyers said having duplicative aggravating factors ' can have no other effect than to introduce arbitrariness and unfairness into the jury 's sentencing deliberations			0
' @entity1 , 20 , has pleaded not guilty to several federal charges			0
prosecutors allege he and his brother , 26 , planted two pressure cooker bombs near the marathon 's finish line , killing three people and injuring more than 260 .			0
