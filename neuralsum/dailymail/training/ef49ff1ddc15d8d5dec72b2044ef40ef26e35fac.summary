@entity8 ’s first - team squad , currently top of the @entity10 , favourites for the title and still on course for an historic quadruple , is comprised of a group where almost four in five have played for their countries this year			2
and those who have n’t , like captain @entity16 , are recent full internationals or current age - group internationals			2
@entity0 , with the likes of @entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 , have the highest calibre team in world football when measured in terms of the number of stars who have made full international appearances in 2014 @entity0 ’s ‘ active internationals ’ percentage of players is 78.3 per cent , according to new figures published in a ‘ digital atlas ’ by expert analysts from the @entity31 in @entity32			1

the ‘ active ’ element of the measurement is key because it indicates that the players concerned are at the top of their game , being picked for their countries , not retired , and not merely ‘ up and coming			0
’ @entity70 ’s ratio of full active internationals is so relatively low because @entity84 has been forced - or has chosen - to use so many young players this campaign , uncapped as yet by their countries at senior level			1

within the @entity10 , @entity0 are clear of @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity75 , @entity74 and @entity70 and then a surprise contender fills eighth place in @entity61 - @entity117 , where half the current squad have won full caps this year			1
@entity121 ’s multi-national team is next then @entity122			0
