by @entity0 published : 09:57 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 19:31 est , 1 october 2013 chart hits are increasingly glamorising alcohol and could be driving children to drink , researchers have warned			0
almost one in five songs in modern top tens contains a reference to booze – twice as many as ten years ago and almost three times as many as 30 years ago			1
the study also found that today ’s music is more likely to glorify drinking than songs of the previous decade			1
recent number ones referring to alcohol include @entity18 ’s cheers and @entity20 ’s @entity19			2
since 2001 , lyrics about alcohol have more than doubled , according to @entity24 's @entity23			1
researchers fear it glamourises drinking to children			0
one in five songs in the @entity31 charts was found to make references to alcohol , while children and teens were found to spend two hours a day listening to these songs with former studies showing that exposure to alcohol marketing raises the odds that under - 16s will start to drink , the researchers described their findings as a ‘ major concern ’			1
the research team at @entity24 @entity46 counted mentions of alcohol in songs that reached the @entity31 top ten in 1981 , 1991 , 2001 and 2011			1
songs that specifically mentioned drunkenness were also noted			0
the proportion of hits featuring alcohol rose from 5.8 per cent in 1981 to 18.5 per cent in 2011			0
and by 2011 , one in eight songs referred to heavy drinking			2
the number of references was lowest in 1991 , at 2.1 per cent			2
the researchers say this could be due to the rise of rave culture – linked more to the drug @entity63 than alcohol			0
by the bottle : @entity18 tweeted this photo of herself a selection of lyrics from popular songs that glorify drinking the study attributes the rise of alcohol - related lyrics to an increase in the amount of @entity77 songs becoming popular in the @entity31			1
it uses @entity79 's last friday night , a still from the music video pictured , as an example and claims the song links drinking to confidence and success the analysis , published in the @entity86 , found mentions of drink to be most common in tracks from the @entity77 and in r&b , rap and hip - hop genres			1
by 2011 , the proportion of songs that glamorised alcohol by linking it to confidence , sociability or good looks clearly outweighed those that blamed it for hangovers and health problems			2
similar studies have been done in the @entity77 but this is the first to look at @entity31 charts			2
researcher professor @entity106 said that the hidden advertising could encourage youngsters to start drinking or lead those who already drink to consume more			0
she said parents should be aware of the content of songs their children listen to			0
the study looked into chart history			0
songs in 1981 contained relatively few references to alcohol , with the number declining further in 1991			1
yet by 2001 they featured in 8 % of hits			0
this figure continued to climb , more than doubling by 2011 18.5 per cent of the top 10 songs featuring alcohol - related lyrics professor @entity106 added that although lyrics can not be censored , it may be possible to warn about references to alcohol on labels that point out sexually explicit and violent lyrics			1
the research concluded : ‘ @entity133 and other professionals should recognise increased alcohol promotion in popular music and ensure this does not reinforce the binge drinking culture or contribute to the already high burdens of alcohol on young people			0
’ earlier this week it emerged that 6,580 youngsters aged 18 or under were admitted to hospital with alcohol - related problems – some younger than 11			1
@entity147 , of @entity148 , said young people ‘ over-estimate how much their peers drink ’ because advertising for it is ‘ simply everywhere ’ .			0

one in five songs in the @entity31 top ten found to contain references to alcohol
since 2001 , the number of alcohol - related lyrics has more than doubled
*experts* warn *pro-drinking* lyrics are a threat to youngsters and fans
study claims songs glamourise drinking and *ignore* the potential risks
