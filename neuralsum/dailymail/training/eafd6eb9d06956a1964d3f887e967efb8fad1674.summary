by @entity0 @entity1 has hailed the talents of @entity3 ahead of @entity5 's clash with @entity6 in @entity7			1
the @entity9 boss is in the market for a new striker after the proposed Â£ 8.5million deal to sign @entity14 ' @entity13 collapsed due to a failed medical			1
and @entity1 says he 's a fan of the controversial @entity16 international , who has been heavily linked with a return to the @entity20 this summer			1
' i saw that in this time at @entity29 as a young player and obviously going to @entity31 when we had a real close eye on him there			2
' he 's got all the qualities			0
he 's 6ft 3ins , he 's quick , his touch is terrific and he can score goals			0
' he went back to @entity16 to play and he 's still so young			2
if his focus is right , his concentration is right and he leads the lifestyle of a top player then he can play for any team in the world			2
' @entity5 face @entity6 at @entity44 's @entity43 on saturday night knowing victory will secure their place in monday 's final of the @entity48 in @entity49			1
@entity50 time : @entity3 has ' all the qualities ' , according to the @entity5 boss @entity1 ' side have already beaten @entity54 and @entity31 in the tournament and one major plus has been the form of defender @entity58			1
the @entity60 centre - back missed most of last season with a serious knee injury but is now back to full fitness and has impressed in the @entity64			0
' @entity65 is a player who played in the team when i first came into the club and then was out of the team , ' @entity1 said			1
' he was very unfortunate to have had a bad injury which put him out for a while , but he went away on loan , got himself fit and he 's come back and done really well in pre-season			2
' he 's a real good guy as well , a humble man , never cries about not playing and accepts as a professional he wo n't play in every game on the way back : @entity1 says @entity58 could have a future at the club technique : the boss said @entity58 is excellent on the deck considering his height ' he 's a big boy but he can play football			1
he has a lovely touch , lovely technique but he can pass the ball and he can be aggressive			0
' the question is whether he gets enough games that will satisfy his own personal needs because he 's a talent			2
' he 's done well in the games and we 'll see what the rest of the summer holds for him			0
' as well as searching for more firepower , @entity5 are working on deals to sign @entity96 left - back @entity95 and @entity98 right - back @entity97			1
however , @entity1 would n't be drawn on the club 's transfer activity			1
' we wo n't have too much business to be done but we still have a few areas we want to strengthen , ' he said			2
private : @entity1 would n't be drawn on moves for @entity95 ( above ) and @entity97 ( below ) ' it 's just purely on the back of us having a really thin squad last season , we were very short and it was incredible what we achieved last year			1
' we need to make sure we have the freshness so there 's still one or two areas to look at			0
' there is no point mentioning numbers or positions , we want to strengthen a couple of positions and if we can do that i 'll be really happy			0
' this trip has been a great chance to come away , improve fitness levels and reintroduce some of the tactics into the team			0
' the new players have settled in quickly			0
that 's a great credit not just to just them but to the team			0
there 's no egos here and the spirit in the team is very strong .			0

@entity1 says @entity3 is a ' big talent ' but is n't drawn on transfers
