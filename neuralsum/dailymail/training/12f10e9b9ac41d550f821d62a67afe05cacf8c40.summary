sgt. @entity0 converted to @entity1 during his captivity , declaring himself a ' mujahid ' , or warrior for the faith according to once - secret documents revealed today			1
@entity0 , who was taken prisoner by the @entity8 in 2009 after being found wandering a road alone and cursing @entity10 , became accepted by his captors to the point where he was allowed to fire an @entity13 during target practice , played soccer with them and was permitted to carry his own firearm			1
psychologists who spoke to @entity19 ' @entity18 about the purported eyewitness accounts of @entity0 's imprisonment said the documents illustrated a possible case of @entity23 - the condition which causes hostages to sympathize or even join the cause of their captors in order to survive			2
however , the documents reveal that @entity0 , who was returned to @entity10 custody during a pow exchange over the weekend , endured a checkered relationship with his @entity8 captors			1
at other times during his five - years of internment with his @entity48 captors , @entity0 conversed in friendly terms with them and would frequently use the word ' salaam ' , which is the @entity52 word for peace			2
this information was obtained by and seen by @entity19 provided by the secretive @entity55			0
it is a top - secret private firm of former intelligence operatives subcontracted by the @entity58 to obtain ground reports from every corner of the globe			2
using a source within the 200 or so @entity8 captors who kept @entity0 , the former spies compiled reports for the @entity66 , or @entity66 , which is headquartered at @entity67 in @entity68 , from november 2009 , to may 31 , 2010			1
@entity55 is operated by @entity69 , who used to be a senior operations officer for the @entity71 in the 1980s			0
however , he is best remembered for being indicted for lying to @entity72 about his role in the @entity75			0
he was pardoned by president @entity76 in december 1992 , during his trial			0
using his groups assets , @entity69 compiled 13 situation reports or @entity80 , which were sent to @entity81			0
gen. @entity82 - who in april 2010 was named the director of intelligence at the j - 2 level at @entity66			0
despite the initial contract expiring in 2010 , according to @entity19 , @entity69 used $ 50,000 of his own money to continue the providing the reports			0
relief : no specifics about @entity92 's medical condition have been publicly released but a spokesman said today that he is getting better on a daily basis it was @entity96 # 3023 , dated august 23 , 2012 , that provided information from @entity99 's @entity48 sources , which makes the claim that that @entity0 had declared himself a ' mujahid '			1
this was allegedly provided to @entity81			0
gen. @entity103 , who is now commanding general at the @entity105 and @entity106			0
calls to that base about what was known about @entity0 were not returned			2
the documents seen by @entity19 date from october 2009 , which is around three - months after @entity0 walked away from his base in @entity114 to august 2012			1
they paint a picture of a turbulent period in captivity - which included bouts inside a metal cage after his failed june 2010 escape			1
other reports reveal that @entity0 would play soccer with his @entity8 captors and was granted the use of an @entity13 for target practice			1
@entity0 was also allowed to carry his own firearm during certain times of his imprisonment			1
@entity130 gen. @entity131 , who was @entity66 commander from august 2010 to august 2012 told @entity19 he knew of some intelligence from @entity55 , but there was never any intelligence to suggest @entity0 was a collaborator			2
@entity96 # 3023 was compiled using a source close to @entity138 , the @entity48 commander charged over the past five years with the care of @entity0			0
@entity55 admit in the report that he was not 100 percent trusted by the group but ' does have plausible access to the information reported and claims to have seen @entity0 personally in @entity144 ' - which is in @entity145			0
waiting for a call : @entity0 has been in @entity10 custody for five days but has not yet called his parents @entity148 and @entity82 , seen with president @entity39 during the announcement of @entity0 's release in a prior report , seen by @entity19 , it outlines how @entity0 and his captors changed their behavior after his june 2010 escape attempt			1
' conditions for @entity0 have greatly relaxed since the time of the escape			0
@entity0 has converted to @entity1 and now describes himself as a mujahid , ' cites the report			1
' @entity0 enjoys a modicum of freedom , and engages in target practice with the local mujahedeen , firing @entity165			0
' @entity0 is even allowed to carry a loaded gun on occasion			2
@entity0 plays soccer with his guards and bounds around the pitch like a mad man			2
' he appears to be well and happy , and has a noticeable habit of laughing frequently and saying ' salaam ' repeatedly			0
' the top secret files were released to @entity19 by @entity175 , who had his agents ' reports described by the @entity179 in 2011 as , ' an amalgam of fact , rumor , analysis and uncorroborated reports ' he released them to demonstrate , ' we know what we 're talking about '			1
this information comes as a @entity8 commander told @entity190 that when @entity0 was picked up , ' our people at the time could n’t understand his language , but it was after he was shifted to a safe location , he said he was n’t happy with his countrymen , but he did n’t intend to convert to @entity1 or join mujahideen ( holy warriors ) '			1
this revelation comes as @entity10 government officials reported that @entity0 's medical condition is ' stable and improving daily '			1
even though he has been in @entity10 custody for five days and remains in treatment at a hospital in @entity204 , he has still not spoken with his parents - even though he has been able to communicate with others			1
' he is conversing with medical staff and becoming more engaged in his treatment plan			0
he is resting better , ' @entity58 spokesman colonel @entity209 said thursday			0
@entity210 reports that @entity0 's father @entity211 sent a video message to his son earlier this week and recorded a portion of the tape in @entity216 , the language of his son 's captors			2
that would have been mr @entity0 's first communication with his son in five years and there is no way he would have known anything about his son 's linguistic abilities			0
waiting : though they have still not spoken with their son , @entity211 , seen here on sunday , apparently sent a taped video message to @entity0 and @entity82 recorded a portion of it in @entity216 @entity233 reported this evening that @entity0 is speaking in @entity234 while in the @entity10 military hospital in @entity204			1
the spokesman would not elaborate on the timetable for his transition from the @entity10 military hospital in @entity204 to the mainland @entity10			1
he is believed to be in the second part of the three - part transition process that will end with him reuniting with his parents - likely in a military hospital in @entity245 , @entity246			1
the 28 - year - old @entity248 native is meeting with psychologists on a daily basis to help him ' regain control of his emotions '			0
@entity0 was initially found by @entity254 civilians , but word traveled to the local @entity257 ban leaders who went to collect the strange @entity10			2
apparently the group first thought it was a staged subterfuge tactic , with the idea being that @entity0 intended to be picked up so that he could spy on the @entity8			1
' as we never saw their soldier patrolling alone ... we would ask him how he managed to walk out of his base ... he would tell us that it was personal issue , ' the unidentified commander told @entity190			0
the circumstances surrounding @entity0 's alleged desertion in 2009 are currently the subject of a federal investigation , but president @entity39 reiterated today during a press conference in @entity272 that he will ' make no apologies ' for arranging the prisoner swap with the @entity8 in order to secure his release			1
when the exchange was first announced over the weekend , the administration said that @entity0 's declining health was a cause for concern , but the video released by the @entity8 showing the hand - off appear to show @entity0 in relatively good health			2
today the administration added that it was not only his health that prompted the deal to be made but also an alleged imminent threat to his life			0
no further details about that alleged threat have been released .			0
