the rooms are filthy , there 's no hot water and the guests are encouraged to dry themselves off with the curtains to save on washing			1
but customers of the @entity7 in @entity8 can never say they were n't warned			1
to prevent complaints , the owners of the $ 22.50 ( £ 18 ) - a-night hotel feel it is best to tell people in advance about what to expect , even if that means a potentially fatal disease or mental illness			1
uninviting : the owners of the @entity7 in @entity8 are happy to admit it is probably the worst hotel around @entity21 : the rooms at @entity7 are , by the owner 's admission , filthy and there 's no hot water brutal honesty : one of the hotel 's adverts ensures the customers are in no doubt what to expect a lengthy disclaimer on their website reads : ' those wishing to stay at the @entity37 , @entity8 , do so at their own risk and will not hold the hotel liable for food poisoning , mental breakdowns , terminal illness , lost limbs , radiation poisoning , certain diseases associated with the 18th century , plague , etc. ' from grotty rooms without a view to dirty bathrooms with no hot water , the owners are happy to admit it is probably the worst hotel around			1
the lift is broken so signs point guests towards the ' eco-friendly elevator ' - or stairs - and by not providing hot water they claim ' it keeps water consumption moderate			1
' they even encourage those who want to shower to dry off using the curtains to save on washing and in turn ' save the planet '			1
hoping you have a life - changing stay : a disclaimer on the hotel 's website warns of the dangers of contracting a potentially fatal disease infectious : despite the self - damning promotional material , the hotel seems to be a hit with travellers from all over the world who are scrambling to book one of the 127 rooms at the hotel life of luxury : fortunately most of the target clientele , made up of students and backpackers , seem to appreciate the honest charm the @entity90 offers introducing the ' eco-towel ' : customers are encouraged to dry themselves off with the curtains advertising slogans include ' it ca n't get any worse			1
but we 'll do our best ' as well as ' improve your immune system - stay at @entity90 ! ' or the modest claim ' now with beds in every room			1
' but this hilariously honest approach seems to be a hit with travellers from all over the world - who are scrambling to book one of the 127 rooms at the hotel			1
