most @entity2 adults are convinced the world is getting worse because our happiest recollections are formed between the ages of 15 and 25 , a new study has revealed			1
despite longer life expectancy , improved living conditions and better technology , 70 per cent of @entity10 believe the world is decline , with a further 55 per cent of people saying that their own lives are getting worse			1
however , psychologists say that people 's minds could be playing tricks on them by making them focus on current global dilemmas such as terrorism , war and negative events in their personal lives			1
psychologists say that as our happiest and strongest recollections are formed between the ages of 15 and 25 , it distorts people 's view of the present day ( file picture ) they add this is due to a ' memory bump ' as our strongest recollections are between the ages of 15 and 25 , which distorts out view of the present			1
the survey was carried out for the @entity38 series , @entity39 , which reports that by only remembering good things from the past , people fear that the future can only get worse			1
professor @entity43 from @entity44 , who features on the new series , says many people look at the past through rose - tinted glasses			0
he explained : ' the idea that everything is getting worse - declinism - is an old one , even ancient @entity52 saw itself as having declined from a former , mythical golden age			0
' in particular our memory tends to forget about the bad events in our past and we have a tendency to rehearse and dwell on the good things that happened in the past			0
the new study for the @entity39 series on @entity38 revealed 70 per cent of @entity10 believe the world is decline ( file picture ) ' we retell them a lot more often , so we reinforce the good memories			1
' we tend to remember the great songs or cars or football players from the " old days " and forget all the bad ones			0
' as part of the survey , researchers carried out an experiment where they asked people to rate their holidays as they experienced them and then again several months later			2
the study found that all the ratings were higher when the travellers recollected their experiences compared to what they said while on the holiday			0
professor @entity43 , who is also an advisor on behavioural change for the government , added : ' the key point is that people rate past holidays - and other experiences - as much more positive in retrospect than they do at the time			0
' this is an illustration of the general idea that my life now does n't seem as good as it will look in retrospect			0
' this leads to status quo bias , which asserts that whatever the situation is now , things in the future will get worse			2
' this plus loss aversion , combined with our memory 's tendency to filter out bad experiences from the past , can leave us seeing the world , and our lives , as getting worse			2

new survey reveals 70 per cent of @entity10 believe that the world is in decline
a further 55 per cent of @entity2 people say that their own lives are worse
but psychologists say this is due to people 's minds playing tricks on them
they add a person 's strongest memories are formed between 15 and 25
they claim this distorts a person 's view of the present day and makes them fear the future
