a breakthrough in technology could see breathalysers being used at football and rugby matches to stop sportsmen and women from playing on with head injuries			1
scientists at the @entity9 claim to have developed a quick breath test that can detect signs of concussion			1
until now , it requires players to have a full medical assessment or brain scan to accurately assess whether someone had concussion			1
@entity19 keeper @entity18 remained on the pitch last season after being knocked out for almost a minute the @entity22 launched the concussion campaign in september 2013 and has already had a strong impact but dr @entity25 and professor @entity26 , from the @entity9 , are developing a breath test which they hope will vastly reduce the number of severe head injuries			1
their discovery has been shown to work in the laboratory and is to undergo wider tests on athletes			2
dr @entity25 said : ‘ it is really important that we protect players from themselves			1
‘ we are talking about someone with mild brain injury when we are looking at concussion			1
they are not in a position to decide whether they are fit to play			0
’ the scientists have discovered three chemicals which are released into the bloodstream when the brain receives an injury			1
the molecules make their way into the lungs and a trace can be detected in the breath			0
it 's been a long time coming but @entity58 sports associations are finally taking the issue of concussion seriously sporting bodies are under pressure to deal with the problem after several high - profile cases			1
last year an inquest heard that @entity66 died after twice suffering head injuries during a school rugby match in 2011			1
the 14 - year - old collapsed on the pitch at @entity71 in @entity72 and died in hospital			0
the @entity74 is also under pressure to act , after @entity19 goalkeeper @entity18 remained on the pitch last year after being knocked out for almost a minute			0
@entity18 and his then manager @entity77 decided he was fit to continue playing - despite the advice of the team ’s medical staff			2
@entity81 was allowed to play on after concussion in the @entity84 final but does n't remember playing @entity18 said later : ‘ when you are on the pitch you do n’t want to leave the pitch , you want to stay with your team - mates and help them get the best result			1
’ another , tragic , example is former @entity93 and @entity94 striker @entity92 , who died at the age of 59 with severe brain damage			2
@entity92 ’s inquest found that his neurological disorder was caused by the repeated impact of heading footballs , which had caused a problem usually only seen in professional boxers			0
the @entity103 recently trialled a pitch side concussion assessment comprised of psychological questions to see whether players are fit to carry on			1
dr @entity25 added : ‘ if you send them back on to the pitch you are potentially putting them at risk			0
that test is not good enough to make that decision			0
’ the scientists have discovered three chemicals which are released into the blood stream when the brain receives an injury			2
the molecules make their way into the lungs and a trace can be detected in the breath			0
professor @entity26 said : ‘ the chemicals are released within minutes			0
’ the scientists have also developed a secondary test which uses a portable machine that sends magnetic pulses into the brain to assess brain damage			2
schoolboy @entity66 ( left ) tragically died after twice suffering head injuries during a school rugby match at @entity71 in @entity72 in 2011 , while striker @entity92 ( right ) died aged 59 with severe brain damage the machine , which uses technology called trans - cranial magnetic stimulation , could be kept in treatment rooms at sports venues to give a better assessment of problems if the breath test highlights any problems			1
@entity92 ’s daughter @entity146 , 46 , is calling for the @entity74 to support further research into the impact of footballing head injuries			1
she told the @entity149 in @entity150 : ‘ if players today had seen my dad in the four years he was ill , if they had seen him die , they would never head a ball again			2
it is a matter of life and death , it really is			0
’ last month , a group of parents in the @entity159 filed a lawsuit against @entity161 which pushes for rule changes around the return to play following a concussion			0
they have also called for limits on how many times children under 17 can head the ball			0
dr @entity25 said : ‘ children ’s brains are not fully formed , they are not as well protected as an adult and we do not fully understand the damage these repeated blows to the head are doing to these children ’s brains			0
‘ may be the day will come when we do need an outright ban on heading balls for children of a certain age			0
’ since the @entity183 ( @entity184 ) or @entity185 ( @entity186 ) was introduced the number of players continuing on with later - diagnosed concussion has fallen from 56 per cent to 12 per cent .			2

@entity191 could be used at sports matches thanks to new technology
aims to prevent sportsmen and women from playing on with head injuries
until now , ' full assessment or brain scan needed to diagnose concussion '
discovery was made by two scientists from the @entity9
@entity207 have committed to *clamping* down on teams who fail to protect players
