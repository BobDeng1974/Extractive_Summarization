by @entity0 published : 08:03 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 09:08 est , 30 april 2012 accused : former @entity2 chief @entity1 , seen voting in the first round of the 2012 @entity5 presidential elections , told magistrates swinging parties were about having free and consensual sex former @entity2 chief @entity1 has claimed it is ' normal ' for him to have sex with six different women at orgies			1
the 63 - year - old economist , accused of knowingly using vice girls in an alleged prostitution ring , also told magistrates his young conquests were not call girls and that he often had sex with women in their 20s			1
the man once tipped as the next @entity5 president , gave the extraordinary explanation to magistrates probing claims he used £ 800 - a - night prostitutes at swingers ' parties			2
he has been charged with conspiring with pimps and of knowing fraudulently obtained money was being paid to the vice girls by the racket based in @entity34 , northern @entity5			1
in a hearing from march , the transcript of which has only been published today , a magistrate asks mr @entity39 : ' bearing in mind the high number of girls , their age and their behaviour , do you maintain you did not know they were prostitutes ? ' ' i counted that there were six girls in total , ' mr @entity39 replied			2
' that does not seem to me to be a considerable number			0
' the magistrate went on : ' do think that if they had not been paid , they would not have agreed to have sex with you on so many occasions , considering the age difference between you ? ' mr @entity1 answered : ' numerous young women with whom i 've had sexual exchanges - no , that 's the wrong word - sexual relations , had the same age difference			1
' the world 's former top banker went on to explain : ' swinging parties are about having free and consensual sex			0
think what you like about it on a moral level , but no one was being paid			0
' the 62 - year - old has openly confessed to attending swingers parties in @entity5 and @entity77 , but said he never knew the girls were prostitutes because ' they were all naked at the time '			1
his lawyer , @entity79 , said : ' at these parties , people were not dressed , and i defy you to tell the difference between a naked prostitute and any other naked woman			2
' but mr @entity1 's claims come after five @entity5 and @entity77 vice girls told police they were paid to have sex with the former bank chief			1
one girl told detectives she attended 11 orgies with him over six years and added in her statement : ' i got the feeling he liked rough sex			0
' coming out of the woodwork : five @entity5 and @entity77 vice girls have told police they were paid to have sex with the former bank chief , seen here with his wife @entity103 during a bail hearing in @entity105 last year scandal : last year mr @entity39 was charged with raping a maid at the @entity108 in @entity105			1
the charges were later dropped another prostitute named @entity111 , 30 , also told investigators it was ' rare to find men who showed as little respect for girls ' as mr @entity39			2
she added : ' it was just pure sexual consumption , and these sessions often became bestial and violent			2
' mr @entity1 has been embroiled in a catalogue of sex scandals since he was accused of raping a hotel chambermaid in an upmarket @entity105 hotel in may last year			2
after being held in @entity105 's notorious @entity126 's @entity125 prison , criminal charges were dropped and he returned to @entity5 only to face similar accusations of sexually abusing a young @entity5 writer			0
when those allegations were also dropped , he was then confronted with more claims he used prostitutes supplied by the @entity34 vice network			0
police also uncovered texts sent between mr @entity1 and men accused of hiring prostitutes for him , in which the economist referred to girls as ' equipment ' and ' bits of stuff ' as he arranged sex sessions around the world			1
his lawyer @entity144 has described him as a ' simple swinger ' who committed nothing more than a ' crime of lust '			1
mr @entity144 said he and his client would now do everything in their power to have the charges brought by two judges in @entity34 dismissed			0
he said : ' it is quite implausible and contrary to common sense to use terms like " organised gang " and " vice network " to describe a simple swinging activity			0
' mr @entity1 is finding himself , in large part because of his fame , thrown to the wolves			0
and what a strange coincidence that all this should happen a month from a major national election			0
' coincidence ? mr @entity39 's lawyer @entity144 , said it was a ' strange coincidence ' that his client should be going through the case a month from a major national election now between @entity172 ( pictured ) and @entity173 mr @entity1 had been widely tipped to stand as the socialist candidate in this month 's presidential election , with polls showing he would easily have beaten right - wing rival @entity172			1
this week he accused @entity179 's @entity178 newspaper of fabricating an ' interview ' in which he is quoted as saying @entity172 conspired to wreck his bid for the presidency			0
while a furious @entity172 threatened to sue , mr @entity1 said the interview was simply a ' montage ' of old quotes			0
mr @entity1 is now formally under ' judicial control ' on £ 85,000 bail until judges decide whether to send him to stand trial , which means he can not leave @entity5 and has to report to police regularly .			1

@entity39 charged with conspiring with pimps and knowing fraudulently obtained money used to pay vice girls
claims he did not know women were vice girls ' because they were naked all the time '
five @entity5 and @entity77 vice girls tell police @entity1 did pay them for sex

but lawyer says @entity1 is ' simple swinger ' who committed nothing more than ' crime of lust '
