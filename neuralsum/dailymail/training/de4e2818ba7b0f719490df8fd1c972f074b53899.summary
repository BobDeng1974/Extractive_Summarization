by @entity0 actress @entity1 , who suffered a miscarriage herself in 2010 , and delivered a stillborn son in 2011 , is hosting @entity5 's @entity4 thousands of miscarried and aborted babies have been incinerated by @entity9 hospitals without their mothers ’ knowledge , an investigation has found			1
the government was forced to ban the practice after it emerged that 15,500 foetal remains have been incinerated by 27 trusts over the last two years alone			2
the bodies are being burned as ‘ clinical waste ’ , while at two trusts they were put into ‘ waste - to - energy ’ furnaces which generate power for hospitals			1
one devastated mother who suffered a miscarriage was told her child would be ‘ incinerated with the rest of the day ’s waste ’			1
the scandal of how the @entity9 treats parents who lose a child in early pregnancy was uncovered as part of a @entity5 dispatches programme to be broadcast tonight			1
last night health minister @entity34 stepped in to order an immediate ban on incinerating foetal remains			2
‘ this practice is totally unacceptable , ’ he said			0
‘ that is why i have asked professor sir @entity39 , @entity9 medical director , to write to all @entity9 hospital trusts , to make it clear that it must stop now			0
‘ the chief medical officer has also written to the @entity44 to ask them to make sure that there is clear guidance on this issue			0
‘ while the vast majority of hospitals are acting in the appropriate way , that must be the case for all hospitals and the @entity44 has now been asked to ensure that it acts on this issue without delay			0
’ @entity57 , 35 , found out during a 13 - week pregnancy scan that her baby had died at eight weeks , and later underwent a medical procedure to remove the foetus			0
she said : ‘ i was hysterical			0
i asked one of the nurses what would happen to my baby ; and she just said - well , it will be incinerated with the rest of the day ’s waste			1
‘ that was really difficult to hear because to me it was n’t waste , it was my baby			2
’ the trust involved can not be named for legal reasons			0
the programme reveals that @entity74 ’s in @entity75 incinerated 797 babies below 13 weeks ’ gestation at their own ‘ waste to energy ’ plant			1
@entity5 programme @entity79 : ending @entity4 reveals how @entity81 in @entity75 , pictured , incinerated 797 babies below 13 weeks ' gestation at their own ' waste to energy ' plant forms handed to women at the hospitals say the remains are ‘ cremated ’ - making no mention of ‘ incineration ’			1
it goes against advice from @entity96 , the neonatal death charity , which states that incineration , under which the remains are burned along with the rest of the waste , ‘ must not be called cremation ’			1
another ‘ waste to energy ’ facility at @entity104 has incinerated 1,101 foetal remains between 2011/12 and 2012/13			1
they were brought in from another hospital before being burned , generating energy for the hospital site			2
@entity104 hospital itself uses cremation , and the furnace facility is run by a private company			2
the programme is hosted by actress and @entity118 ’s @entity117 star @entity1 , who suffered a miscarriage herself in 2010 , and delivered a stillborn son in 2011			1
the bodies are being burned as ' clinical waste ' , while at two trusts - including @entity74 's in @entity75 - they were put into ' waste - to - energy ' furnaces which generate power for hospitals she said : ‘ i was shocked at some of the discoveries i made during filming			1
the mothers i spoke to said that despite the best intentions of individual nurses and doctors , they sometimes felt that hospitals were n’t as compassionate as they should be towards them			0
‘ i am absolutely delighted that the government has announced a ban on this practice			0
the change in policy means an end to the misery and prolonged anguish of many parents across @entity146			0
’ the @entity148 watchdog has also said it will investigate the programme ’s findings			2
professor sir @entity151 , chief inspector of hospitals , said : ‘ i am disappointed trusts may not be informing or consulting women and their families			0
this breaches our standard on respecting and involving people who use services			0
‘ we scrutinise information of concern and can inspect unannounced , if required			0
’ a total of one in seven pregnancies ends in a miscarriage , while @entity9 figures show there are around 4,000 stillbirths each year in the @entity118 - or 11 each day			1
a spokesman for the @entity172 trust , which runs @entity74 ’s , said : ‘ trained health professionals discuss the options with the patients and families respectfully and sensitively , both verbally and in writing			1
‘ the parents are given exactly the same choice on the disposal of foetal remains as for a stillborn child , and their personal wishes are respected			0
’ @entity104 trust said it was concerned to discover that foetal remains from another hospital were incinerated on its site			1
