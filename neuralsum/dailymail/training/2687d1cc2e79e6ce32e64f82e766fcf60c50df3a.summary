by @entity0 published : 16:04 est , 2 january 2014 updated : 03:28 est , 3 january 2014 a grandmother has become one of the longest - surviving transplant patients in the country after 40 years living with a donated kidney			1
@entity7 , 70 , underwent a kidney transplant in december 1973 , with the organ expected to last for just five years			1
the retired postal worker has stunned experts by living with the kidney for eight times as long , and is still the picture of good health			1
one of the longest surviving transplant patients in the country , 70 - year - old @entity7 in the 1970s ( left ) and today ( right ) she believes her good fortune is all the more remarkable because she had her transplant on the traditionally unlucky day of friday the 13th			1
she said : ' it is a wonderful feeling to have proved the experts wrong			2
and to be told that i am one of the longest survivors in the @entity24 is a real honour and an accolade i am proud of			2
' i have n't got a theory why the kidney has lasted so long - i do n't have any special food , drink or activity to help things			1
i suppose i 'm just a very , very lucky person			0
' and i still feel in great health , hopefully there 'll be a few more years in the kidney yet			1
' mrs @entity7 , of @entity35 - in - @entity36 , @entity37 , became ill at the age of 25 but was not aware the problem was linked to her kidneys			1
a few years later she was eventually sent to @entity41 in @entity42 where renal failure was diagnosed			2
mrs @entity7 only had days to live before she was put on dialysis while an organ donor was found			1
she said : ' while i was on dialysis i had to be very careful what i ate and drank , i could never go away on holidays - even in @entity49 - and was forced to live a very restricted life			0
mrs @entity7 has lived for four decades and seen the birth of her two grandchildren ' it was tough , for all the family , at times			1
but we supported each other , worked through it and it was never a problem as such			0
' when a compatible organ became available , her husband @entity59 , 69 , a local councillor , was reluctant for her to have it because he feared the risks			2
but mrs @entity7 responded to the operation well , and recovered in hospital for three weeks with family members allowed to visit in special sterile clothes			1
she said : ' people will say to me ' ooh it 's friday the 13th this week you know ' and i 'll smile and say back to them ' i know and i ca n't wait '			0
' it 's most people 's unlucky day but it 's my luckiest day and i look forward to them every time one 's coming up			0
' before the operation i was never allowed to drink coffee			0
and i remember after the operation one of the doctors told me not to drink any of the hospital 's coffee and said he would go out and fetch me a proper one			0
' the taste was divine , i 'll never forget that			0
' eventually , when she was allowed home , the couple were able to lead a normal life , going on family holidays and eating out			0
it meant that she was able to see her son @entity95 , 47 , grow up and get married , and witness the births of @entity97 , 22 , and @entity98 , 20			0
this week , to celebrate her achievement , she held a special party for family and close friends at the on the anniversary of her surgery			0
she added : ' i 'm living proof of how vital organ donation is			1
it really does allow people to live a full and normal life , like we have done			0
i 've been given the gift of life			0
' i 'm hoping my story shows how important the kidney transplant programme is and that people should continue to donate			1
' the @entity115 never discovered the identity of the organ donor , but they believe it may have been a local girl who died in a car accident			2
@entity122 , of @entity123 , said they had no statistics relating to the longest surviving transplant patients but a transplant usually lasted between 10 and 15 years			2
she said : ' more than 6000 people , around 90 per cent of the total organ waiting list , are waiting for a kidney , but less than 3000 transplants are carried out each year			2
