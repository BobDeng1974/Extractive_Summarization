by @entity0 published : 11:35 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 13:48 est , 22 november 2012 a student rugby club has been banned from playing after team members dressed up as paedophile @entity3 and his victims on a night out			1
the bad taste fancy - dress event was organised by members of @entity8 at @entity9			1
@entity10 ’s - one of the university ’s most successful college sides - has been forbidden from playing for the rest of the term after first - year players dressed up as young girls , second years wore @entity18 outfits , and third and fourth years came as police officers or @entity21 journalists			1
scandal : members of @entity8 in @entity23 ( pictured ) have been banned until @entity24 after dressing as @entity3 and his victims on top of the inappropriate theme , it is alleged one person stripped off , another tried to steal a dartboard from a rival college bar and more players set off a fire alarm			1
members have also been barred from at least two college bars			2
a @entity9 spokesman said : ' the university has been made aware of an incident			0
' we take such matters very seriously			0
the students ’ college has investigated the incident and disciplinary action is being taken			0
' it is understood organisers of the event , on october 25 , have been ordered to carry out unpaid work and £ 50 fines have been imposed on players			1
prank : members of the society thought it would be funny to lampoon @entity3 and his hundreds of victims but university bosses have taken a dim view @entity58 celebrates its 125th anniversary next year and counts @entity61 news presenter @entity60 among its alumni			2
a member of the team , who did not want to be named , said he was ‘ disillusioned ’ with the process			0
' playing bans are unprecedented , ' he said			0
' other colleges have had numerous disciplinary hearings , while the university rugby club , @entity70 , have been involved in several serious incidents that have not resulted in playing bans			0
' would @entity70 ever be banned from playing ? absolutely not			2
' the college rugby team has one of the most successful records in @entity23 , winning the men ’s @entity76 five times in the last seven years			1
however , on the @entity76 website , the team has already been dropped to the bottom of the table and a loss of 40 - 0 will be recorded for every game until their ban has ended .			0
