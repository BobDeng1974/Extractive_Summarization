by @entity0 published : 11:53 est , 14 december 2012 updated : 16:27 est , 17 december 2012 the @entity1 and the @entity2 today refused to sign the first @entity4 telecommunications treaty of the internet age , claiming it would lead to greater government control of cyberspace			1
they were among a group of 20 nations which walked away from negotiations in @entity12 after an ideological split over the nature of the @entity5 and who is responsible for its growth and governance			1
rival countries - including @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity22 states - insisted governments should have a greater sway over internet affairs and sought to break the @entity27 grip on information technology			1
the @entity1 and @entity2 today led a bloc of 20 nations which refused to sign the accords they also favoured greater international help to bring reliable online links to the world 's least developed regions			1
in a testament to the contentious atmosphere at the negotiations of the @entity4 's @entity48 , the pages of reservations and comments by various countries involved were longer than the treaty itself			1
in the end , it was supported by 89 countries in the 193 - member union			1
fifty - five did not sign , including the @entity2 - led bloc of more than 20 nations , and others needing home country approval			1
the remainder did not have high - ranking envoys in @entity12			2
the @entity48 - which dates to the age of the telegraph in the mid- 19th century - has no technical powers to change how the @entity5 operates or force countries to follow its non-binding accords , which also dealt with issues such as mobile phone roaming rates and international emergency numbers			1
but the @entity2 and its backers nevertheless worried that the new treaty could alter the tone of debates about the @entity5			1
instead of viewing it as a free - form network , they claim , it could increasingly been seen as a commodity that needs clear lines of oversight			1
@entity33 , the group 's secretary - general , said he was ' very much surprised ' by the @entity2 - led snub after days of difficult negotiations that dropped or softened wording that troubled the @entity85			1
yet it fell short of @entity2 - led demands that all references to the @entity5 - even indirect or couched in general language - be omitted			1
breakdown in communications : mr @entity33 , left , said said he was very much surprised by the snub after days of difficult negotiations had softened or dropped wording that had troubled @entity2 delegate @entity93 , right even apparently clear - cut issues such as unsolicited email ' spam ' brought division			1
efforts to try to address blanket electronic message barrages was seen by @entity2 envoys and others as something governments could use as possible @entity4 cover for increased surveillance on email traffic			1
' fundamental divides were exposed , ' said @entity107 , ceo and president of the @entity109 , an industry group			2
internet restrictions and availability at selected countries and regions around the world : internet use is extremely restricted with many of @entity118 's 24million people unable to get online			1
some @entity118 can access an internal intranet that connects to state media			0
members of the elite , resident foreigners and visitors in certain hotels are allowed full access			0
most @entity27 social media sites such as @entity128 and @entity129 are blocked in @entity19 , as well as political opposition and sexually explicit websites			2
but proxy server sites and other methods are widely used to get around the official restrictions			0
there are more than 500 million @entity20 online but they contend with an extensive internet filtering and censorship system popularly known as the ' @entity138			2
' censors police blogs and domestic social media for content deemed pornographic or politically subversive and delete it			0
tight control , slow connections and high costs mean only around 5 percent of @entity147 have access to the global @entity5 , with another 23 percent relying instead on a government intranet with very limited content			0
web access is mainly via public facilities where people must first register with identification			0
internet censorship is prevalent across former @entity158 @entity157 republics , but the strongest restrictions have been recorded in @entity19 's authoritarian neighbours to the north , @entity162 and @entity163			2
the government restricts access to the @entity5 and closely monitors online communications			0
the @entity168 's latest human rights report said the government monitored email without obtaining warrants as required by law , and that all internet users were required to use one of three service providers owned directly by the government or controlled by members of the country 's sole party			2
mr @entity33 framed it as clash of ' two societies ' ; a so - called digital divide with citizens of wealthy countries able to access the @entity186 on one side , and 4.5 billion others in poor nations on the other			1
' we are defending here the right to communicate as a basic human right			0
that 's something very important in the @entity48			0
we so remind our members constantly of that obligation , ' he told reporters			0
he also said there was no specific endorsement of ' internet control or internet governance			2
' still the dissident nations said the general acknowledgement of a government stake in 21st century telecommunications was just as troubling as any specific wording			2
' internet policy should not be determined by member states , but by citizens , communities and broader society ... the private sector and civil society , ' @entity93 , head of the @entity2 delegation , told the gathering late last night			1
' that has not happened here			0
' mr @entity33 today said it was impossible and illogical to ignore the @entity186			0
' if the word @entity5 was used frequently here in @entity12 , it is simply a reflection of the reality of the modern world , ' said mr @entity33 , a @entity225 - trained engineer from @entity226			2
' telecommunication networks are not just used for making voice calls , so our two worlds are linked			0
' overshadowed by the internet showdowns were other details in the pact			0
they include agreements that could lower mobile phone roaming charges , pledges to invest more communications infrastructure in poorer countries , efforts for greater communication technology for the disabled and a move to create a common emergency number for mobile phones and other devices			0
either the 911 or 112 number will be picked in later talks			0
it 's unclear whether countries that rejected the pact could benefit from possible changes such as lower roaming rates when the accord takes effect in 2015			0
' some really good stuff ' in the accord , said a @entity129 post by			0
nxt , a website following @entity5 policy			0
but it said the disputes over possible internet controls forced the @entity2 and others ' to bail ' out on the deal .			1
