over : @entity0 , 50 , and ms @entity1 , 46 , who have two children , are expected to be granted a decree nisi this week			1
above , the couple together last year the 13 - year marriage of public relations guru @entity0 and @entity8 ’s daughter @entity7 has ended – less than a year after a family feud over @entity11 ’s relationship with @entity8 ’s ex-wife , @entity12			1
@entity0 , 50 , and ms @entity1 , 46 , who have two children , are expected to be granted a decree nisi this week			1
the precise cause of the breakdown is not known , but well - placed sources say a long - running row between @entity0 and his media mogul father - in - law was a factor			1
one source described a ‘ war of attrition ’ between the two men			0
@entity7 got caught in the crossfire when her husband sided with @entity11 after her father filed for divorce from ms @entity12 after her reported ‘ crush ’ on the former prime minister and his discovery that the pair had spent weekends together without his knowledge			1
the @entity33 – who are worth £ 250 million between them – have been dubbed ‘ the ultimate media couple ’			0
he grew his publicity business by advising everyone from the @entity38 to @entity40 @entity39 – while she founded the tv production company @entity41 , whose programmes include @entity43			1
their 22 - bedroom @entity46 country home @entity48 was once seen as the unofficial social headquarters of the @entity51 set , which included @entity52 and @entity53 , former @entity55 editor @entity54 and @entity57 ’s @entity56			0
@entity0 has also been close to @entity11 since before he became prime minister – a friendship which has caused conflict with his father - in - law			1
@entity8 accused @entity0 of cultivating ms @entity12 to deliberately antagonise him , and of sending him ‘ crazy 3am emails ’ making wild allegations			1
@entity8 was furious when @entity0 , great - grandson of @entity64 , the pioneer of psychoanalysis , banned him from his 50th birthday party last year at which @entity11 and @entity68 were star guests			1
the first public sign that the @entity73 ’ marriage was on the rocks came in july this year when @entity11 threw a 60th birthday party for @entity68 at their home in @entity78 , attended by high - profile figures from politics , the media and showbusiness			1
the freuds were assigned seats at @entity68 ’s top table but failed to turn up , leaving two starkly empty spaces			0
they also holidayed separately on different boats in the @entity89 : ms @entity1 with an old girlfriend , @entity0 apparently unaccompanied			1
a family friend said last night : ‘ @entity0 and @entity7 were deeply in love but no couple could survive the emotional pressures they have been under in recent years			1
’ they met in 1997 , when @entity7 had been married for four years to @entity97 , a financier of @entity99 origin , and was pregnant with his second child			1
@entity0 was married to @entity101 – known as ‘ @entity102 ’ – with whom he already had two sons			1
ms @entity101 , who was devastated by the break - up , went on to marry the 9th @entity106 , brother of @entity107			0
the @entity73 ’ courtship was passionate			0
when former @entity110 editor @entity109 hosted a restaurant dinner for them in @entity113 , a guest recalled them being ‘ all over each other ’ – and so keen to leave together that the supper came to an abrupt conclusion			0
sources say a long - running row between @entity0 and his media mogul father - in - law was a factor in his marriage 's breakdown but in 2000 , after ms @entity1 had given birth to her and @entity0 ’s first child , @entity130 , the couple briefly separated , plunging @entity0 into a deep gloom which only lifted when they were re-united in 2001			1
they married at @entity135 that year and went on to have a second child , @entity136 , now seven			0
also in 2001 , ms @entity1 founded @entity41 which has since expanded into a multi-million - pound tv company , taking over other outfits such as @entity140 , makers of @entity142 and @entity143			1
@entity0 is the son of former @entity144 mp sir @entity144 , and the brother of the radio presenter @entity130 , who is married to love actually director @entity147			1
his uncle was the late painter @entity148 , and his cousins are the novelist @entity150 and designer @entity152			0
friends : @entity0 , left , with former prime minister @entity11			1
the pr guru sided with @entity11 after his father - in - law filed for divorce from ms @entity12 after her reported ‘ crush ’ on the former prime minister after leaving @entity159 , he became a press officer for the @entity162 record label and by the age of 20 he was running his own company from a small flat in @entity113			1
now called @entity167 , it is worth £ 100 million and advises firms including @entity169 and @entity170			0
he became a member of @entity11 ’s inner circle , especially close to @entity173 who appointed him to work on the @entity174			2
but @entity0 ’s dealings with @entity8 have been described as ‘ wary ’ from the outset			2
according to one account , @entity8 ‘ kept him at arm ’s length ’ for the first two years of his relationship with his daughter , before reluctantly agreeing to work with him on a minor project			2
tension between the pair burst into the open in 2010 when @entity0 launched an outspoken attack on @entity187 , the boss of @entity188 , the right - wing @entity189 owned by @entity8 ’s @entity191 and one of @entity8 ’s closest personal and business allies			1
@entity0 accused @entity188 of an ‘ horrendous and sustained disregard of the journalistic standards that @entity191 , its founder and every other global media business aspires to ’			2
according to some reports @entity0 was reportedly encouraged by ms @entity12 and @entity7 to attack @entity187 as part of a family power struggle over the future of @entity191			1
it prompted a withering response by @entity187 who said : ‘ i was told @entity64 had a vasectomy in 1927 – obviously not soon enough			0
’ but relations between @entity0 and his 83 - year - old father - in - law finally disintegrated in the aftermath of mr @entity8 ’s discovery of @entity11 ’s relationship with ms @entity12			1
the @entity211 revealed last november how the former prime minister ’s meetings with ms @entity12 at @entity8 ’s @entity216 homes and a note suggesting she had a ‘ crush ’ on him were key factors in his decision to file for divorce			2
friends of @entity11 have always insisted there was no affair			2
and when @entity0 backed @entity11 , it led to a tit - for - tat war with @entity8 , climaxing with @entity0 banning his father - in - law from his 50th birthday party at @entity48 , but inviting the @entity229			1
power couple : their 22 - bedroom @entity46 country home @entity48 was once seen as the unofficial social headquarters of the @entity51 set , which included @entity52 and @entity53			2
the ban came after @entity8 similarly snubbed @entity11 by banning him from a @entity216 media summit			2
@entity8 revealed his hurt at the 50th party rebuff via a source who said at the time : ‘ @entity8 is particularly upset that @entity0 and @entity7 held a party at exactly the time when rumours were circulating about @entity12 and @entity11			1
@entity8 was n’t invited but @entity11 was			2
that was a very public v - sign to @entity8			0
’ the source added : ‘ @entity0 has been sending crazy 3am emails to @entity8 making all sorts of accusations			2
@entity7 is stuck in the middle and it has had a devastating effect on her relations with @entity8			2
’ the extent to which @entity7 had become dragged into the battle was painfully clear in an extraordinary , and in hindsight , pointed statement issued by @entity0			1
as the war of words intensified , he said last december : ‘ i will be eternally grateful to @entity8 for producing @entity7 , who is practically perfect in every way			0
on the rocks : @entity7 was recently seen out without her wedding ring			0
the first public sign that her marriage was in trouble came in july this year ' our views differ quite dramatically on a number of subjects professionally and i regret that this has caused my relationship with him to be sometimes conflicted			0
‘ but we have had good times as well as bad times , we both love his daughter and his grandchildren , if not always each other			0
i do not believe anything else is terribly important			0
’ his ‘ not always each other ’ aside about @entity8 underlined the depth of animosity between them			0
his declaration of love for ‘ practically perfect ’ @entity7 suggests he was committed to his marriage			0
@entity8 has rarely talked about his warring family or his relations with @entity7			2
however , in july , in a cryptic tweet , he wrote : ‘ asked is my daughter friend of @entity293 ? do n’t know , but hope not			0
’ @entity0 has been fiercely protective of his wife			0
when the @entity296 wrote a front - page story in 2011 about her selling shine to her father ’s @entity300 for £ 415 million , giving her a personal profit of £ 130 million , @entity0 was so angry about the ‘ @entity304 ’ headline , he threw a glass of wine over editor @entity307 ( now editor of @entity211 ) , at a party			1
last week it was announced that ms @entity1 was preparing to stand down from @entity41 after @entity300 said that it would merge it with companies including @entity312 , the makers of @entity313			0
the wine incident was not @entity0 ’s only hot - headed social outburst			2
in 2010 he was at @entity317 ’s nightclub in @entity318 when actor @entity319 was asked if he would like to meet @entity64 – even though they had a history going back 20 years			0
@entity319 declined and is said to have used an expletive about @entity0			0
the @entity324 guru , who was within earshot , then smeared chocolate cake down @entity319 ’s shirt , and @entity319 punched @entity0 in the face			1
despite such occasional volatile outbursts , @entity0 is undoubtedly generous			0
friends say that when first wife ‘ @entity102 ’ broke up with @entity106 , @entity0 was ‘ highly supportive ’			0
they say he is a devoted father to the children he shares with both ‘ @entity102 ’ and @entity7			2
@entity0 made his fortune from providing crisis management to the rich and famous			0
but his skills do not appear to extend to resolving crises in his own marriage .			0

@entity1 and @entity0 have been married for 13 years
@entity0 's friendship with @entity11 has caused conflict with his father - in - law
@entity324 guru sided with @entity11 in family row over his relationship with @entity12
@entity7 , who founded tv production company , got caught in the crossfire
family friend said that ' no couple could survive the emotional pressure '
