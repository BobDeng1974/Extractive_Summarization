by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity1 has insisted there is no longer any disharmony between himself and the @entity5 hierarchy after having a ‘ tete - a - tete ’ to explain his grievances			1
the manager was annoyed by the club selling key players @entity10 and @entity12 to @entity13 for £ 7m without his knowledge but now the money has been reinvested in record signing @entity16 and @entity18 he describes it as ‘ very good business ’			1
@entity1 stressed that his fallout was primarily with @entity22 , head of finance , for his failure to keep information about the deals up to date , meaning it was @entity10 who actually broke the news he hold been sold			1
‘ at the start of the week if someone had said to me , “ you ’re going to sell two players to @entity13 and get them loaned back for the rest of the season - then re-invest that money into buying two players , ” would i have done it ? the answer would be yes if i ’m honest			1
‘ it ’s very good business			2
we had a bit of a @entity6 , myself and the owners , more the financial people more so than @entity34			1
he did n’t have a conversation with me in that respect			2
‘ they consulted me about a possible move , but where they fell short was to tell me they ’d actually gone			2
but we ’ve addressed that			2
hierarchy : @entity1 said his fallout was primarily with head of finance @entity22 new boss : @entity1 said he was extremely disappointed with the decision ‘ i ’m quite comfortable now with our relationship , they moved heaven and earth to get me these players in yesterday			1
it ’s been an incredible week business wise , but an exciting week			2
‘ i ’d rather it be like this rather than sedate and us doing no business at all			0
there ’s no doubt it was n’t right and proper what happened , whether you ’d call that a breakdown in communications i do n’t know			0
‘ but we ’ve gone past that , me as an individual i ’m not prepared to walk away from this club			0
it ’s like everything in football , sometimes the hierarchy at clubs fall out			0
but this was a reasonably public fall out			0
making his mark : @entity34 purchased the @entity100 club back in 2012 ‘ @entity34 will be at the game on saturday and i want to deliver a winning performance for him			1
between the pair of us , we have the ability to push this club forwards			0
‘ i was excited the day i came in to work under him as manager , and i ’m excited now			1
success for him is success for me and vice-versa			0
‘ i do n’t want to big headed , but i believe i am the right man for this job			0
i want to win promotion and aim for both cup competitions			0
