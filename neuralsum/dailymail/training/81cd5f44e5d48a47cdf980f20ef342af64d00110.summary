but this lioness decided to take a closer look when the tiny vehicle crossed her path in the wilds of @entity12 - even taking a bite to see if it was worth eating			1
the car , fitted with a special camera , was used by @entity17 photographer @entity16 , 29 , to get stunning close - up shots of wild animals during an @entity5 safari			1
the car got a little too close to an elephant which almost destroyed it by treading on it			2
but his pictures of inquisitive lions are perhaps the most endearing , as they capture the animals sniffing , pawing and biting the vehicle as they try to work out whether it was worth eating			2
lionesses usually do the hunting while male lions watch their young			0
they sneak up on their intended victims until they reach a distance of around 100ft or less			0
a number of lionesses usually work together and encircle their intended prey before attacking them			0
jaws : the camera captures the inside of a lion 's mouth as it takes a bite - showing off its teeth paws : the camera captured close - up shots of a variety of creatures as they took a closer look			1
here , a young lion bats the device with its paw bashed : the camera car took some heavy punishment from some of the animals - and was nearly crushed by an elephant their usual prey are a variety of types of large mammals , but they prefer wildebeest , impalas , zebras , buffalo , and warthogs in @entity5			1

nosey : this inquisitive creature looks determined to work out what the camera car is - giving a close - up view of its nose snap : the camera catches a shot of the lion 's body as it investigates the top of the toy vehicle			1
