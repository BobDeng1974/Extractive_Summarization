@entity0 admits @entity1 have no chance of winning the title unless their away form improves			1
@entity1 stretched their unbeaten run to 10 matches at @entity8 on @entity9 , but they could not secure victory			1
instead , they had to settle for a 1 - 1 draw as @entity12 cancelled out @entity14 ' second - minute strike			1
@entity0 admits @entity1 have no chance of winning the title unless their away form picks up @entity1 settled for a 1 - 1 draw as @entity12 ( pictured ) cancelled out @entity14 ' early opener @entity21 's shock defeat at @entity22 meant @entity1 's standing in the league actually improved despite the disappointing stalemate at the @entity26			1
@entity28 's team are now nine points behind new leaders @entity31 , but the @entity1 boss knows his team would be just three points shy of the summit had they won rather than drawn their last three away games at @entity37 , @entity22 and @entity8			1
' when you want to win the league you have to win away from home , and at the minute we are n't doing that , ' @entity28 said			1
' we are n't losing , but we are n't winning either			2
if you want to be a champion , you have to win these games			0
' in reality , @entity1 were lucky to leave a blustery @entity46 with a point			2
@entity48 missed a very good chance to put the hosts 2 - 0 up and they were unlucky not to be awarded a penalty in the second half when @entity54 's header struck @entity56 's arm in the box			1
@entity1 manager @entity28 : ' when you want to win the league you have to win away from home ' @entity8 manager @entity60 was angry with referee @entity61 for not awarding the spot - kick , and for waving away another penalty appeal when @entity64 was held in the box following a frantic scramble that came after @entity54 had struck the woodwork			1
' we had two clear penalties that should have been given , ' the @entity8 manager said			2
' with the first one it was a goal - bound header and he ( @entity56 ) has made an intentional movement with his arm to bat the ball down			0
' the referee is standing four or five yards away			0
why he has n't given it , i do n't know			0
i have n't spoke to the ref about it			0
it 's a waste of time			0
' he will no doubt say the lad could n't get out of the way because he was too close maybe but i do n't think that was the case			0
' and when we hit the post from @entity54 's header it 's come back out and @entity64 has been taken out , he was waiting to put the ball over the line and was taken out			0
from our point of view they were two clear - cut penalties			0
' @entity1 , meanwhile , will be without @entity96 for some time after he pulled up with a hamstring injury in the second half			1
' he will be out for many weeks , ' @entity28 said			2
a different angle of the incident shows that the ball hits @entity56 's arm after @entity54 's header the ball clearly hits the arm of @entity106 on the way through to goal @entity8 manager @entity60 was unhappy with the controversial decision and others at the @entity26 it was a quiet game for @entity61			2
the only real talking point was the penalty for the @entity56 handball			0
his arms were up in an unnatural position , so it should have been a penalty			0
@entity1 have certainly had a lucky @entity120 in terms of penalties awarded against them , with the @entity8 incident the clearest of three			1
@entity1 had one given against them versus @entity125 on @entity126 , but there should have been another earlier in the game at @entity129 , when @entity130 tripped @entity131			2
at @entity133 two days later , @entity132 clearly held @entity134 toward the end of the game as a corner was taken , but appeals were waved away			0
@entity0 's side are riding their luck .			1

@entity0 's @entity1 settled for a 1 - 1 draw against @entity8
@entity1 came from behind as @entity12 equalised in the first half
' when you want to win the league you have to win away from home , and at the minute we are n't doing that , ' says @entity28
