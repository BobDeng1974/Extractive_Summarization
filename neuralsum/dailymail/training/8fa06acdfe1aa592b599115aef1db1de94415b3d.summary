this promotional video , ' @entity4 ' @entity3 ' , from the car manufacturer , @entity4 , shows what rural driving was like back in the 1920s			1
in short – not very comfortable			0
the featured car , named the ‘ @entity4 ’ , drives through roads swimming in deep mud and pools of water			1
the ride looks bumpy , but surprisingly the sedan does not get stuck			0
it makes sense why most vehicles in those days were made with @entity22 features			0
the car drives carefree over rocky and mountainous terrain and when it flips over on its side , it takes nothing more than a few people to roll it back over and , ' vroom ' , off it goes			2
the video ends when the car reaches an oilfield where a group of drillers have struck an oil deposit , sending black gold shooting through the air next to the parked @entity4			2
muddy roads : the @entity4 easily drives through wet and sticky obstacles pushing through : the @entity4 's wheels are submerged under the mud , but that does n't stand in its way bring it on : muddy roads with deep crevices were no match for the @entity4 over the hill : the car drove easily through rocky terrain whoops : ok , so it flipped over ... but that was no issue for the driver and his passenger who escaped unscathed heave , ho : just a little push and shove is all it takes to ...			1
@entity59 , voila : the team have no problems flipping it back onto its wheels driving sideways : even with one wheel in the ditch , the car cruised along just fine elegant and strong : this @entity4 sedan from 1922 could handle both the smooth roads and the bumpy mud tracks veteran @entity4 : the sedan car from 1928 is tough and sturdy			1
