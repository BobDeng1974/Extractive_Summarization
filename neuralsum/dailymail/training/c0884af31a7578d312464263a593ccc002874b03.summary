by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 07:06 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 19:35 est , 17 july 2013 @entity4 's spy watchdog called for an investigation into @entity7 ’s laws on intelligence eavesdropping yesterday as it cleared @entity9 of flouting the existing rules			1
the @entity11 ruled that the listening station in @entity13 acted with ministerial backing when it requested electronic intercepts from the @entity18 ’s @entity17 programme			2
but the committee raised questions about whether the rules governing intercepts are fit for purpose and whether there is a need for new laws			0
spies at @entity9 headquarters near @entity13 did not use the @entity17 programme to get around @entity7 law , the @entity11 found @entity9 faced criticism after @entity18 whistleblower @entity31 claimed that @entity7 spies used the @entity17 system to by - pass @entity7 laws			1
mr @entity31 is holed up in @entity36 airport while seeking refuge in @entity38 after leaking details of @entity41 government surveillance programmes			2
he claimed @entity9 secretly accessed fibre - optic cables carrying huge amounts of internet and communications data			0
today the intelligence committee said the claims were ‘ unfounded ’			0
but the @entity11 said it would carry out an extra review to see if rules on accessing private data are strong enough			0
foreign secretary @entity51 said the report vindicated the ‘ professionalism and values ’ of @entity7 ’s spies			1
it had been suggested that @entity9 used the @entity17 programme to circumvent @entity7 law to gain access to online communications which would be illegal in the @entity7			1
whistleblower @entity31 claimed @entity9 had secretly been tapping into and storing internet and communications data via fibre optic cables but the @entity11 said that , in each case where @entity9 sought information from the @entity41 , an intercept warrant signed by a minister was already in place			1
‘ it has been alleged that @entity9 circumvented @entity7 law by using the @entity18 's @entity17 programme to access the content of private communications			2
from the evidence we have seen , we have concluded that this is unfounded , ’ the committee said			0
the committee , chaired by former foreign secretary sir @entity78 , said it had received detailed evidence from @entity9 as well as questioning its director , sir @entity80			1
foreign secretary @entity51 said the verdict vindicated the professionalism of @entity7 spies the material passed to it included a list of counter-terrorist operations in which @entity9 had received relevant intelligence from the @entity41 , a list of all @entity7 nationals or individuals in the @entity7 who were monitored through such arrangements , and a list of every ‘ selector ’ - such as email addresses - on which the request for the intelligence was based			1
the committee said it had also discussed the @entity17 progamme with the @entity18 and its congressional counterparts during a recent visit to the @entity41			0
mr @entity51 said : ‘ i see daily evidence of the integrity and high standards of the men and women of @entity9			1
the @entity11 's findings are further testament to their professionalism and values			2
‘ the @entity11 is a vital part of the strong framework of democratic accountability and oversight governing the use of secret intelligence in the @entity7			0
‘ it will continue to have the full co-operation of the government and the security and intelligence agencies			0
’ while the @entity11 found that @entity9 had acted within the law , it expressed concern that the current legal framework for the intercept of communications was still adequate			1
‘ in some areas the legislation is expressed in general terms and more detailed policies and procedures have , rightly , been put in place around this work by @entity9 in order to ensure compliance with their statutory obligations under the @entity135 , ’ it said			0
‘ we are therefore examining the complex interaction between the @entity138 , the @entity135 and the @entity139 , and the policies and procedures that underpin them further			0

@entity11 says @entity9 operates within the law
