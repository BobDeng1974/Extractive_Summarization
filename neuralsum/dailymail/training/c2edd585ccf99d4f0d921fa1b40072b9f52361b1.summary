by @entity0 what happens after police detectives , crime scene investigators and news trucks leave the scene of a murder ? that is the question that @entity8 has set out to answer with her new photo series titled @entity10 , which depicts domestic homicide crime scenes in a new light			1
her chilling and thought - provoking images show interior shots of living rooms , bathrooms and kitchens , which had been the settings of deadly confrontations between family members involving guns , knives , and even a pitchfork			0
even though the blood had been wiped clean , its traces remain borrowing techniques from her days as a forensic crime lab technician , the award - winning photographer created the images for the series by applying a phosphorescent blood splatter solution to the rooms to highlight the traces of violent domestic crime			1
‘ all around me i observe a glowing trail of bloodshed as swaths and constellations of light , helping me put together the pieces of a violent puzzle , ’ @entity8 writes in her artist statement			2
about half of the pictures in the portfolio depict the exteriors of the crime scenes : a handsome two - story mansion with perfectly trimmed hedges ; a neat suburban home with a white picket fence ; a cheap motel room and a grey cinderblock apartment complex , among others			1
behind those plain - looking , unassuming façades @entity8 has been able to uncover grisly marks of violence hidden from the naked eye			2
the black and white photos create a compelling narrative out of flecks of blood lingering on walls , floors , carpets and dressers shrouded in darkness			0
in one striking image , a bedroom wall with a mattress and pillows still in place is seen covered in droplets of blazing white gore , which resemble rain drops on a windowpane			0
miss @entity8 was able to achieve this startling effect by applying ‘ @entity39 ’ solution to the interiors ; the chemical temporarily activates the heme molecule of blood , making it glow long after the blood itself has been cleaned , @entity123 reported			0
exterior shots : about half of the pictures in the portfolio depict the exteriors of the crime scenes unaware : some of the current inhabitants of houses where homicides had occurred had no idea about their dwellings ' dark history @entity143 : at this location along a lonely rural road , a person has been murdered with a knife and a small rod facade : the artist chose to title the images with the name of the murder weapon used - in this case , a pair of shotguns horrific details : the domestic drama that played out inside this humble residence involved scissors , a clock radio cord and a large fan a person has been killed with a folding knife inside the grey housing complex on the left ; a gun was used as a murder weapon inside this cheap motel on the right @entity173 crime : this high - end sprawling home has become the site of a domestic homicide where a pitchfork was used as a murder weapon no one is immune : the goal of the project is for people viewing @entity184 's photos to entertain the possibility that they too can be a victim , or murder a loved one out of jealousy or rage the artist chose to title the images of the exteriors with the name of the murders weapon used - shotgun , kitchen knife , scissors – while leaving the rest of the information about each homicide to the viewer ’s imagination			1
‘ as a child , when i would pass by a house where a violent and newsworthy death had recently occurred , i would stand there , close my eyes and try to imagine what took place , ’ writes @entity8			0
as part of the project , @entity8 has visited more than 140 crime scenes and talked her way into a variety of homes and motel rooms whose current residents often had no idea about their dwellings ’ grisly past			1
as @entity8 explains in her statement , her ultimate goal is for people viewing her photos to entertain the possibility that they too can be a victim of violence , or murder a loved one out of jealousy or rage .			0
