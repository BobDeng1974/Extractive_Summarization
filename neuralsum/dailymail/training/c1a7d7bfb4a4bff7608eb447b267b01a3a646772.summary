the angry mother of a victim of the @entity3 sex grooming gang last night demanded : ‘ someone needs to take the blame			1
’ catastrophic failings by police and social services enabled the sadistic group to drug , rape and traffic girls as young as 11 for eight years			1
victims repeatedly told police they had been abused and sexually tortured and care - home staff just watched as the men collected the under - age girls at night			1
but despite the catalogue of appalling blunders and missed opportunities – and @entity21 warning police and council chiefs they faced ‘ very searching questions ’ – nobody is prepared to take the blame			1
their defiance , a day after the seven vicious and ‘ medieval ’ predators were convicted at the @entity38 , came as : most of the eight - year campaign of abuse by the gang took place after miss @entity30 was appointed head of the @entity52 force in 2007			1
@entity53 ( left ) and @entity54 ( right ) were found guilty at the @entity38 yesterday @entity54 was cleared of raping @entity55 but convicted of having sex with a child she yesterday apologised for not acting sooner , but when asked if she had considered resigning from her £ 160,000 - a - year post , she said : ‘ the focus has got to be moving forward			1
i think the focus for me is on driving improvements in the future			0
’ five of the six girls were abused while in the care of @entity29 ’s social services department			1
but miss @entity28 also said she was not quitting her £ 182,000 - a - year job as chief executive			1
she said : ‘ my gut feeling is that i am not going to resign because my determination is that we need to do all that we can to take action to stamp this out			2
‘ [ we are ] incredibly sorry that we were n’t able to stop this abuse any sooner			0
what we understand now is much more about the grooming process			0
' we did n’t understand that going back seven or eight years ago			0
‘ all i can do is apologise if we did n’t listen enough , if we did n’t do enough			0
’ the mother of one of the victims , only 14 when the gang began plying her with drink and drugs before exploiting her for sex , said : ‘ @entity86 has failed our children and someone has to pay for it			1
‘ they were supposed to be looking after my child , yet the social workers went home at night knowing that she was being abused and did nothing			2
@entity95 ( left ) and @entity54 ( right ) have been convicted of offences involving underage girls @entity54 ( left ) and @entity54 ( right ) were among those who were convicted today at the @entity38 ‘ the police are talking about there being more victims , something like 50 more girls , who they want to come forward			1
but how can they expect them to have the courage to come forward when these six girls have been failed so badly			2
’ speaking in @entity110 , the prime minister refused to defend the chief constable and county council chief , saying the authorities would have to ‘ respond for themselves in terms of what happened ’			1
mr @entity21 , an @entity117 mp , said : ‘ it really is just appalling , absolutely appalling – it ’s shocking what took place			2
everyone ’s going to have to ask some very searching questions about how this was allowed to continue for so long			0
’ abuse was carried out at the @entity126 in @entity3			0
pictured is a room at the guest house cctv issued by @entity31 of @entity54 , who was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child , during an interview with the police as with similar outrages in @entity138 and @entity139 , police officers , social workers and staff in residential homes knew or suspected that children were being used and sold for sex by large numbers of men			1
but a catalogue of opportunities to stop the abuse were missed from as early as may 2005			0
two of the three care homes where victims of the @entity3 gang lived have been closed down			1
but only one person has been sacked – a manager at @entity157 , a privately run care home in @entity158 where the council placed girls , was dismissed after refusing to pay a victim ’s taxi fare when she returned after running away			1
the 14 - year - old was driven back to @entity3 where she was raped			0
@entity165 , assistant chief constable of @entity166 , said yesterday : ‘ our no 1 priority at the moment is child sexual exploitation			1
it is now ahead of gun crime			1
expect a lot more convictions			0
’ @entity54 , 27 , who was convicted of rape , facilitating child prostitution and trafficking , during an interview with the police prosecutors have pledged to 're - review ' three historic cases involving victims of the @entity3 sex ring after admitting more could have been done to investigate their claims			1
the @entity185 ( @entity185 ) said it would look again at the decision to take no further action over the allegations of abuse involving the girls from 2005 to 2006			2
in one case , the @entity185 said information was requested from @entity31 but the force did not respond			2
@entity194 , chief crown prosecutor for @entity195 and @entity196 , said the @entity185 would now be more ' proactive ' when dealing with sex abuse allegations			2
she said : ' we want to encourage people who have experienced something similar to have the courage to come forward			0
' what we should n't do is as soon as we see a weakness - the girls had taken drugs or alcohol or they lied about something in the past - that means , " this case is hopeless and we ca n't go ahead with it "			2
' rather than be fatalistic and negative , it 's about being really positive and saying , " how can we really get to the truth here ? " ' ms @entity213 admitted the @entity185 should have pursued @entity31 when information was first requested about one of the claims			0
the further allegations do not involve any of the defendants involved in the @entity38 trial , she added			2
' i think we could have been more proactive , ' ms @entity213 said			0
' of four cases we looked at , in three of those it 's arguable we might have been able to do more			0
' what i ca n't say is that we will change our decision			0
what i can say is perhaps we could have taken a more proactive approach in making further enquiries			0
' ms @entity213 confirmed a serious case review would be conducted following the conclusion of the @entity232 said she expected more cases of a similar nature to come to light as new guidance is issued by the @entity237 ( @entity238 ) in the wake of the @entity241 scandal			0
ms @entity213 added : ' i think what these cases have highlighted is that they 're probably not isolated incidents and there 's probably more of this activity going on			0
