the fire , at the @entity10 in @entity11 situated eight miles from @entity12 , started at 3am , resulting in an immediate evacuation of the building			0
fortunately no one was hurt , with only a quartet of team members taken to a local hospital due to the effects of the smoke , but they were soon discharged			2
it is the second fire @entity2 have been involved in in just over two years as the team garage went up in flames at @entity40 's @entity40 following pastor @entity43 's @entity42 win in may 2012			1
meanwhile , @entity2 driver @entity30 is fully aware he personally needs to improve , , although it is fair to say he has sustained his fair share of bad luck			1
in his maiden year with the grove - based marque following his arrival from @entity49 , @entity30 currently trails team - mate @entity32 by 43 points			1
along the way there have been numerous disappointments , including crashes not of his own making in @entity56 and in @entity57 of late when high finishes were on the cards given the current strength of his car			0
setting the pace : @entity32 ( c ) and @entity2 team members walk around the track in @entity12 speed demon : @entity2 driver @entity30 takes part in practice ahead of the @entity8 @entity7 @entity30 has no doubts his form and fortune will turn around , adding : ' it was obviously not a great race at @entity74 given the things that happened			1
' that includes qualifying and the start when i had a problem with my clutch , and then of course there was the accident with @entity85 ( @entity86 )			0
' so many things happened which cost me a lot of points because the car was amazing , it was so competitive			0
' i 'm still convinced and very motivated everything will become normal and i 'll have a good car that will score a lot of points and i can fight with the big teams until the end of the championship			0
' i really believe this is possible , and that 's the way i 'm working			0
