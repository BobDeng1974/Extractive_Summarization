a @entity1 police union has told @entity2 to stay away from funerals of cops killed in the line of duty			2
the @entity7 posted a form on its website that members could download and sign , barring the mayor and city council speaker @entity12 from their service			1
it simply reads : ' as a @entity1 police officer , ( @entity15 ) request that mayor @entity2 and city council speaker @entity12 refrain from attending my funeral services			1
the mayor and the speaker released a joint statement condemning the move			2
according to the @entity37 , the pair said : this is deeply disappointing			0
incendiary rhetoric like this serves only to divide the city , and @entity1 reject these tactics			0
' the mayor and the speaker both know better than to think this inappropriate stunt represents the views of the majority of police officers and their families			1
' @entity7 head @entity51 offered no comment friday after the letter appeared			2
' i do n’t think that ’s right ' one officer told the @entity37			0
' they should n’t be doing that ... politics is politics , but that sounds a little personal			0
last week , following days of protests in @entity1 as a result of the grand jury decisions not to indict cops involved in the killing of @entity68 or @entity69 , the mayor caused anger among officers when he said his son , @entity73 , should be wary when dealing with the police he added : ' it 's different for a white child , it 's just a reality in this country			1
' during an interview with @entity81 he said that the @entity82 was confronting ' centuries of racism '			0
the downloadable form on their website states that the pair 's ' consistent refusal to show police officers the support and respect they deserve ' would mean their attendance is an ' insult ' the letter would then be sent to the organization who would make the arrangements he added : ' we have to have an honest conversation in this country about a history of racism , we have to have an honest conversation about the problems that have caused parents to feel that their children may be in danger in their dynamics with police , when in fact police are there to protect them			1
' our police keep us safe , and yet there 's been not just decades of problems , a history of centuries of racism that undergird this reality			2
' @entity121 , who is white and married to a black woman with whom he has mixed - race children , added : ' we have to retrain police forces in how to work with communities differently , we have to work on things like body cameras that will provide a different level of transparency and accountability			1
' this is something systemic and we bluntly have to talk about the historical racial dynamics underlying ( it )			0
' @entity51 ( center ) , the head of the @entity7 , did not comment on the letter that emerged on friday			2
many were torn was to what they thought of the move speaking from personal experience , @entity2 told @entity81 that he feared for his son 's safety in dealing with the police			1
' what parents have done for decades with children of color , especially young men of color , is train them to be very careful , when they have a connection with a police officer , when they have an encounter with a police officer , ' he said			0
' it 's different for a white child , it 's just a reality in this country			0
' and with @entity73 , very early on , my son , we used to say , look , if a police officer stops you , do everything he tells you to do , do n't move suddenly , do n't reach for your cellphone , because we knew , sadly , there is a greater chance it might be misinterpreted if it was a young man of color			1
' he continued : ' there 's that fear that there could be that moment of misunderstanding with a young man of color , and that young man may never come back			0

the @entity7 posted a form on its website
allowed members to sign a letter barring the mayor and city council speaker @entity12 from their service
say it 's because of their ' consistent refusal ' to show officers respect
