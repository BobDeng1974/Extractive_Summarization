it took her 30 minutes to coax the pet out of his hiding place but he eventually emerged completely unscathed			0
sports therapist mrs @entity17 said : ‘ we 're just relieved to have him back			1
he 's so timid and does n't normally go out			0
it took us half an hour to coax him out of the motor home			0
’ found : owner @entity17 had searched for @entity9 after he vanished from the family home in @entity23 mechanics scoured the campervan for faults before failing its @entity7 because of an exhaust problem			1

mrs @entity17 said : ‘ we walked up and down the streets searching for him			2
i rang the vets , the @entity91 , everyone i could think of			0
@entity9 is a member of the family			2
he 's my daughter 's cat so she was particularly upset			0
the campervan was parked in the street outside			0
i did have a look underneath but i could n't see him			0
’ semi-retired motor dealer mr @entity99 was due , meanwhile , to take the campervan to a local garage for a service and @entity7 test			1
he broke off from the search on may 12 to deliver the vehicle before picking it up several hours later			2
a day later mrs @entity17 and @entity19 resumed the hunt , this time taking along ten - month - old @entity40 in the hope he could help find his missing feline pal			1
explanation : @entity9 's owners think he probably crept out of the engine area while the mechanics worked on the car and hid in a different part of the undercarriage , possibly next to the vehicle 's water tank mrs @entity17 said : ‘ i saw @entity19 at the gate with @entity40 in her hands and said , “ put him back , i do n't want to lose another cat ”			1
but @entity19 thought @entity40 could help us in the search so i let her bring him along			2
reunited : mrs @entity17 , 49 , said her beloved tabby @entity9 was ' a member of the family ' ‘ a little later @entity40 started meowing and i realised i could hear a second meow coming from somewhere			1
i looked up and down the street and at the houses before i realised it was coming from the campervan			0
i shouted at @entity86 to get the keys and we looked under the bonnet			0
‘ all i could see at first was some fir then a head suddenly pooped out			0
he was right at the front , tucked up beside the radiator , and we had a real job coaxing him out with some food			0
‘ he smelt a bit oily but he was otherwise fine			0
we gave him two packets of cat food and a bowl of milk which he finished in one gulp - he had n't eaten for days			0
’ mr and mrs @entity17 think @entity9 probably crept out of the engine area while the mechanics worked on the car and hid in a different part of the undercarriage , possibly next to the vehicle 's water tank			1
mrs @entity17 added : ‘ he 's quite timid but he likes the campervan and he 's familiar with it			2
there are several little hidey - holes underneath			0
he probably went back to the engine afterwards because it 's snug and warm			2
’ her husband added : ‘ the guys at the garage did a thorough job			0
he probably was n't in the engine when they opened it up			2
‘ ironically , it failed the mot because of the exhaust pipe and had to go back in			0
they would n't have had any reason to check all the nooks and crannies underneath			0
