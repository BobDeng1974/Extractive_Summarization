for the last two years , @entity0 has suffered 100 orgasms a day - but has not enjoyed one			1
the 37 - year - old is the first man to speak out about suffering persistent genital arousal syndrome			1
he developed the condition in september 2012 after slipping a disc in his back while getting out of a chair			2
since that moment he has been plagued by the condition , he describes as ' disgusting and horrendous '			1
according to medical literature , trauma to the pelvic nerves can trigger hypersensitivity in this area			1
the painful pelvic condition has left him housebound and isolated , through fear of suffering a public orgasm			1
the condition that causes him to suffer more than 100 orgasms each day after he slipped a disc in his back two years ago			1
since that moment he has been plagued by the condition , he describes as ' disgusting ' he said : ' imagine being on your knees at your father 's funeral beside his casket - saying goodbye to him and then you have nine orgasms right there			1
' while your whole family is standing behind you			0
it makes you never want to have another orgasm for as long as you live			2
' there 's nothing pleasurable about it because even though it might feel physically good - you 're completely disgusted by what 's going on			1
' he added : ' if you 're in public , if you 're in front of kids - it 's disgusting and it can break you real fast			1
' it happened to me at the grocery store and when it was over there were around 150 people looking straight at me - why would i leave the house when something like this can happen			0
' the painful pelvic condition has left him housebound and isolated , through fear of suffering a public orgasm			1
he is pictured experiencing orgasms while out playing frisbee golf at his home in @entity64 , @entity10 april and @entity0 pictured today ( left ) and in happier times on their wedding day in august 2002 ( right ) mr @entity0 lives in @entity64 , @entity10 , with his wife april and two sons @entity69 , 12 , and @entity70 , 11			1
while doing all she can to support her husband , mrs @entity71 said his condition is ' hard to live with '			0
she said : ' we really struggle right now as he is unable to work and supply for his family and i feel like all the strain is on me			0
' it 's really upsetting , we do n't do things that man and wife should do and we argue over things that should not be affecting us			0
' because he sometimes has episodes at night we took the decision to sleep in separate beds			0
@entity0 pictured as a young man , left , before he developed the condition and right as a child ' that can be very frustrating			1
you want the comfort from another person , particularly your husband , but we do n't have that			0
' i really miss the old @entity0 , we used to have a lot of fun and one day i pray that he will come back to me			1
' maybe the doctors will find a cure for this - i do n't know - i just really hope that they do			0
' the horrific condition has cost mr @entity0 many of his friends and the relationship he shares with his sons has also been affected			1
dr @entity107 , an expert on sexual medicine at @entity109 in @entity110 said : ' persistent genital arousal disorder is a condition , where the sufferer complains of long periods of genital arousal that are not associated with sexual desire			1
' pgad sufferers experience intrusive , unsolicited and spontaneous genital arousal that can be unrelenting			1
this arousal can persist for hours , days or even longer			0
' this can be highly distressing for a woman and despite attempts to relieve it with sexual activity or orgasm , this often does n't help or can worsen the symptoms			2
' spontaneous genital arousal is quite common but it 's those women who ca n't control the arousal which is uncommon			1
' i see around 20 women a year with this condition , it may be as common as one in 100 we just do n't know			1
' sometimes it may resolve on its own , there is no cure but there are a number of ways to manage the symptoms such as meditation and pelvic floor exercises along with pain medication for the patient			0
' ' he struggles to be a good father to the children because they obviously do n't understand what is happening , ' his wife added			0
' he ca n't take them to practice - ca n't play ball with them , it 's really hard			2
' despite suffering from a near constant erection @entity0 and mrs @entity71 rarely have sex			0
' occasionally we will but it 's very frustrating for both of us , ' mr @entity0 said			2
' i 've tried reading about it , tried going to doctors but nobody can help me - i do n't know what i 'm going to do			0
' i just want to get my old life back - i just want to get back what this condition has taken from me			0
' despite many medical professionals being unable to even diagnose the condition , there are some specialists in the field			0
dr @entity175 is a gynecologist who has mainly worked with women who suffer with @entity177			0
speaking from her office in @entity179 , she said : ' it 's clear @entity0 is really suffering and i 'm sure there are some people who will say that this is just in his head			2
' but it 's not - it 's a serious medical condition and i just hope he gets the help he so desperately needs			2
' being aroused can be a wonderful thing but this is not like arousal , it 's not even sexual			2
' it 's a horrendous spasm and it can be terribly painful			0
' @entity0 looks like he is in pain - not just emotionally but physically as well			2
' i 've got to be honest , there is help available but if @entity0 does n't get help soon then there could be huge risks in the future			0
' @entity197 is always a concern when people suffer from this condition - they feel like they have no other way to escape it			0
