three decades after it all began , @entity0 was back on @entity3 ’s training pitches on monday			1
the session being put on by the @entity6 leaders ’ young manager @entity7 was familiar , but the setting was not			1
‘ i have enjoyed watching @entity7 work , ’ enthused @entity0 ahead of wednesday night ’s @entity12 visit of struggling @entity13			1
‘ he ’s bright and full of ideas			2
i do n’t think the methods have changed that much over the years			0
the modern drills are a variation on themes of what managers have always done			0
when i was here as a young player we did n’t have our own training pitches			0
this land was the council ’s and we just trained on whatever bits we could , once we had cleaned the dog mess off			0
we would save the best patch of grass until friday and call it @entity51			0
‘ i remember when @entity3 beat @entity33 here in 1984			1
my dad was manager and i was in the crowd			0
the next day the lads were in training and in good spirits but the council warden was annoyed they had n’t asked permission so he locked the gates so they could n’t get out			0
’ almost 31 years after that victory over then cup holders @entity33 , opportunity knocks again for @entity3 tomorrow at their impressively remodelled @entity28			1
‘ the pitch used to face the other way when i played here , ’ mused @entity0 as he gazed out across the immaculate playing surface			1
‘ at least the away fans are under cover now			0
it ’s just as well			0
it could be a long night			0
’ @entity72 celebrates with @entity73 as @entity3 won again to go top of the @entity6 on saturday @entity0 looks over the pitch at the @entity28 stadium			1
' this place — this pitch — has changed a lot , ' he said @entity13 certainly head to @entity80 under a darkening cloud			1
sunday ’s @entity83 defeat by @entity33 was the latest blow to a team that came so close to winning the title in may			2
with @entity89 ’ team short of goals and unable to keep a clean sheet , it is difficult to make them favourites against a side that has not lost since september			1
‘ i do n’t think @entity13 will keep a clean sheet here , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ i do n’t think many clubs would			0
this lot are a good side			2
‘ i was chatting to @entity7 and he was telling me how he likes to play attacking football on the front foot			1
i like the way he uses his full - backs going forward			2
@entity7 is looking forward to this and i can see why			1
if @entity7 picks his strongest team @entity3 have a chance to cause a real upset against a @entity13 side struggling for form @entity0 looks out on the pitch , which has changed so much from his time at the club , ahead of @entity13 's @entity12 visit @entity113 stands on the terrace at @entity28 when manager of @entity3 back in 1992 @entity113 ( manager ) with his son @entity0 ( bottom right ) pose for the team photo ahead of the 1987 - 88 season @entity113 started his managerial career at @entity3 in the 1980s and son @entity0 made his professional debut for the club as well ‘ if he picks his first 11 then this will be every little bit as hard as the game at @entity128 for @entity13			1
’ @entity0 , of course , played for both tomorrow night ’s competing clubs			1
@entity3 was his second home from the moment his dad @entity37 took over as manager in 1983			1
he used to skip school — his mum never knew — to join in training sessions at the age of 12 before he finally made his first team debut as a 16 - year - old in 1990			1
just 13 league games in , he left for @entity13 after @entity142 manager @entity141 pestered @entity0 senior as he tried to dance with his wife @entity144 at a managers ’ function			1
‘ i did n’t see the positives for @entity13 on sunday that other people did , ’ reflected @entity0			1
‘ i never at any point thought they would win			0
they are devoid of all confidence			0
it ’s sweeping through the team			2
‘ and now they have resorted to playing without a centre forward			0
that ’s a bad situation			0
the players they have bought have n’t been good enough			0
it has n’t worked and @entity89 must take responsibility for that			1
@entity163 is another big name on the wall at @entity3 - the striker had a loan spell there in 2000 - 01 @entity89 is under pressure after sunday 's 3 - 0 defeat to @entity33 at @entity128 , and his signings have not come off @entity172 and @entity173 look dejected during the @entity128 defeat , which leaves @entity13 in need of a win on wednesday ‘ @entity177 is so fickle			1
i was asking @entity7 about his targets earlier and he said he looks no further than three games ahead			1
‘ a few months ago @entity89 was manager of the year and now look at the pressure he is under			1
‘ i do n’t think they should change him			0
i like @entity89 , i think he is good			1
but he has made mistakes this season and he is suffering for them ‘ it ’s been humbling for him			0
he just needs to ride the storm but there will be no bigger test than this one here			0
’ on monday , @entity0 was clearly glad to be back on familiar ground			2
former club - mates such as @entity194 and @entity195 — who has a stand named after him — are now on @entity7 ’s staff and greeted him with warm hugs , as are a handful of players the @entity3 boss played with in the 1998 - 99 team			1
@entity7 has clearly endeavoured to foster a local spirit here			2
round the back of one stand , an outside wall is adorned with wonderful team photos of @entity3 sides from years gone by			1
the former @entity210 international points out former team - mates in the team photos on display around the ground @entity0 was a player at @entity3 for just 13 games , before his father , the manager at the time , let him leave for @entity13 @entity0 finds his own vintage and points out team - mates @entity219 , @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223			1
then he spots a huge portrait of his father as a player			0
‘ blimey , look at that dreadful haircut , ’ he smiles , patting the image fondly on the chest			0
@entity0 credits the club with shaping his personality as well as his life			2
as he walks around the pitch with @entity7 on the way to training , the stands are being cleaned in readiness for tomorrow			2
‘ we used to do that as apprentices , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ and we painted the stand , too			0
the edges look straighter now			0
‘ i cleaned @entity219 ’s boots			0
he used to throw them back at me and ask me to do it again			0
he was toughening me up			0
@entity247 ’s assistant @entity246 taught me how to do an over-the - top tackle , taught me to look after myself			2
’ it was a trip down memory lane for @entity0 , who spent time looking at pictures of former @entity252 - like @entity253 ( left ) @entity0 made sure to stop off and talk to some of the club 's current apprentices , and share some advice with the young players @entity0 spent five hours catching up with old friends and memories			1
as well as watching first - team training , he also asked to visit two groups of apprentices in their classroom and left them with one piece of sage advice			2
‘ save some money and look after your family , ’ he said			0
back to playing matters , there are rumours that @entity7 will rest players tomorrow night and if he does , @entity0 thinks @entity3 will lose			1
as we spoke in a room off the players ’ tunnel , however , a photo on the wall depicted @entity13 captain @entity279 being tackled during last season ’s @entity281 tie on the south coast			2
the words next to it say : ‘ anything is possible			0
’ @entity13 should perhaps heed the warning .			2

@entity13 face @entity3 in @entity12 *quarter* - final on wednesday
@entity7 's side are top of the @entity6 table , while @entity89 ' team are struggling for form
@entity0 , who started his career at @entity3 , expects a tough game for the visitors
