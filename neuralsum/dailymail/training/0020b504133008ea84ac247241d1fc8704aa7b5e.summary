by @entity0 published : 19:11 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 04:06 est , 30 september 2013 @entity4 presenter @entity3 is suffering from @entity5 ’s , his family have revealed			1
@entity3 , who managed @entity6 after playing for @entity7 and @entity8 , is now living in a care home near the south coast after his condition deteriorated			1
he was famously chairman of the @entity12 and successfully campaigned for the abolition of the £ 20 - a - week maximum wage , which was scrapped in 1961			1
@entity3 's @entity7 team - mate @entity34 was the first @entity35 player to earn £ 100 a week			1
that has arguably led to the player power of today , with stars such as @entity39 and @entity40 earning upwards of £ 200,000 a week			0
@entity3 is fondly remembered in @entity6 after an innovative spell as manager , during which he changed the colour of the club 's kit and their nickname to the @entity6			1
this is still in use			0
he was also chairman of @entity6 , and at @entity7 and @entity51			1
if that was n't enough , he once even ran the line at a @entity55 game at @entity56 in 1972 after an official was injured and an appeal went out over the @entity59 for a replacement			1
he is probably better remembered now for his career as a broadcaster and he presented @entity16 more than 600 times			0
@entity3 moved to @entity64 in 1999 and fronted @entity65 , a panel show on which journalists discuss the football topics of the day			2
@entity3 and @entity69 at @entity70 in 1995 - he received both an obe and a @entity72 the 85 - year - old was diagnosed with @entity5 's in 2008 but his condition was made public on sunday by his youngest son @entity75 , 46 , and his daughter @entity76 , 50 , who are his two children from his second marriage			1
there is a legal wrangle concerning his welfare			0
@entity3 gave joint powers of attorney to his current wife @entity69 , 62 , and a solicitor in 2005 , when he was still in good health			2
his five children from his two previous marriages only discovered the existence of the legal document in 2008 , when @entity3 was deemed by doctors to be too ill to look after himself			1
it was only then that the law required that his children be informed that powers of attorney had been granted to @entity97 and the solicitor			0
as a result , none of his children has any say over his future treatment or the management of his assets			0
@entity3 pictured at a @entity7 v @entity106 match in 2006 - he was diagnosed in 2008 , but his condition only came to light at the weekend mr @entity107 , a property consultant and fitness coach who lives in west @entity109 told the @entity110 : ‘ he is the most sprightly physical specimen in the home , but his mind is not what it was			1
the home is the best place for him			2
that is not my complaint			0
‘ my concern is we only discovered in 2008 that power of attorney had been signed three years earlier			2
we said in 2008 that if @entity69 ’s lawyer steps aside and one of us children has joint power of attorney , we will be happy			2
‘ unfortunately , that was declined			0
we were told they had considered giving one of the children power of attorney in 2005 , but decided against because it would have been too difficult to choose just one			0
’ mr @entity107 has raised the issue with his local mp , @entity132 , the international development secretary , who passed his concerns to @entity135 , the justice secretary and lord chancellor			0
@entity137 , who lives in @entity138 , added : ‘ it is a shame that we as his children have no rights over his treatment and care			0
‘ children whose parents have married more than once should be made aware that they will be unable to influence their affairs if they register a power of attorney			0
@entity3 ’s wife @entity69 was unavailable for comment on sunday			2
in his heyday as a tv presenter : @entity3 , left , pictured with another presenter with a famous chin , @entity152 video : @entity3 linesman sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			1
