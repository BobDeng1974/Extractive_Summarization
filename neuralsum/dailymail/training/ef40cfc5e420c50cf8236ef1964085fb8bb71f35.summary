by @entity0 published : 17:02 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 06:44 est , 21 may 2013 @entity2 is to launch a wide - ranging attack on @entity4 , claiming some do not even know their patients ’ names			2
in a major speech , the health secretary will condemn the scandal of out - of - hours services where ‘ you speak to a doctor who does n’t know you from @entity13 ’			1
in a frank assessment of the failings of ‘ largely reactive ’ surgeries , he will insist family doctors must once again take ultimate responsibility for round - the - clock care			1
personal service : patients should know that one family doctor ( file picture ) is responsible for them , and even if their gp is not on call it will be clear that ' the buck stops ' with them , health secretary @entity2 will say he will liken surgeries to ‘ mini @entity29 units ’ where doctors are struggling to cope with the huge volume of patients			1
and in a response to growing concern over the quality of care outside office hours , the health secretary will unveil a new chief inspector of @entity4 , whom he says will crack down hard on surgeries that fail to provide a good service at all times			2
patients should know that one family doctor is responsible for them , and even if their gp is not on call it will be clear that ‘ the buck stops ’ with them , he will say			0
the @entity46 has repeatedly highlighted the scandal of out - of - hours care			1
last week it emerged that @entity50 , @entity52 ’s biggest provider of such care , was paying gps £ 1,350 a shift because managers were so desperate to cover evenings and weekends			0
the firm has also had to use senior nurses to cover whole districts overnight			0
in the speech , which he will make to the @entity64 health think - tank on thursday , mr @entity2 will also respond to growing problems in hospital accident and emergency units , where admissions have soared because , he says , there is ‘ no credible alternative ’			1
health secretary @entity2 , pictured in @entity71 today , will condemn the scandal of out - of - hours services where ' you speak to a doctor who does n't know you from @entity13 ' ‘ everyone agrees that hospitals should only be a last resort for the frail elderly and that – for someone perhaps with dementia and other complex conditions – @entity29 departments can be extremely confusing places , ’ he will say			1
‘ but what alternatives do we offer ? gp surgeries where it is often impossible to get an appointment the next day ; same day appointments but only if you call at 8 o’clock in the morning sharp and are lucky getting through ; long waits on the phone to get through , sometimes at premium rates ; difficulty in registering with another practice if you move home , or are n’t happy with the service you are receiving ; out - of - hours services where you speak to a doctor who does n’t know you from @entity13 and has no access to your medical record			1
’ mr @entity2 will argue @entity104 made a ‘ historic mistake ’ by allowing @entity4 to opt out of out - of - hours care and paying them ‘ not for looking after people as individuals , but for complying with a myriad of targets and requirements ’			1
he is understood to want to move away from a contract which pays doctors for hitting targets to one based on the quality of care round the clock			2
under @entity104 ’s 2004 renegotiation of their contracts , gps were allowed to hand responsibility for out - of - hours care to private firms such as @entity50			1
the new contract , mr @entity2 will say , removed ‘ at a stroke the need to think holistically about a patient ’s entire needs			0
’ it meant some of the traditional work of the family doctor , such as ringing elderly patients just out of hospital , ‘ is too often forgotten or left undone ’			0
he will say : ‘ as a member of the public , i want to know my gp			0
and i want my gp to be someone that knows me and my family			0
' yet we ’ve turned gp practices into places where it ’s a daily challenge for receptionists to cope with huge call volumes and @entity4 to get through to all the people they need to see			0
’ ' as a member of the public , i want to know my gp			0
and i want my gp to be someone that knows me and my family ' health secretary @entity2 @entity153 , @entity104 ’s shadow health secretary , said : ‘ @entity29 has deteriorated sharply on @entity155 ’s watch and it ’s not good enough for his government to blame others – it is a mess of their making			2
‘ in 2009 , 98 per cent of people were seen within the four - hour @entity29 target			2
@entity155 should stop trying to blame the crisis in @entity29 on something that happened ten years ago			0

@entity2 will use speech to condemn scandal of out - of - hours services
will insist family doctors must take responsibility for round - the - clock care
and will liken surgeries to ' mini @entity29 units ' where doctors struggle to cope
