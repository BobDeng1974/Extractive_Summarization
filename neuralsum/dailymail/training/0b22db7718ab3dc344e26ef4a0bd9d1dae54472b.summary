sick craze : @entity1 admits to taunting relatives and friends of a girl who had committed suicide by posting vile messages on her @entity8 memorial page what started as a simple wind - up on a discussion forum has evolved into something altogether more distressing for the unsuspecting victims he targets			1
@entity1 , an unemployed 19 - year - old , is what some are now calling an ' @entity18 ' - a web user who gets their kicks from taunting grieving relatives online			1
he admits to once posting the message ' how 's it hanging , guys ? ' on the @entity8 memorial page of a young girl who had taken her own life			1
but he does n't care			1
' i 've pretty much lost all hope for humanity anyway , ' he said			1
' i do n't believe that anything can save people			1
' @entity1 , who has asked to use a pseudonym , first embarked on the craze in 2008 when he took to the online forum @entity35 to provoke people discussing religion by claiming to have disproved all that they had argued			2
' it just makes me happy when i can make someone angry , ' he told news.com.au			2
' it sounds weird , but i kind of feed off their anger			2
the angrier i can get them , the better i feel			1
' he is certainly not alone as there 's thought to be a whole community of like - minded people out there			1
distressing : the rise of trolling has led to calls for tougher sentences for harassment or stalking online to act as a deterrent ( posed by model ) they do n't always target the pain of loss , however			1
another troller who 's come forward is @entity64 , a 23 - year - old mother from @entity65 , who confessed to setting up a @entity8 page aimed at taunting another mum who had posted near - naked pictures of herself on a breastfeeding forum			1
' she started getting negative replies and deleted the pictures , but i saved the pictures and uploaded them to a @entity8 group where she was humiliated , ' @entity64 said			1
@entity64 later deleted the photos after being threatened with expulsion from the site			2
' i randomly targeted a lady for no reason , humiliated her for no reason - just to be a b * * * * , ' she said			2
' looking back now it was petty			2
i 'm one of those remorseful trolls , i suppose			2
' in one of the sickest cases of rip trolling , 25 - year - old unemployed loner @entity85 was jailed for 18 weeks after targeting the @entity8 tribute page of a dead teenage girl			1
@entity91 , 14 , had been found by her mother dead in her bed after suffering a suspected fit during the night			0
but if her mother , @entity95 , thought her pain could not get any more profound , she was cruelly mistaken			0
feeding on grief : the @entity8 memorial page of @entity91 ( left ) , who died in her bed , was vandalised by sick troller @entity85 ( right ) at first , she derived some comfort from the thousands of people who posted their condolences on rip pages set up in memory of @entity91 on @entity8			1
then a few weeks later , she saw a posting that was to mark the beginning of a new nightmare			0
it was an image of a horse and cart pulling her daughter ’s coffin , with the words ‘ @entity116 ’			0
day after day , for nearly a month , the awful messages kept on coming			0
each one was more carefully crafted than the last , twisting the knife deeper into @entity95 ’s heart			0
one picture of @entity91 carried the plea : ‘ help me , @entity123			0
it ’s hot in hell			0
’ @entity85 was eventually tracked down by police and prosecuted			0
cyber-researcher @entity127 told news.com.au that the sick craze may be a sign of mental illness			0
' this lack of empathy caused people to become emotionally immune and desensitised to images they 're not seeing in real life , ' she said			0
and psychologist @entity137 , of the @entity138 , believes it is also down to the feeling of being anonymous , known as ' deindividuation ' ' social distance can cause a 55 - year - old climate change sceptic with a job and a mortgage to behave like a spastic donkey with strange malicious behaviour , ' he said			0
earlier this month , a major study by the @entity149 at the @entity150 concluded that police needed more powers to investigate internet harassment as more abusers move online to target their victims			0
current legislation means the longest sentence a perpetrator of harassment or stalking online can face is just six months , which researchers say is not enough of a deterrent .			0
