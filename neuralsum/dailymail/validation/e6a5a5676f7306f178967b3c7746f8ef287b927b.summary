a leading liberal clergyman has come under fire from traditionalist @entity2 after allowing a full @entity4 prayer service in his church			1
reverend @entity6 , vicar of @entity7 ’s in @entity8 , central @entity9 , joined in the event by reading a passage from the @entity12 at the ‘ @entity14 ’ event			1
he then asked the congregation to praise ‘ the god that we love , @entity20 ’ , it was reported last night			1
reverend @entity6 , vicar of @entity7 ’s in @entity9 , held an ' inclusive mosque ' event during which a full @entity4 service was hosted inside his church ( pictured , painting a cross on the church for @entity27 ) it is thought to be the first time an entire @entity31 service has been held by the @entity32 and has sparked criticism from evangelical clerics			1
@entity36 clergyman said the event was against canon law , which prohibits any divergence from the official liturgy			1
they argued that it could be ‘ offensive ’ to @entity43 who are persecuted for their faith			2
@entity45 defended his decision to hold the event , describing it as a ‘ very moving ’ service			2
he said his intention was simply to offer people a ‘ place to pray ’			0
he told the @entity53 website that everything his church did was legal and within bishops ’ guidelines			2
mr @entity6 said he was simply offering the @entity4 a place to pray , adding that the religions share ' the same @entity59 ' ( pictured , @entity7 's ) he added : ‘ it is very much about @entity7 ’s being a place of welcome			1
we understand @entity59 as a generous @entity59 , a @entity59 who celebrates love and celebrates life			1
‘ we try and make sure we live that out			0
in that sense we feel very properly @entity32			0
’ the ‘ @entity70 ’ was held in partnership with the @entity69			0
it was organised to coincide with the run - up to @entity72 last weekend			0
the service was arranged by dr @entity74 , a campaigner for gender justice in @entity31			0
@entity45 said the service had not put off @entity53 churchgoers and his congregation is growing			2
he told the @entity80 : ‘ we are offering a place for people to pray so it made absolutely perfect sense			0
we should be offering [ a place ] to party , we are the @entity32			0
‘ they could have gone to a community centre , i suppose , but they loved being in a church , they were just really pleased and delighted to have the welcome and it was very moving , really			0
it is the same @entity59 , we share the same tradition			2
’ at the end of the service , the vicar read a section of @entity100 and said : ‘ this is from the hebrew scripture – we all share these great traditions , so let us celebrate our shared traditions , by giving thanks to the @entity59 that we love , @entity20			1
’ rev @entity106 , vicar of @entity107 , @entity108 , said : ‘ i am appalled by islamophobia and when people whip up @entity112 frenzy , but the vicar of @entity8 has done something that is completely illegal , which is to allow an @entity31 service to be held in his church , and then he has participated as well			1
’ critics say @entity45 has overstepped his bounds by introducing other faiths			0
rev @entity120 , the minister of @entity122 ’s @entity121 , said : ‘ the issue is not primarily that canon law has been broken , which it has , but that it is offensive to @entity43 who believe that there is only one @entity59			1

@entity6 , vicar of @entity7 's , @entity8 , held ' inclusive mosque ' event
during service asked congregation to praise ' the @entity59 that we love , @entity20 '
