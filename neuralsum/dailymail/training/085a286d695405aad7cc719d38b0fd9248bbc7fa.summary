prince @entity0 : the @entity0 attended a garden party at @entity2 yesterday prince @entity0 was admitted to hospital last night for an operation after suffering abdominal pain			1
tests have revealed the 91 - year - old requires exploratory surgery under general anaesthetic			0
despite the health fears , he carried out seven public engagements this week including a naval visit , two dinners and tuesday ’s high - profile service to mark the 60th anniversary of the @entity17 ’s coronation			2
@entity0 even attended yesterday ’s garden party for 8,000 at @entity2 and spent the afternoon cracking jokes with guests			1
he left the event at around 5.30pm , changed out of his morning suit and was driven to the @entity23 , a private hospital on @entity24			1
he is expected to have surgery today and is likely to be in hospital for up to two weeks			0
his 92nd birthday is on monday			1
it came as @entity17 visited @entity29 today without her husband to officially open it after £ 1billion of work was carried out			1
prime minister @entity32 said prince @entity0 was held in the ' highest esteem ' and said the whole of @entity35 would be ' wishing him well '			1
the prince has cancelled two engagements over the past week – a lecture at @entity39 and a reception at @entity2 – but aides said this was not due to his abdominal pain			1
a royal source told the @entity45 : ‘ the @entity0 underwent abdominal tests last week and was told a few days ago that he needed to have an exploratory operation			2
the two are quite unconnected			0
‘ he was admitted to hospital by arrangement and left quite calmly – and without any panic – after today ’s garden party , where he was on top form			1
’ the situation prompts further questions about the @entity0 ’s workload and that of the @entity17			1
treatment : the @entity0 has been admitted to the private @entity23 where he will undergo an exploratory operation on his abdomen a few weeks ago , @entity2 announced the pair would be scaling back on their long - haul foreign travel , leaving it largely to younger royals			1
the @entity45 also revealed that high - level talks had been taking place between @entity2 , @entity81 and @entity82 for @entity83 to take an even more prominent role			2
it will also put pressure on the @entity0 and @entity86 – who are expecting their first baby – to become full - time working royals			2
all smiles : the @entity17 presents the @entity0 with @entity93 's highest honour , the order of @entity93 , in the presence of sir @entity95 , high commissioner for @entity93 , at @entity2 yesterday prince @entity96 is due to leave his role as an @entity99 search and rescue pilot in september and is expected within weeks to announce what he intends to do next			1
he had been expected to take up a further military post that would give him more opportunity to undertake royal engagements			0
' he was admitted to hospital by arrangement and left quite calmly – and without any panic – after today ’s garden party , where he was on top form ' royal source however pressure is now sure to mount on him to leave the forces completely and take the strain off his elderly grandparents			1
the @entity0 ’s admittance to the clinic comes almost a year to the day that he was hospitalised with a serious bladder infection during the diamond jubilee celebrations			2
at yesterday ’s garden party , the @entity17 and prince @entity0 appeared together on the steps of the palace at 4pm , when the national anthem was played			1
despite the fierce sun , with temperatures of around @entity125 ( @entity126 ) , the @entity0 appeared relaxed and happily chatted to guests as he walked around the garden			1
lord lieutenant of @entity133 sir @entity132 was introduced to the @entity17 and the duke as they made their way through the gardens			2
he said : ‘ it was wonderful to see the @entity0 with her			2
’ earlier this week : @entity17 and the @entity0 attended a service at @entity140 in central @entity141 on tuesday to mark the 60th anniversary of the @entity17 's coronation sir @entity132 said the prince had been ‘ telling jokes ’ – but would not divulge what they were about			1
with a two week stay , it 's likely the @entity0 will undergo a series of tests			2
@entity154 dr @entity153 told @entity155 that an exploratory operation of the abdomen would usually suggest a laparoscopy - keyhole surgery to access and examine the inside of the abdomen and pelvis			0
this provides a much more detailed view of what is going on inside the body than techniques such as ultrasound			0
a laparoscopy is not used to diagnose cancer			0
the procedure is often used to investigate what appears to be an obstruction , most commonly a twisted bowel , where the natural shape of the intestines has changed or a section of the intestines has overlapped			0
it is a condition more common with age			0
general aesthetics can cause serious side - effects and the risks are far higher in elderly patients			0
at worst they include cardiac arrest , breathing problems and brain damage - but these are very rare and less serious complications include nausea , headaches and temporary confusion			0
prince @entity0 ’s doctors will have carefully weighed up these risks before deciding to carry out the operation			1
the @entity0 's latest bout of ill health comes after a series of recent health complications			2
he was taken into hospital in @entity201 in august after being admitted with a recurrence of the bladder infection he suffered in june			0
the @entity0 spent almost a week in hospital after falling ill with the infection during the @entity206			2
it was the third time in nine months the @entity0 has been in hospital			0
in 2011 , he spent @entity210 at @entity211 in @entity212 after suffering chest pains			0
he underwent surgery for a blocked coronary artery , for which he had a stent fitted			0
on wednesday , the day before he was admitted to hospital , @entity0 visited the @entity218 , the world ’s oldest complete steamship , at @entity221 and in the evening held a dinner at @entity2 for the @entity224 world fellowship			1
on tuesday he was present at the @entity140 celebrations to mark the anniversary of the @entity17 ’s @entity227 and in the evening he attended a dinner of the @entity229 , the body overseeing the country ’s lighthouses			0
before yesterday ’s garden party , the @entity17 invested @entity0 with @entity93 ’s highest honour at a presentation at @entity2 , making him an additional member of the @entity237 to mark the diamond jubilee			1
the @entity0 will not be able to accompany her to open the @entity240 ’s new £ 1billion home at @entity29 today and she will perform the engagement as planned			1
on wednesday , @entity242 spoke of his grandfather ’s health during a tv interview			0
he said : ‘ you have got to remember his age , both of their ages , you know ... what they do at their age – they do a lot more than most other pensioners of their equivalent age			0
‘ if occasionally there is the odd engagement cancelled , it should n’t come as such a surprise , given the workload			0
’ the @entity17 has made clear that her husband ’s devotion and support has been crucial to the success of her reign			0
last year she became the first @entity35 monarch to celebrate a 65th wedding anniversary			1
the @entity17 and @entity0 first met in 1939 when she was just 13 and he was a cadet asked to entertain @entity271 ’s daughters at @entity272			1
in a speech to mark their golden wedding anniversary in 1997 , the @entity0 said of their marriage : ‘ the main lesson we ’ve learned is that tolerance is the one central ingredient of any happy marriage			0
it might not be so important when things are going well but it is absolutely vital when things get difficult			0
