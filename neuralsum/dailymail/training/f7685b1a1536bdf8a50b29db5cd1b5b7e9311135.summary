@entity2 spray contains two drugs which work differently to treat the misery - making symptoms of a runny nose , sneezing and itchy eyes			1
it combines a corticosteroid and an antihistamine – normally taken as tablets – which scientists say work more effectively together than alone			0

until now the medications have been prescribed separately			0

around one in four people has hay fever – also known as seasonal allergic rhinitis – but the spray is targeted at moderate - to - severe sufferers			1
it will be a matter of clinical judgement whether a patient 's symptoms are bad enough to qualify for the spray , which will cost the @entity43 £ 19 for a month 's treatment			1
with the @entity46 forecasting high pollen levels throughout @entity48 on sunday , monday and tuesday , many sufferers will discover whether their current medication works			0
@entity50 , of charity @entity51 , said : ' people often think of hay fever as a ' nuisance ' condition , causing little more than a runny nose and itchy eyes			1
relief : ' many people can not control their symptoms , despite the wide range of treatments available ' ' unfortunately , the reality is that hay fever and allergic rhinitis can have a prolonged impact on quality of life by preventing people from sleeping , working , studying and even carrying out simple everyday tasks			2
' many people can not control their symptoms , despite the wide range of treatments available			0
these people should talk to their doctor or a specialist to assess the severity of their disease and receive adequate treatment for symptom control			0

the @entity2 spray contains azelastine , which blocks natural substances called histamines that trigger allergic symptoms , and fluticasone to reduce swelling and inflammation in the nasal passages			2
among possible minor side effects is drowsiness , nasal dryness and mild nosebleeds , although the majority of users are unaffected			0
allergy : the recent sunny spells have ' rapidly brought different pollens into play ' , experts have said patients taking @entity2 should expect it to work within five days – up to three days faster than when single drugs are used			1
dr @entity106 , consultant physician in rhinology and allergy , at the @entity109 in @entity110 , said hay fever sufferers should get treatment as early as possible , particularly given the delayed start to the season			2
the recent sunny spells have rapidly brought different pollens into play , she said , adding : ' this new spray offers a novel approach because we know that antihistamine given via the nose is twice as effective as oral treatment , and when given with a steroid they work together remarkably well			2
' i really hope @entity125 will use this for patients with the worst symptoms – they tend to be those that end up in their surgeries in despair because they ca n't control them with over-the - counter products			0
