@entity0 has won a seat on @entity3 's bench to face @entity4 purely because @entity5 expects the prop to extend his dominance over rival @entity8			1
@entity4 sealed the 2014 @entity11 title with a 22 - 20 victory in @entity13 , but @entity14 replacement @entity0 held a clear scrummaging edge on substitute @entity8 amid the nerve - jangling closing stages			1
@entity18 prop @entity8 has already admitted he is geared up for saturday 's @entity20 rematch , and now @entity3 boss @entity5 has conceded @entity0 's dominance last year sealed his selection			1
@entity0 ( third left ) has been included in the @entity3 squad for the @entity4 match on saturday @entity4 's @entity8 ( left ) , in training with @entity26 last week , was dominated by @entity0 last year @entity8 is expected to be named on @entity4 's bench for the second - round @entity11 clash , teeing up another last - quarter scrum tussle with @entity0 , included after injury to @entity32			1
' @entity0 gave his @entity34 opposite number a really hard time in the final 20 minutes of the game last season so it is logical to have him on the bench , ' said @entity3 coach @entity5			1
' our bench is packed with power players so we can introduce them late on and they will give the impetus to break tackles and gain ground			0
' @entity3 have made just one change to the line - up that saw off @entity47 15 - 8 in @entity13 last weekend , @entity48 starting in place of @entity32			2
veteran @entity0 has been drafted onto the bench when @entity51 was expected to step up , with @entity52 not disguising his aims to exploit a perceived upper - hand over @entity18 's @entity8			2
@entity4 are expected to hand @entity54 an immediate return at fly - half following their 26 - 3 win in @entity58 , after the @entity60 playmaker completed his enforced 12 - week concussion lay - off			0
head coach @entity62 will name his squad on thursday afternoon , but @entity3 boss @entity64 has already told his players to heap early pressure on fit - again @entity54 this weekend			0
@entity68 and @entity69 boss @entity5 also believes @entity4 remain favourites to retain the @entity11 title , with @entity62 's men gunning for a ninth consecutive victory this weekend			1
' @entity54 is a stalwart of this @entity4 side , but he has n't played for 12 weeks and we should really test him early on , ' said @entity5			2
@entity76 holds the trophy aloft as @entity4 won the 2014 @entity11 in @entity13 last year ' @entity4 are full of confidence and showed that when they seized the game by the scruff of the neck against the @entity58 once they were down to 14 men			1
' they have won eight in a row and are the favourites for the title			0
' fast - developing tighthead @entity8 might have edged ahead of @entity87 at @entity18 , but is likely to continue to sit behind the 33 - year - old at @entity89			0
@entity87 remains boss @entity62 's only ever - present test selection , and there is no reason for that to change ahead of @entity3 's @entity96 visit			2
@entity8 admitted he was hit by a harsh scrummaging lesson from @entity0 as @entity4 swept to the @entity11 title in @entity13 last year - and is hell - bent on avoiding a repeat			1
' i was n't happy with my dealings with them last year , so i 'm looking forward to getting a chance to right a few things , ' said @entity8			0
' i suppose a year is a long time in pro sport , so as a more experienced player i know what to expect at the set - piece			0
' @entity0 brings a lot to their front - row : he 's a very aggressive player , very aggressive in the set - piece			0
' whatever way it comes , i 'm sure i 'll be squatting down against him at some stage			0

@entity0 has been given a place on @entity3 's bench
@entity5 believes he will extend dominance over @entity8
@entity4 sealed the 2014 @entity11 with a 22 - 20 victory in @entity3 last year
