for one soap fan a simple souvenir t - shirt was n't enough when it comes to expressing her devotion to her favourite programme			0
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , is such a huge fan of the long running @entity11 soap @entity12 that she has characters from the show permanently inked on to her leg			2
her elaborate @entity18 - themed tattoos include portraits of @entity12 's stars including @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity24 has spent months tattooing characters from @entity12 such as @entity21 ( left ) and @entity23 ( right ) on to his wife @entity26 's leg and luckily for @entity26 she has one very helpful connection which means her inkings are n't too pricey in the form of her tattoo artist husband @entity24			1
together the devoted pair have spent hours creating the skin - based tribute to their favourite @entity37 show			1
@entity24 , who runs his own tattoo studio in @entity8 , has painstakingly etched images of characters in the soap onto his wife @entity26 's leg			1
the couple , who say their shared love of @entity18 helps keep their marriage together , took on the project ahead of a visit to @entity50 this year			2
they will be finishing the body art masterpiece in front of an audience at the @entity55 , held at @entity56 near the @entity57 over three days from february 28 to march 1			1

@entity26 and @entity24 ( pictured ) plan to finish their masterpiece at a tattoo show in @entity50 the @entity12 montage on @entity26 's thigh includes @entity69 and @entity21 around the hip , a smiling @entity71 is at mid-thigh , while @entity22 is inked above the knee @entity24 , whose tattoo studio is called @entity74 , says that the most difficult part of the process was settling on a @entity12 character to ink			1
' we thought is would be a cool idea to do a @entity12 tattoo before we left and maybe finish it at the show			0
' the hard part was narrowing down the characters we wanted to use causing the piece to keep getting larger and larger			0
' despite all of their hard work on the project @entity24 said that they have n't quite finished their tribute but plan to work on it more once in @entity50			2
' we have fit as many classic characters as we could but may add some more in the future			0
' we got close to finishing the piece but will definitely work on it at the show and once we get back home			0
' we look forward to returning to the @entity50 @entity55 in 2016 with a fully complete @entity12 tattoo with background images and maybe a few new additions			0
' wife @entity26 says that no matter how hectic their lives become they always make time for their favourite show			2
