customers were alarmed when the own - brand ' free from ' quarter pounder prompted an alert at the checkout , informing them that the ' product has been withdrawn from sale '			1
but despite the warning , staff at the store in @entity17 , @entity18 , ignored the system and allowed the customers to purchase the burgers anyway			1
apology : @entity2 apologised after customers purchased a variety of burger that should have been withdrawn in the wake of the horse meat scandal at its store in @entity17 , @entity18 @entity2 's error followed news that prestigious supermarket chain @entity30 has become the latest store to be drawn into the scandal , as it admitted withdrawing thousands of burgers			1
@entity2 said it had launched an investigation into how the products remained on sale			2
the error came to light , when the @entity39 was contacted by a concerned shopped , known only as @entity40 , who had purchased the burgers			2
after being contacted the reporter was also able to buy the withdrawn product , when a member of staff overrode the block on the product 's sale at the til			1
@entity40 said : ' we said to the supervisor at the time we hoped the others will be taken off the shelves and the supervisor said they would make sure it gets done , which obviously it was n't			0
the supermarket giant said that the burger in question was not one of those found to contain horse dna , but that the line had been withdrawn as a precautionary measure			1
a @entity2 spokesman said : ' the burger was not among those that had tested positive for horse dna in a survey by the @entity71 , but @entity2 had withdrawn it as a precaution and it therefore should not have been on shelves and available for sale			1
' the withdrawal was voluntary , and there is no evidence of any food safety problems with any of the burgers that have been removed from sale			0
' we sincerely apologise for this , and we have spoken to the store to ensure that this does not happen again			0
' @entity30 yesterday admitted pulling six product lines from its stores nationwide after its supplier @entity86 was temporarily stripped of its @entity88 food standards accreditation			1
tests : @entity30 said all burgers had been tested and come back negative for horse dna the revelations are highly embarrassing for the store that previously distanced itself from the scandal and prides itself on the quality of its produce			1
the upmarket supermarket insisted it is ' 100 per cent confident ' that there was no horse meat in any of its burgers			1
but the company admitted it had withdrawn its frozen burgers ‘ as a precautionary measure ’ after learning @entity86 had lost its accreditation			1
@entity86 is one of three meat processing firms found to have horse dna in its products and the debacle has affected a growing number of national and international firms			1
criticism : @entity113 , managing director of @entity30 , criticised supermarkets for selling cheap food , saying they had ' got the joke that cheap does not mean good value ' @entity30 managing director @entity113 had earlier lambasted supermarkets for selling cheap food , and said the horse meat scandal was inevitable due to major supermarkets squeezing their suppliers			1
only hours before his own supermarket admitted removing some of their own products , mr @entity113 said : ' customers now have got the joke that cheap does not mean good value			0
' he added : ' if you have a competition that says , ‘ who can sell the cheapest stuff ? ’ inevitably you will get something like this			0
' what you 've seen in @entity138 food retail is packs get smaller			0
there 's less mint in spearmint gum , the taste of chocolate biscuits is not what it was 10 years ago because , guess what , there 's less chocolate in it			0
' if people are managing to a price point , they will change the specification and they will cheat to get there			0
we ’ve gone the other way			0
' although @entity30 's withdrawal came to light yesterday , the products were removed from stores on monday			2
an investigation by the @entity71 earlier this month found that @entity2 had sold burgers contaminated with horse meat			1
@entity164 , @entity165 ’s and the co-op have since withdrawn its burgers as a precaution			2
fast food giant @entity169 was yesterday accused of covering up its involvement in the horse meat scandal , after admitting it had secretly removed thousands of burgers from sale over the weekend as a precautionary measure , despite previously insisting no products had been withdrawn			1
a @entity30 spokesman said all burgers had been tested and came back negative for horse dna			1
they said : ‘ all our beef comes from our own @entity138 suppliers - we only use beef from @entity138 farms in all our fresh and frozen burgers and ready meals			2
stripped : @entity86 is one of three meat processing firms found to have horse dna in its products ‘ as a consequence we are 100 per cent confident in the integrity of our supply chain			1
the ingredients in our burgers are simple with all meat traceable back to @entity138 farms that we know			2
‘ our frozen burgers - which make up eight per cent of our total burger sales - are produced by @entity86			1
‘ our technical team visited the @entity86 site last week and were happy that our products were produced to our high specification and separately from other companies ’ products ( ours are produced at 6am before other any other burgers )			1
the spokesman added : ' when the @entity209 [ @entity209 ] suspended their accreditation of the site we decided - as a precautionary measure - to take our frozen burgers off sale			2
we understand the accreditation was reinstated on thursday 24.1.13			0
‘ as a further precaution our frozen burgers ( six lines ) were sent for testing and we have just heard that they all tested negative for any species other than beef			2
’ content : one of the @entity2 burgers consisted of 29 per cent horse meat @entity169 was criticised for employing ‘ shabby ’ and ‘ outrageous ’ tactics in its attempts to escape being affected by the scandal			1
its burgers , such as its best - selling @entity229 , were made by the @entity231 meat processor @entity232 , which is part of the @entity234			2
@entity232 also made burgers for @entity2 which were then sold across @entity138 and @entity231 contaminated with horse meat			1
@entity2 has since apologised for unknowingly selling the contaminated products			2
last week , when details of the illegal contamination of burgers emerged , @entity169 insisted that its products were not involved and so would not be withdrawn			2
however , it has now admitted that it removed thousands of burgers from sale over the weekend as a precautionary measure			0
other retailers supplied by @entity234 , such as @entity164 , @entity165 ’s and the co-op , were quick to react to the contamination news , removing ten million burgers from sale as a precautionary measure			0

by contrast , @entity169 , which is estimated to sell 60million burgers in the @entity138 every year , offered a series of guarantees and ‘ absolute assurances ’ to customers that it did not need to do the same			0
last wednesday , @entity271 , of @entity169 ’s public relations company @entity270 , issued a statement saying : ‘ @entity169 has been given absolute assurance by its supplier @entity234 / @entity232 that no @entity169 products are affected by the issue			0
’ asked specifically by the @entity278 whether it was withdrawing burgers , miss @entity271 issued a clear and categorical denial			0
but now the firm has admitted it has switched its burger supplier and warned customers that some products might be in short supply			0
@entity169 said : ‘ as a precaution , this past weekend we decided to replace all @entity232 products in the @entity138 & @entity231 with products from another approved @entity169 supplier			0
this is a voluntary and precautionary measure			0
’ shocking : tests carried out at @entity232 in @entity231 , who supllied @entity2 , confirmed that frozen burgers were contaminated the @entity295 in @entity231 revealed that it has taken more than 130 samples of burgers and ingredients in the past week from the @entity232 facility			1
twenty four preliminary results were received late last night from a laboratory in @entity302 and these have been sent to an @entity231 lab for confirmation , but results have not been verified			0
@entity231 agriculture minister @entity306 described the investigation as complex			0
he said : ' i am not prepared to draw any conclusion until i 'm fully satisfied that such conclusions are supported by facts			0
