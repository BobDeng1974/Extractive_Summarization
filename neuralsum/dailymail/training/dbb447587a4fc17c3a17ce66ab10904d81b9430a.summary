pope @entity0 yesterday signalled a more tolerant era of @entity2 thinking after he spoke out in defence of homosexuals			1
in remarks at odds with traditional rhetoric , the @entity5 refused to condemn homosexuality , saying : ‘ we must be brothers			0
’ in the most conciliatory words yet from the @entity2 on the subject of gay priests , he added : ‘ if a person is gay and seeks @entity15 and has goodwill , who am i to judge him ? ’ the new @entity0 used a talk with journalists covering his visit to @entity22 to emphasise @entity24 teaching that says those who have gay orientation should be accepted			1
the message that gay people should be ‘ integrated ’ into society rather than marginalised marks a clear departure for the @entity49			1
in recent years the pronouncements of @entity0 ’s predecessor @entity51 have fiercely condemned gay rights and at one point the former @entity0 described gay relationships as ‘ evil ’			1
speaking on his flight back to @entity57 from @entity32 , the @entity5 saved his criticism for gay pressure groups and lobbies			1
‘ the @entity61 explains this very well , ’ he said			0
‘ it says they should not be marginalised because of this orientation but that they must be integrated into society			0
‘ the problem is not having this orientation			0
the problem is lobbying by this orientation , or lobbies of greedy people , political lobbies , @entity75 lobbies , so many lobbies			0
this is the worse problem			0
’ accepting : his statements marked a dramatic turnaround from his predecessor , pope @entity51 , who signed a document in 2005 that said men with deep - rooted homosexual tendencies should not be priests but he deflected questions about a gay lobby active in the @entity87 , said last month to have been the subject of complaints by the @entity0			1
‘ you see a lot written about the gay lobby			2
i still have not seen anyone in the @entity87 with an identity card saying they are gay , ’ he added			2
nothing said during the 80 - minute in - flight interview alters the strong @entity2 opposition to gay relationships or marriage , or the @entity24 ban on actively gay priests			1
but his words mark an entirely different emphasis since the retirement of @entity51 in the @entity105 he became @entity51 , the then cardinal @entity51 said gay relationships were ‘ evil ’ and ‘ contrary to natural order ’			2
he underlined rules that prevent active gays from becoming priests , and he repeatedly condemned gay equality laws , saying they ‘ violate the natural law upon which the equality of all human beings is grounded ’			1
in further evidence of a softening of attitudes , @entity0 said women should be able to take more important roles in the @entity24 – but not as priests			1
‘ we can not limit the role of women in the @entity24 to altar girls or the president of a charity , there must be more , ’ he said in his first public statement on campaigns in the @entity24 for women priests			2
ministering to the faithful : pope @entity0 is seen on a large screen as he celebrates the @entity130 's concluding @entity131 on @entity132 , in @entity32 , @entity22 , yesterday massive : more than three million people were estimated to have gathered for the @entity131 a woman holds rosary beads and an image of the @entity138 at the @entity132 mass : pope @entity0 also today suggested that he wanted a greater role for women in the @entity24 , but he insisted they could not be priests all this devotion is tiring : @entity146 worshippers top up their tan or nap as devout @entity24 listen intently ‘ but with regard to the ordination of women , the @entity24 has spoken and says no. ‘ pope @entity151 said so with a formula that was definitive			1
’ the change of tone from the @entity87 on homosexuality comes three weeks after the archbishop of @entity157 , the most reverend @entity158 , said in a key speech on gay rights that criticism of the @entity163 ’s attitudes may be justified and ‘ pretending that nothing has changed is absurd and impossible ’			2
archbishop @entity158 told @entity165 that the parliamentary debate on same - sex marriage showed the @entity24 was out of touch with majority thinking			0
he told @entity170 that ‘ the cultural and political ground is changing			0
anyone who listened to the @entity174 second reading debate in the @entity176 could not fail to be struck by the overwhelming change of cultural hinterland			0
predictable attitudes were no longer there			0
’ he added : ‘ we may or may not like it but we must accept there is a revolution in the area of sexuality			0
’ his shock resignation in february threw the @entity24 into turmoil , at the notion there could be ‘ two @entity190 ’ living side by side in @entity57			0
but pope @entity51 ’s presence in the @entity87 has been dismissed by his successor as ‘ like having granddad in the house			2
’ @entity0 said that he does not feel ‘ encumbered ’ by his predecessor , but likes having him there to ask for advice			1
@entity51 has now taken up residence in a convent close to @entity202 , where his presence so close to the heart of power poses the threat that @entity0 ’ authority could be undermined			1
but @entity0 claimed that he is not intimidated by the former leader of the world ’s 1.2billion @entity24			1
he told journalists on his flight returning from a week - long visit to @entity22 : ‘ some say , “ do you not feel encumbered ? does n’t it make you want to rebel ? ” ' i replied that it is like having your wise old grandfather in the hose			1
when granddad is in the house he is venerated and listened to			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity51 does not meddle ‘ once he stepped down as @entity0 and it emerged that for security reasons he would have to live within the @entity87 , there was deep concern over @entity51 ’s role			1
the @entity2 went out of its way to emphasise that retirement meant just that : retirement			0
temporarily it was gripped by confusion over what name and title @entity51 should have after retirement			0
to add to the sense of finality his papal ring and other powerful emblems of authority were destroyed – just as they are after a papal death			0
when he said goodbye to the cardinals in february @entity51 promised not to interfere saying ‘ among you is the new pope that from now on i promise my obedience			2
’ but he continues to wear @entity190 white and is known as pope @entity248			2
and his continuing influence was evident earlier this month @entity0 published an encyclical or document of catholic doctrine began by @entity51 , calling it the work of four hands			1

previous @entity0 had signed document saying gay men should not be priests
but pope @entity0 says gay clergymen should be *forgiven* and sins *forgotten*
comments came as he returned from wildly successful tour of @entity22
