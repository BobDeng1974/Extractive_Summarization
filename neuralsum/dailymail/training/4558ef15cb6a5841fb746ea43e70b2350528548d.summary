' we came in to the hospital at about 7.15pm			0
at that point , delivery had n't been discussed			0
the newborn , weighing 4lb 7.5oz , arrived six weeks early after his mother suffered complications during her pregnancy ' it was a bit touch and go , and then we were told he was going to be delivered			1
' we 've been in the hospital about five or six times recently , and the staff were just fantastic			0
' she added : ' the decision to deliver him was made about 11.15pm and then by the time everything was prepared it was 11.30pm and we knew we were going to have our baby			0
' because of the contractions and the bleeding , i was really nervous			0
you never know how it 's going to go			0
' when i began experiencing bleeding and contractions at home it was heavier than before so i was quite concerned			0
