the article , which was found in a library , predicts one hundred years ' worth of style			0
1900 - 1912 : the @entity5 of @entity6 by @entity7 was published in the january 1893 edition of @entity9 and contains illustrations of what he predicts will be the future of fashion it begins in 1900 with a rather wizardly array of garments , including plenty of walking sticks , oversized hats and voluminous skirts			1
the men of the 1920s sport billowing shorts and extravagant hats , while his vision for the 1930s focuses on oversized coats with ribbon embellishment			0
1920s : billowing culottes - tipped to be a big trend this season - were the order of the day in his vision of the 20s the 1930s ( left ) were a lot more stylish than @entity7 predicted - but he was right in thinking hats would play a big part in the 1920s ( right ) 1930s : all attention is on headwear in the 1930s and it seems that the bigger , the better 1940s : things are looking more stylish by the 40s ... could those be leather trousers ? 1940s : while @entity7 predicted flowing skirts and loose - fitted outerwear ( left ) , the reality was a much more stylish affair ( right ) the 1940s , as imagined by @entity7 , focus on intricate headwear and what look like leather trousers for men - which actually took the fashion scene by storm last season			1
the 1950s and 1960s show an appreciation of layering and the ' skirt over trousers ' look that was prominent in the 90s makes an appearance			0
fashion of the 1970s and 1980s is a much more regal affair , with a big emphasis on tailoring			2
the styles of 1993 show a lady clad in an outfit consisting of a @entity78 striped @entity76 - a stylish wardrobe staple for decades now - and flowing ankle - length skirt			0
1950s : the 1950s and 1960s show an appreciation of layering and the ' skirt over trousers ' look and hats are still hot on the style agenda 1950s : the @entity88 prediction was spot - on in terms of ruffled layers but there were no skirts over trousers in evidence , at least not in the case of actress @entity96 in 1950 ( right ) the @entity97 , which published the illustrations , says : ' if indeed this was a genuine attempt by the author @entity7 to imagine what the future of fashion might look like , it ’s fascinating to see how far off the mark he was , proving yet again how difficult it is to predict future aesthetics			1
' it is also fascinating to see how @entity7 envisaged the progression of fashions across the decades - considering that , from our perspective now , his vision of 1970 does n’t much look much different to 1920 - and to see which aspects of his present he was n’t even able to consider losing to the march of time ( e.g. the long length of women ’s skirts and the seemingly ubiquitous frill )			0
' as is often the case when we come into contact with historic attempts to predict a future which for us is now past , it is like glimpsing into another possible world , a parallel universe that could have been			2
' 1970s : while there is n't a stark contrast between the fashion of the 20s and 70s , tailoring is more prominent in the latter decade 1970s : while he may have got the flared trousers spot on , @entity7 did n't predict the flower power fashion of the 70s ( right ) @entity138 fashion could be outrageous , but was n't quite as out there as @entity7 predicted ( left ) , princess @entity136 shows us the glitzy side of real 1980s style ( right ) 1993 : a lady clad in an unflattering outfit consisting of a @entity78 t - shirt and flowing ankle - length skirt was the forecast for 1993 - and it is n't too dissimilar from @entity149 1993 fashion collection in @entity151 ( right )			0
