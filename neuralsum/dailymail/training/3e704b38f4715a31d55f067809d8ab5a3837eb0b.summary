bad blood between @entity1 and @entity2 has spilled over into the dressing room after it emerged the controversial @entity5 club did n’t even feed @entity7 ’s players after last month ’s game in @entity9			1
@entity1 and wednesday ’s opponents @entity11 have been at loggerheads since last season ’s @entity14 fixtures when the @entity17 champions complained that midfielder @entity18 had been racially abused			1

@entity1 drew 2 - 2 in @entity11 , with @entity32 scoring the opening goal , but @entity2 failed to provide @entity7 's men with adequate levels of food after the match as the fued between the sides grows @entity18 was a victim of racist chanting when @entity1 played @entity2 in last season 's competition city fans held up banners during last season 's match at the @entity48 showing anger at racism in @entity11 now it has emerged that @entity2 took the petty feuding to new levels last time by refusing to provide anything substantial for @entity1 ’s players to eat in the visitors ’ dressing room two weeks ago			1
it is customary in football for the home club to provide hot food high in carbohydrate for both sets of players to snack on after a game to help them replace lost energy			2
this is particularly important in @entity70 games when teams often have long plane journeys home immediately after matches			0
in the modern age , clubs at this high level usually provide a range of food including pizza , pasta , muffins and doughnuts			0
@entity2 , however , laid on only a few bits of fruit for @entity1 to eat , leaving @entity7 and his players in a rage as they left the stadium			2

the atmosphere in the @entity1 boardroom is also bound to be less than cordial at the @entity48 after recent incidents between the clubs			0
last season @entity2 ’s top - ranking officials responded to @entity1 ’s complaint about racism by turning up to an official reception before the subsequent game in @entity117 wearing jeans , trainers and t - shirts			1
@entity122 custom would have seen both sets of directors in shirt and tie			0
@entity2 fans were punished for hooliganism and racism but the club were not happy with it @entity2 were forced to hold matches behind closed door due to persistent hooliganism and racist abuse city players celebrating after scoring their second goal in @entity11 during last month 's 2 - 2 draw last month , meanwhile , only one of @entity1 ’s top brass - sporting director @entity139 - actually bothered to go the @entity2 game			1
the next highest - ranking official on the trip was ambassador @entity143 as the likes of chairman @entity145 and chief executive @entity146 stayed at home			0
since then the clubs have been in dispute again , with @entity1 complaining about the 300 fans they believe infiltrated the game at @entity20			0
