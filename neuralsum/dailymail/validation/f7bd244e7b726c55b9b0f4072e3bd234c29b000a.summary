@entity0 is the kind of footballer who holds up an imaginary substitutes ’ board when a referee goes down injured , who picks up a matchday programme hurled in his direction and has a flick through			1
during @entity16 ’s victory at @entity17 last month , his reaction to referee @entity13 ’s attack of cramp was more comic than concerned			1
it was similar when an irate @entity20 fan chucked the makeshift missile as celebrations followed @entity24 ’s equaliser			2
‘ a referee with cramp ! can you believe it ? ’ chuckles @entity0			1
‘ he needed to come off , did n’t he ? the programme was a good read			2
you ’ve got to enjoy yourself			2
when need be , i ’ll get stuck in but i play with a smile			2
@entity0 spoke about many subjects , including his desire to play in @entity34 , in a revealing interview the @entity16 star takes his football seriously but also has a a fun side as his on - field antics show the 31 - year - old striker / winger claims he has mellowed since being involved in a ruck with @entity43 ‘ it ’s the best job in the world , if you do n’t enjoy it there ’s something wrong			1
’ that encapsulates @entity0 , one of the @entity52 ’s unlikely lads ; tough yet funny , revelling in his fifth year as a @entity52 player			1
he is delivering one - liners on the radio that amuse and slightly frighten , suggesting in the wake of the @entity59 - @entity58 flare - up that any player who spat in his face will be ‘ eating his supper through a straw ’			2
he is laughing about his appearance in @entity43 ’s book during their final fraught days together at @entity68 — ‘ a bust - up … effing and blinding ’ — having buried the hatchet at @entity72 camps			1
‘ i knew what was going to be written … it could have been worse , ' he says			2
and he is pleased by having had such a good season after an inauspicious start			2
@entity0 became the first @entity16 player to score a @entity52 hat - trick with his right - foot , left - foot , header combination against @entity83 in january and was shortlisted for @entity72 ’s player of the year award			1
all this after losing his place at @entity16 side last summer			1
his appearance in @entity89 ’s dramatic 1 - 1 draw in @entity90 in october meant he had completed more minutes for country than club : 180 to 139			2
‘ we were losing games and i was n’t getting on , that made me worry more than anything , ’ admits @entity0 , 31			1
‘ i was going away with @entity72 asking a few of the lads how many games they ’d played			1
@entity101 lads were saying , “ 15 , 20 ... ”			2
@entity96 ! ‘ @entity103 and @entity43 showed a lot of faith to play me			1
then i came on ( for @entity16 ) against @entity106 when we were chasing the game and i scored			1
since then i ’ve stayed in the team			2
’ walters flicks through a matchday programme thrown at him after @entity24 scored against @entity20 the @entity112 joker found the funny side when referee @entity13 was forced to withdraw with cramp @entity0 carries the match ball after becoming the first @entity16 player to score a @entity52 hat - trick listening to soothing sounds has helped			1
‘ before kick - off , i ’ll have my earphones on and be tuning into some classical music , ’ @entity0 says			1
he lists @entity121 and material by pianist @entity123 as favourites			2
he should be listening to some strings before playing against @entity126 in a game @entity72 need to win to further their @entity34 ambitions			1
his participation was in doubt after he suffered a fractured cheekbone a fortnight ago but surgery and a protective mask make him available			2
‘ it ’s a massive game , ’ he says			2
‘ it ’s a difficult group but it ’s in our hands			2
there will be ups and downs			0
@entity90 was a high , scoring in the last minute			0
the @entity143 defeat was a low			0
@entity141 is the main thing , it does n’t matter how			0
’ @entity0 ’s career has been in the ascendancy since he left then @entity148 side @entity146 in 2007			1
he is @entity16 ’s top scorer in a season that could still lead to a record - breaking points total and @entity52 finish			1
impressive when you consider the reshaping done by manager @entity154 since succeeding @entity155 when @entity0 ’s profile seemed not to quite fit			1
whether operating up front or , more frequently , on the wing @entity0 has crafted his game to suit the passing style now employed under @entity154			1
‘ in terms of evolving i ’ve done that my whole career , from youth at @entity164 , then @entity165 , going down the leagues and coming back up , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ you have to change your game constantly			0
‘ there are going to be technically better players			0
you see some very gifted players down the leagues who just have n’t had the luck			0
‘ i ’ll always work hard but i ’m not just here on hard work			0
you have to have a certain amount of ability			0
i was taught as a striker , all my runs , my movement , getting in the box			0
i ’ve only really taught myself to play as a winger			2
’ @entity0 has forced his way back into @entity103 's thinking for the @entity72 the striker celebrates with @entity187 after the captain scored a dramatic late equaliser against @entity90 @entity0 gestures to former @entity191 striker @entity190 ( right ) as he appeals for a penalty @entity0 is listed as a midfielder in the @entity52 ’s fantasy football game			1
‘ you get the clean sheet bonus , do n’t you ? ’ he quips			0
that flexibility has certainly aided @entity0 , who was bought by @entity155 for £ 2.75million in 2010			1
he believes @entity16 are like that , too , able to alter their game to suit situations in a way that @entity203 , his boyhood team , find tricky			1
‘ @entity154 came in with different ideas and from day one everyone bought into it , ’ he says			0
‘ we play a slightly different way but still retaining that steely grit			2
‘ certain teams we play against , sometimes we have to go a bit more direct			2
having all those strings to your bow is massive in this league , teams can figure you out			0
we can change during a game , me included			0
’ @entity0 ’s view on the game has been coloured by the health issues suffered by his eldest daughter @entity223 , who was born with gastroschisis , a condition in which the intestines protrude outside the abdomen			1
in 2005 he switched from @entity101 side @entity229 to @entity230 so as to be closer to his family on the @entity232 when @entity223 needed surgery			0
‘ i asked to leave to go back home with her as she was so ill , ’ he said			0
‘ i was living in a hospital for three months			0
’ @entity223 , 10 , is better now , with a sister and brother aged six and four			0
@entity0 has picked himself up too , joining @entity68 in 2007 before @entity16 came calling			1
that move was the reason for his fallout with @entity43 , who details in his autobiography how @entity0 did not believe him that no enquiry had been made			1
‘ there was a bit of shoving , ’ writes @entity43			1
‘ i got carried away and @entity0 got carried away			1
’ @entity249 ' goal against @entity106 in october saw him cement a regular starting place in @entity154 ' team @entity0 has adjusted his game to make an impression both domestically and internationally this season @entity0 had felt compelled to send in a photograph of his vomit to prove he was sick enough to miss an earlier @entity257 game			1
here , sitting in an armchair at @entity16 ’s training ground , he smiles knowingly			1
the pair shook hands after @entity43 became @entity103 ’s assistant			1
‘ when he first came to @entity89 we spoke about it and had a laugh			0
i get on really well with @entity43			1
i know he can be hard but he ’s pretty spot on in what he says			0
’ @entity0 tends not to mince words either , choosing that rather graphic turn of phrase to air his views on spitting			2
he knows though , with team - mate @entity275 ’s horrific leg wound in mind , more serious things happen on a pitch			0
‘ it ’s an insult to spit , ’ he says			0
‘ anything that threatens a career , breaks bones , or seriously injures someone has to be worse			0
’ feigning injury does infuriate him			0
‘ to see people rolling round when they get touched is poor			0
what annoys me is to think about if two people are going head to head in the street , would one fall over like they ’ve been shot ? ’ @entity0 has made up with former @entity68 manager @entity43 after the pair 's infamous bust up the @entity112 forward nets against @entity293 in november , he has 10 @entity52 goals this term @entity0 is made from stern stuff and hates it when players feign injury on the football pitch one creeping concern is his contract , which expires in the summer of 2016			1
‘ it ’s always at the back of your mind			0
we have n’t had any talks yet			0
they ’re always looking for someone to replace you			0
it ’s been no different since i ’ve been here			0
‘ the strikers we ’ve had in : @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 is here , @entity323			0
if the club want to keep me , they will come to me			0
’ @entity0 is recently over a mystery knee injury that had troubled him for more than a year and believes he can play until he ’s 38			1
‘ fitness-wise i tend to do more running , more high - intensity sprints , more recoveries than anyone			0
we have heart - rate monitors every day			0
you have to look after yourself off the pitch through diet			0
i have six , seven years , without a shadow of a doubt			0
