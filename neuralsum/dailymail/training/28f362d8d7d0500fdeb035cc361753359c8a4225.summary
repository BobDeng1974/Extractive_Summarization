by @entity0 published : 03:11 est , 17 june 2012 updated : 04:04 est , 17 june 2012 @entity1 is at the centre of a row over tobacco advertising after anti-smoking charities accused him of promoting a company that owns one of @entity9 's biggest cigarette brands			1
the @entity11 and @entity12 footballer features in billboard advertisements and @entity15 videos in @entity16 that promote @entity18 's internet - based sports channel , @entity19			1
but the company is one of @entity16 's largest tobacco firms and its cigarettes , flavoured with spices such as cloves and cinnamon , are popular with children			1
a spokesman for @entity1 , who supports the global children 's charity @entity29 , insisted that the footballer , who does not smoke , was advertising the sports channel and not tobacco			2
apology : @entity12 said @entity1 was sorry for any misunderstanding resulting from his appearance in the ads it appears that @entity1 , one of many international football stars to appear in the ads , had been unaware that @entity18 makes much of its profits from tobacco or that his image would be used on billboards which carry the cigarette brand logo			1
its @entity47 channel shows @entity49 football matches and helps to raise the profile of @entity52 football in @entity9 , the spokesman added that @entity1 was consulting lawyers about the use of his image in the campaign			2
the @entity57 predicts smoking will kill one billion people worldwide this century			0
@entity60 , chief executive of the anti-smoking group @entity61 , said sponsorship deals such as this were banned in the @entity64 because of concerns that they promoted cigarettes to young people			0
she also called on @entity1 to dissociate himself from @entity18			2
' @entity68 talks a good talk about putting children first when he tweets for @entity29 , but he has to put his money where his mouth is , ' ms @entity60 told @entity74			0
' well over a third of 15 - year - old boys in @entity16 smoke and smoking rates among the young have increased sixfold since 1995			2
' @entity68 is estimated to be worth £ 40m and to earn more than £ 100,000 a week ; does he really need to do this ? ' i hope now he realises what he 's done he 'll apologise			0
' complaint : @entity16 's @entity83 has written to @entity12 boss sir @entity84 to complain about the ads featuring @entity1 separately , @entity16 's @entity83 has written to the @entity12 manager sir @entity84 urging him ' to have this unhealthy promotion removed immediately '			1
in the @entity15 videos , @entity1 , wearing a red football kit and displaying the @entity18 corporate badge , says how ' football is everything and everything about football is only on @entity47 '			2
the final scene cuts to the @entity47 logo , which is then followed by the @entity98 logo and a tobacco health warning			0
tobacco firms worldwide are keen to cultivate the next generation of smokers , but their efforts are hampered by blanket advertising bans in @entity105			0
no such laws apply in @entity16 , where @entity18 also operates a music website - which anti-smoking groups claim is another attempt to reach young people			1
@entity111 , the director of @entity112 , which is campaigning for cigarettes to be sold in plain packets in the @entity64 , said : ' i do n't believe that it is a coincidence that @entity18 chose a @entity12 player to promote their brand sponsorship of @entity16 football , as the iconic @entity12 kit so closely resembles their own cigarette brand colours			1
' @entity125 , from the @entity124 , told @entity126 : ' we must be concerned about the prevalence of smoking internationally , particularly in the developing world , where it is a major killer			0
' it is particularly galling to see a prominent @entity64 celebrity recognised by young football supporters the world over participating in such a distasteful and ill - advised campaign			0
' a @entity12 spokeswoman told @entity74 : ' the contractual agreement between @entity68 and @entity137 runs to 31 october 2012 , at which time all forms of advertising will cease			0
' both @entity12 and @entity1 are sorry for this misunderstanding and will endeavour to ensure that it is not repeated in the future			1

anti-smoking charities accuse the @entity11 star of promoting @entity16 tobacco firm @entity18
@entity1 's club @entity12 says he is ' sorry for this misunderstanding '
