but the jury convicted him , rejecting his claim that he was not the attacker and was several miles away renovating a house			2
miss @entity10 was six months pregnant when she answered the door to a masked attacker on march 24 , thinking it was an estate agent who had come to view her flat			1
@entity42 , prosecuting , said : ' @entity10 then heard a knock on the door of her flat			1
she opened the door , which was then pushed violently from outside , and she was either pushed or punched to the floor			0
' she was then attacked with multiple punches to her stomach and back , in a way which targeted her unborn child			2
she shouted for help and a gloved hand was placed over her mouth			0
' she pointed out valuable items in case this was a robbery or burglary but her attacker showed no interest in taking anything			0

' the male said he would tie her up			0
she was absolutely terrified about what was happening to her in her own home			0
' the attack only ended because the estate agent turned up and @entity5 fled , using a back door as he knew the block well and had owned the flat before selling it to @entity17			1
sentencing @entity5 , @entity74 of @entity24 , judge @entity75 , told him : ' it was a pernicious and evil attack			1
on your part there was a high degree of planning			1
' it was clear that you used your skills and training as a police officer to ensure your phone was left to give yourself an alibi and you masked your appearance			0
' @entity5 looked likely to faint in the dock and he kept saying : ' i did n't do it ' as the judge told him he made one mistake of not disposing of the @entity96 trainer box even though he destroyed all his other clothes - a factor the judge believed that had led the jury to find him guilty			1
he shook his head after being unanimously convicted by a jury following more than seven hours ' deliberation			0
he told @entity105 he had now lost his career , his future and his liberty by his ' appalling ' actions that had thankfully not led to serious harm to @entity17 or the baby			0

' this verdict has given me some closure and i can now hopefully start to move on with my life and build a future for me and my son			0
' senior investigating officer detective inspector @entity138 , from @entity139 , said after the case : ' this was a dreadful and calculated attack on a pregnant woman , made all the more chilling because @entity5 was a police officer at the time he planned and carried out this shocking assault			1
' not accepting @entity10 's decision to have the baby , @entity5 tried to take matters into his own hands and carefully planned the attack - using his policing knowledge in an attempt to throw detectives off his trail			1
' it was inevitable that he would make mistakes , however , and it is a testament to the hard work of the investigation team , and the bravery of @entity10 and the witnesses , that his dishonest and wicked behaviour was exposed to the jury			2
' ' every day when she looks at her healthy young son , she will be reminded of his father			0
' @entity5 was linked to the crime by a jigsaw puzzle of evidence that presented a ' compelling picture ' that he was the attacker who carried out the ' savage attack ' and the jury of five women and seven men agreed			1

@entity5 took a size 10 shoe and when his home was searched , a @entity96 box was found that had originally held size 10 @entity190 trainers			2
he admitted he used to have the same trainers and had thrown them away several years previously but the prosecution said he had made a mistake			0
@entity200 found a hooded man reconnoitring the route to the flat an hour before the attack and @entity5 's mobile phone was tracked to the same area at the same time			1
it was the route the hooded attacker took when he fled , which was also caught on @entity200			0
analysis found that the man on the @entity200 was 6ft 1in tall and @entity5 is 6ft 1in tall			2
police also found out the vacuum cleaner the attacker carried was a @entity215 model and one of similar appearance was given to the defendant 's brother and kept in a communal area but disappeared after the attack			0
@entity5 , who resigned from @entity139 in november last year , was ' forensically aware ' and had used his police experience to try to avoid detection , the court heard .			1
