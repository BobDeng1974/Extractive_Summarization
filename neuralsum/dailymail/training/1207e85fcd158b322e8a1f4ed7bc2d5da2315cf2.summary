by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:52 est , 4 october 2012 updated : 01:59 est , 5 october 2012 @entity2 has given ministers until the end of the week to find the money to help the heroes of @entity7 pay for the unveiling of a memorial to their fallen comrades			1
the prime minister intervened last night to insist that the shortfall for the cost of staging the event in june , which was attended by the @entity17 , will be met by the government			1
anxious second world war veterans had feared losing their homes as ministers refused to fill a £ 550,000 gap in funding for the poignant ceremony			1
poignant : the memorial in @entity25 depicts airmen returning from a raid and the @entity12 has given ministers until the end of the week to help pay for its unveiling survivors had already raised £ 6.5million to build their own monument to recognise the sacrifice and bravery of the 55,573 comrades – nearly half the unit – who lost their lives during raids against the @entity39			1
but the hard - pressed @entity41 trustees had also found themselves liable for the outstanding bill for the unveiling ceremony in @entity25 , central @entity44 , which attracted more than 6,500 veterans , widows and children			1
until now , pleas to ministers for financial assistance to settle invoices from firms who provided seating , security , insurance and catering have fallen on deaf ears			1
but last night , @entity60 sources said mr @entity2 had ordered a u-turn			1
culture secretary @entity62 is expected to announce that her department will make up the shortfall as early as today			1
‘ the prime minister has taken a personal interest , given all the concerns that have been raised			1
he has said we need to find a way to sort this out and find the money that they need , ’ said one source			1
‘ @entity60 is working with the @entity74 and we will have a result by the end of the week			1
we need to have a conversation with @entity7 to establish precisely what they need and then we will find the money across @entity18			1
‘ given the role veterans played in the @entity82 , and the commitment of all those involved in the memorial , the prime minister feels strongly that this is the right thing to do			1
’ earlier in the day , former @entity87 defence minister sir @entity86 had urged ministers to ‘ bite the bullet ’ and make up the difference			1
the @entity17 and prince @entity91 , right , talk to a former member of @entity7 , after unveiling the @entity93 in @entity25 in june praising the ‘ decisive ’ move , he said last night : ‘ i am absolutely delighted			2
i know the prime minister has a very deep affection for the @entity97 and it is excellent news that this now looks like it is going to be resolved			1
‘ the veterans made provision for a modest ceremony			1
but such was the public support and enthusiasm to honour those who gave their lives that the cost of the day itself increased enormously			2
‘ it would have been unthinkable that these guys should be required to dip into their own pockets			2
’ the government has already waived £ 1million in @entity114 on building the memorial and provided £ 375,000 - worth of support for the ceremony in the form of @entity120 personnel and aircraft			2
this was on top of £ 200,000 from the @entity124			2
earlier in the day , mobile phone tycoon and philanthropist @entity125 , who contributed £ 1.8million towards the memorial , had tried to shame ministers into action by suggesting he would make a further contribution as ‘ a last resort ’ if necessary			1
the @entity133 founder said last night : ‘ i have got to know a lot of these trustees as friends and the stress of all this has affected their health			2
if the prime minister has sorted it out , that is fabulous			1
i think it ’s completely outrageous that the trustees have been in this position and i am not prepared to see them lose their homes			1
’ by @entity147 so three bold old men can now sleep more soundly in their beds – and the relatives of 55,573 heroic airmen can allow their blood pressure to return to normal			2
the extraordinary saga of the @entity7 memorial would appear to have been resolved and the trustees behind this magnificent monument will not be left to shoulder a thumping £ 550,000 bill for the opening ceremony after all			2
following an appeal by the @entity162 , a generous offer by the philanthropist , @entity125 , and the wise intervention of the prime minister , common sense has prevailed			1
saga resolved : the scene in @entity25 in june when the @entity17 unveiled the memorial as the @entity162 reminded its readers yesterday , the new memorial , opened just over three months ago by the @entity17 , was long overdue			2
while all the other notable participants in the @entity82 have long had a national monument to their endeavours , there had been none to the men with the bleakest life expectancy of the lot			2
nearly half of the 125,000 men in @entity7 perished			2
come peacetime , though , the bombing of @entity184 cities sat uncomfortably with the narrative of victory			0
there would n’t even be a campaign medal			0
yet , the fact remained that 55,573 families had lost a father , husband , brother or son			0
where were they to lay their wreaths ? four years ago , @entity199 singer @entity198 – whose family had worked in the factories which built @entity203 bombers – joined forces with a team of volunteers to make amends			0
it was a long haul but they managed to raise the £ 6.5million required to build an appropriate monument			0
and very fine it is too – poignant , proud yet utterly non-triumphal			0
it even includes a dedication to all those who died , the bombed as well as the bombers			0
when it came to this summer ’s opening ceremony , the trustees received early ministerial assurances that the government would help cover the costs of a dignified event			0
but they were victims of their own success			0
the event ballooned into a state occasion with a huge royal , diplomatic , political and military turnout ( plus all the consequent security )			0
applications from veterans and bereaved families were treble the original estimate			1
the @entity41 , while delighted by all the interest , was a little overwhelmed			0
on the eve of the ceremony , for example , the trustees were stunned to be handed a fresh insurance demand for £ 50,000			0
one of the organising committee managed to produce a personal cheque for £ 22,000 just to secure enough portable loos			0
to make things worse , it would later turn out that those ministerial assurances had not been set in stone			0
some , like the @entity124 , did their bit and paid up			0
the @entity249 even tried to present its @entity203 flypast as payment in lieu			0
that was little comfort to the eight trustees – three of them veterans – this week as they found themselves liable for a £ 550,000 deficit			1
yes , they were not as thorough as they should have been in their financial management			0
but who can blame them ? they were organising an unveiling , not a state occasion			0
they are n’t clever accountants or civil servants			0
they are that great @entity268 institution without which civic society would fall part – a committee of volunteers			0
and they have achieved a great thing with their memorial			0
it would have been wholly unjust for them to be punished for it .			0
