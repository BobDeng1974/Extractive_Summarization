@entity9 describes the relationship now as a transaction			2
he says when he debuted ' @entity94 ' for her on her birthday , she asked him deadpan ' do i get the publishing , too ?

third time : @entity9 reportedly picked up @entity147 in a hotel lobby when she was a college student , before the two married in 2004 striking : @entity9 said he took @entity149 to a performance of his own musical during one of their first dates , though she did n't know who the fading songwriting star was then touring constantly to make up for his past financial struggles , @entity9 became worn down by a life on the road and strained the marriage			1
one night in 1993 , after a concert at @entity162 , rather than go home to @entity31 , @entity9 booked a hotel			1
a band member told @entity31 that @entity9 was unfaithful that night , a claim @entity9 denies but one that led to his eventual split with her			1
' @entity31 likes to joke that the end of the marriage spelled the end of my songwriting career , ' @entity9 said , but it became a reality , as the next two decades saw him write and record very little			1
instead , he drank and spiraled into depression			0

the two married in 2004 , when @entity149 was 23 and @entity9 was 55 , moving into a $ 4million penthouse in @entity194 together			1
while the relationship did n't spur @entity9 to new songwriting endeavors as it had with his past two wives , but it did eventually unravel just the same			0
@entity9 was in and out of rehab , but at @entity149 's insistence went back on tour , often playing shows with @entity202			2
@entity149 herself became a fixture in the art scene			0
one day @entity9 saw a photo of her dancing with another man at a gallery showing at @entity211 , though she rebuffs any accusations of an affair			2
@entity9 could not handle his jealousy , and @entity149 seemed uninterested in couples counseling that he suggested			0
' i realized , it ’s not going to happen , ' @entity9 said , and told her ' we ’re over			0
just do n’t send me messages , do n’t leave me cute little phone calls , do n’t tease me , do n’t f --- with me , just end it			0
' ' i ’m an old man now , a vulnerable man			0
do n’t do that to an old guy			0
’ the pair divorced in 2009			0
it now seems the man once described by music critic @entity229 as a ' force of nature and bad taste ' has cut back on his time in the spotlight			0
though he released an album of classical compositions in 2001 and in spite of still touring arenas , @entity9 has n't released studio music for a solid two decades			2

' you can have all the money in the world , you can have mansions , you can have properties , you can have yachts , you can have limousines , you can have motorcycles , ' he told @entity17			0
if you do n't have love , ' it does n’t mean a goddamn thing			0
