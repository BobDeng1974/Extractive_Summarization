an unemployed man won a £ 53,000 @entity1 and £ 10,000 in cash after spending £ 250 of his benefits money on a spot - the - ball contest			1
@entity7 , 52 , bought 50 £ 5 tickets when he saw the competition in his local shopping centre			1
but he was criticised last night for using his benefits on a frivolous competition instead of essentials			1
one neighbour said last night : ‘ it ’s sickening that i have to work two jobs to feed my family and that prat is spending my taxes spotting balls			2
’ another resident added : ‘ welcome to benefits @entity22			2
will he declare his good fortune to the benefits office ? it makes me wonder how much else he has spent trying to win something			1
’ mr @entity7 , from @entity27 , @entity28 , receives disability benefits after breaking his back in a car crash in 2004			1
' i ’ve not been well and it ’s got me down			0
but this has cheered me up			0
i was n’t going to put all my benefits on – it was controlled			2
i ’m not an addicted gambler			0
’ the bachelor , who was driving a 15 - year - old @entity51 before winning the @entity52 , said the new car ’s leather interior ‘ should cushion my back ’			1
mr @entity7 said he would tell welfare officals of his win and intended to continue claiming benefits			1
mr @entity7 has shrugged off criticism of his win , insisting he can spend his benefits money on whatever he likes he also insisted his critics were merely envious , adding : ‘ i won and i was so happy – but it ’s frustrating now because people are complaining that i spent benefits on it			1
what has it got to do with anyone ? ‘ it ’s ridiculous			0
i got a bit of good fortune and it ’s no one ’s business how that happened			0
it ’s giving people with benefits bad publicity because it looks like we ’ve got money to throw around			1
i do n’t gamble , i do n’t drink , i do n’t smoke , i do n’t have meals out			0
' i just sit at home and watch telly			0
i ’ve gone from rags to riches – it ’s like @entity88			0
' people are just negative and jealous and want to bring others down			0
i ’ve been unwell and that ’s why i ’m on benefits			2
' i ’ve been unemployed for a while			0
there ’s not a lot of work around at the moment			2
’ he said his bad back and 6ft 3in frame made getting in and out of the @entity101 a challenge , adding : ‘ the @entity1 will be a lovely change			1
’ however , mr @entity7 , who has already sold his purple @entity104 to a local garage for £ 400 , said he would probably have to sell the @entity1 eventually because he can not afford to run it			1
he is planning to spend some of the £ 10,000 on a holiday to ‘ somewhere nice and hot ’ , and said he may also give some to charity			1
he discovered he had won when @entity109 , whose company @entity110 runs the competition , surprised him at his terraced home on tuesday			2
after being shown the car , which had a briefcase with £ 10,000 in cash in the boot , mr @entity7 sprayed champagne in the street , saying : ‘ it ’s absolutely brilliant			1
i think i could get used to this			0
’ mr @entity109 said : ‘ he was pretty speechless			0
no one expects to be swapping from a @entity51 to a @entity1 on the same day			0
’ @entity123 , of the @entity124 ’ @entity122 , said : ‘ people can spend their benefits on whatever they want			2
' but taxpayers ’ anger that their cash has been used to win a swanky @entity1 is understandable			0
‘ there ’s nothing to stop mr @entity7 giving some of the cash back to the government , and plenty of people will expect he ’ll do just that			1

@entity147 *pocketed* £ 10,000 and is now driving a @entity34
angry locals and *campaigners* call for him to hand back winnings to state
but he insists : ' what **'s** it got to do with anyone else how i spend the money '
he **'s** planning holiday in the *sun* and says new car will help his back
