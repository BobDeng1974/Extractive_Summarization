rivals : either @entity21 or @entity27 could face @entity6 in the final in @entity44 on monday @entity21 2 - 2 @entity27 ( @entity21 win 3 - 1 on penalties ) setting : the tournament has been played at some of @entity70 's best venues - including @entity71 should @entity6 beat the @entity26 winners , they will top @entity11 , face another long flight from the @entity75 to the south east for the final , be forced to stay @entity78 for a few more days , and play another match on this pre-season tour which @entity55 has dismissed as a ' commercial activity '			1

meanwhile , in @entity19 , only @entity22 are out of the running for a place in the final as @entity21 and @entity27 sit best placed to make the final			2
@entity119 ' @entity21 side are top of the group with five points , three for their 1 - 0 win over @entity29 in @entity123 and two for their shootout win over @entity27 at @entity71			2
