the boss of the @entity2 supermarket chain admitted he would not eat cheap own - brand food products – because they ‘ wo n’t contain much meat ’			1
@entity5 also claimed the horse meat scandal was a ‘ storm in a tea cup ’ , and insisted that supermarkets should not be blamed for it			1
most supermarkets sold three types of products , he said – premium , standard and economy – and he would not eat the economy product			2
opinion : @entity5 , chief executive of frozen food firm @entity2 , said supermarkets are less at fault for the horsemeat problem and slammed councils for awarding food contracts ' based purely on one thing - price ' ‘ @entity2 has never sold economy products – we do not sell cheap food , ’ he said			1
‘ we have one brand of food , one level of food			2
we know where all our food comes from , we follow the supply chain right the way through and it ’s very short			2
’ he added : ‘ i would n’t eat value supermarket products because they wo n’t contain much meat			0
there will be other things in there , whether it ’s rusk or filler or whatever it is			0
’ mr @entity5 , whose chain has removed beef products which tested positive for traces of horse dna , denied that horse meat was endemic in the food chain			1
he insisted @entity51 ’s supermarkets ‘ should n’t be blamed ’ for contamination and claimed they had ‘ a fantastic reputation for safety ’ of products			0
instead , he blamed local councils for the scandal , saying they had compromised food quality by trying to drive down the prices of catering contracts for schools and hospitals			1
mr @entity5 said : ‘ supermarkets carry out an enormous range of testing procedures on every product that bears their name			1
' okay , you can say we have n’t been testing for horse			0
well , why would we ? we do n’t test for hedgehog either			0
’ products @entity74 fears : @entity76 , the managing director of @entity77 , warned consumers could pay the price for the scandal , as ensuring food has the best safety guarantees means it can no longer be seen as a ' cheap commodity ' he told the @entity84 that supermarket products did not contain horse meat , even though the scandal erupted last month when @entity88 were found to be 29 per cent horse meat			1
@entity88 then admitted the ‘ minced beef ’ in its frozen bolognese was up to 100 per cent horse meat			0
‘ if we ’re going to blame somebody , ’ mr @entity5 said , ‘ let ’s start with local authorities because there ’s a whole side to this industry which is invisible			1
trolley : almost two thirds of respondents now plan to buy meat only from their local butchers , according to a new survey ( file picture ) talks : environment secretary @entity108 has called on supermarkets to do more to explain to customers how horsemeat entered the food chain ‘ that ’s the catering industry			2
schools , hospitals – it ’s massive business for cheap food and local authorities award contracts based purely on one thing : price			1
’ an angry mr @entity5 then told @entity123 : ‘ supermarkets are on the high street , they ’re very visible , and they ’ve taken all the blame for this and that ’s not right			1
‘ i do n’t believe that any horse flesh has actually ended up in a @entity51 supermarket , [ it ’s ] traces , microscopic contamination quantities			0
' the @entity88 problem was a filler , it was n’t meat at all , it was a filler that they put into a cheap burger			0
‘ this is a storm in a tea cup – it ’s over-hyped			0
’ investigation : @entity143 chief executive @entity142 said that testing was the right way to address the issue , and said the focus would be on areas of higher risk investigation : one of the plants raided , @entity151 in @entity152 , said it was ' co-operating with local trading standards officers and the @entity143 ' the @entity2 boss ’s comments provoked anger from the @entity159 , which accused mr @entity5 of passing the buck and said local authorities did not handle catering contracts for hospitals			1
a spokesman said : ‘ the law is 100 per cent clear that it is the responsibility of the manufacturer , supplier and retailer to make sure the product they sell us is what they say it is			0

the companies that supply our food need to take responsibility			0
