a mother - of - two lost nine stone after being told she was too fat to have surgery on her varicose veins			1
@entity4 , 43 , had the bulging veins all over her legs and was desperate to get them removed as they were so painful and unsightly			1
at over 19 stone , she also suffered several other health problems including diabetes , high blood pressure and high cholesterol			1
she is pictured three months after finally having the operation before the diet , she was over 19st and suffered from diabetes , high blood pressure and high cholesterol her love of burgers , curry and huge pizzas loaded with cheese had left her with a @entity26 of 47 and a size 22			2
however it was n't until she was told by doctors that varicose vein surgery would be too risky that she decided to lose the weight			1
mrs @entity4 , a full - time mother , said : ' at the time , i was probably oblivious to how big i was			1
' i hid behind baggy clothes and did n't make much of an effort with myself			0
' the doctor said i needed an operation as the valves in my veins did n't work properly			1
' but he said i would have to lose at least two stone before they could perform the operation			2
how could i let myself get so big that it was too risky for me to have an operation ? ' i felt a deep sense of shame			0
' surgery is more risky for overweight and obese people			2
research has shown that obese patients have a significantly higher risk of complications after surgery , such as heart attack , wound infection , nerve injury , and urinary tract infections			0
being overweight also makes varicose veins worse as the extra weight puts more pressure on them			1
this means they have to work harder to send the blood back to the heart			0
mrs @entity4 was also suffering from severe varicose veins all over her legs and was desperate to get them removed as they were so painful and unsightly she says it was being told she was too overweight to have surgery that finally gave her a reason to lose weight this can put increased pressure on the valves , making them more prone to leaking			1

in two years she lost 9st , dropping from a size 22 to a size 10			1

' having the operation and getting my legs sorted was my goal			0
' instead of snacking on crisps and chocolates , i switched to fruit and yoghurts			0
' she also learned to cook all her favourite meals by replacing some of the ingredients with low - fat alternatives			2
by the time she had reached the top of the @entity100 waiting list , she had lost an impressive 6st			0
looking back , mrs @entity4 said she felt a ' deep sense of shame ' over her size			1

and three years on , she is now a size 10			1
