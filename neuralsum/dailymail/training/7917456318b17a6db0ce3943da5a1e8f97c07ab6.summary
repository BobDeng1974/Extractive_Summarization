president @entity0 is losing the war of words when it comes to radical @entity4 , experts warn , and he may want to abandon his campaign to separate terrorists in the @entity8 from their religion			1
@entity0 has been adamant that the religion of militants affiliated with @entity12 is irrelevant even as other world leaders have labeled them @entity4 extremists			1
bombarded by criticism , the @entity16 president dedicated speeches at the @entity20 counter-terrorism summit on wednesday and thursday to defending his administration 's stance			1
but even the name of 1600 @entity24 's confab - the @entity25 - suggests the militants are more than just terrorists - they 're religious ' extremists , ' @entity0 's critics say , and it 's ' self - deception ' to pretend otherwise			1
he again tried to explain his administration 's stance on violent extremism in his remarks ' @entity0 ’s reaching a point where he may have to ditch this almost scholastic position , ' @entity35 , chairman of @entity4 studies at @entity37 , told the @entity40			1
' he sounds like a distinguished professor in the ivory tower , and he may have to come down into the hurly - burly of politics , ' @entity35 warned			0
@entity45 , deputy director of speech writing for president @entity47 , told the @entity40 that part of what @entity0 is facing is ' a semantic battle , but it ’s a semantic battle that goes to deeper issues			1
' ' self - deception is not a good idea in politics or international affairs			1
we ’re lying to ourselves , and the world knows it , ' @entity45 , now a senior fellow at the @entity57 , added			0
former @entity62 mayor @entity61 on wednesday appeared to question @entity0 's patriotism over the matter			1
' i do not believe , and i know this is a horrible thing to say , but i do not believe that the president loves @entity16 , ' @entity61 said during a dinner for conservatives at @entity70 in @entity71 , according to @entity72			2
' he does n’t love you			0
and he does n’t love me			0
he was n’t brought up the way you were brought up and i was brought up through love of this country			0
' @entity61 , a 2008 candidate for the @entity78 nomination to the presidency , said @entity0 has ' to be able to criticize @entity4 for the parts of @entity4 that are wrong			1
' referring to remarks @entity0 made at a prayer breakfast several weeks ago , he charged , ' you criticize @entity84 for the part of @entity84 that is wrong			1
' ' i ’m not sure how wrong the @entity87 are , ' @entity61 mused			1
' @entity87 were kind of an equal battle between two groups of barbarians			0
the @entity92 and the crusading barbarians			0
' what the hell ? what ’s wrong with this man that he ca n’t stand up and say there ’s a part of @entity4 that ’s sick ? ' he asked			1
@entity61 backtracked on thursday morning and said he is ' not questioning [ @entity0 's ] patriotism			1
' ' he ’s a patriot , i ’m sure , ' @entity61 said on @entity102			1
' what i ’m saying is , in his rhetoric , i very rarely hear the things that i used to hear @entity106 say , the things that i used to hear @entity107 say about how much he loves @entity16			0
' but he stuck to his guns on the need for @entity0 to ' connect the dots ' when it comes to radicals and @entity113			2
' if you refuse to say that there are extremist members of the @entity4 religion , well then , it sounds like you ’re living on @entity119 , ' he said			2
on @entity122 wednesday night @entity121 sen. @entity120 blasted @entity0 as an ' apologist for radical @entity4 terrorists			1
' @entity120 accused the administration of having a ' false moral relativism ' and invoked @entity0 's prayer breakfast speech			1
' now last i checked , the @entity87 began a millennia ago , and i do n’t think it ’s too much to ask the president to stay in the current millennium , ' @entity120 said , per @entity72			0
the freshman senator and probable @entity78 presidential candidate said @entity0 should look to @entity135 president @entity134 , a @entity92 who has spoken out against violent fundamentalists associated with his religion , as a model			2
' why do n’t we see the president of the @entity16 demonstrating that same courage just to speak the truth about the face of evil we ’re facing right now ? ' @entity120 asked			0
a demonstrator stands in front of the @entity20 during the @entity20 counter-terror summit on wednesday holding a sign criticizing president @entity0 for his refusal to call label violent extremists by their religion the president spent the better part of a 30 minute speech on wednesday explaining that , in his administration 's view , it only legitimizes @entity161 and @entity12 to acknowledge their religious affiliation			1
' they try to portray themselves as religious leaders - holy warriors in defense of @entity4 , ' he said			2
that 's why @entity12 wants to be called the ' @entity169			0
' furthermore , ' they propagate the notion that @entity16 - and the @entity172 , generally - is at war with @entity4			2
that ’s how they recruit			0
that ’s how they try to radicalize young people , ' @entity0 asserted			2
' we must never accept the premise that they put forward , because it is a lie			0
nor should we grant these terrorists the religious legitimacy that they seek			0
they are not religious leaders -- they ’re terrorists , ' he said to applause			0
' and we are not at war with @entity4			0
we are at war with people who have perverted @entity4			0
' @entity0 dug in his heels in remarks at the summit on thursday , saying the world can not give in to terrorists ' especially their attempt to use @entity4 to justify their violence			1
' ' these terrorists are desperate for legitimacy , and all of us have a responsibility to refute the notion that groups like @entity202 somehow represent @entity4 , ' @entity0 said during a speech at the @entity30			1
' because that is a falsehood that embraces the terrorist narrative			0
' @entity0 chastised the media for not portraying @entity92 in a more positive light			0
because many @entity16 do n't personally know a muslim , they go off what they see in the news , he contended			0
and ' given the existing news cycle , that can give a very distorted impression			0
' ' a lot of the bad , ' he said , ' like terrorists who claim to speak for @entity4 , that 's absorbed by the population , and not enough of the good			2
muslim - american @entity220 , left , joins a group of protesters gathered in front of the @entity20 on wednesday during a rally to bring awareness of how the @entity20 's @entity228 summit and measures single out @entity92 , regardless of whether it calls militants radical @entity232 even as the president has been hit from the right for not drawing a strong enough time between @entity12 and @entity113 , he has also been hit from @entity92 communities over summit speakers ' focus on acts of terror committed by groups with roots in @entity4			1
a group of @entity92 - @entity16 protested outside the @entity20 on wednesday in the bitter cold to bring awareness to their argument - that the @entity0 administration is unfairly singling out @entity92 in its fight against @entity12			1
the @entity20 admitted on wednesday that it was ' very mindful ' of the fact that a ' particularly virulent strain of extremist ideology has tried to insert itself in the @entity92 community			2
' ' there ’s no question about that , ' @entity20 press secretary @entity254 said			2
' that 's true in the @entity16 ; that 's true in other places around the world			0
and that will be the subject of extensive discussion at the summit			0
' @entity0 said thursday that the coalition against @entity12 must also acknowledge that radicals are ' deliberately targeting their propaganda ' at @entity92 communities , particularly young people of that faith			1
@entity92 need to refute the notion ' that we are the cause of every ill in the @entity8 , ' @entity0 argued , because that narrative has also become a foundation for @entity12 to try to justify its violence			2

@entity0 dedicated speeches at the @entity20 counter-terrorism summit on wednesday and thursday to defending his administration 's stance
@entity0 's critics say it 's ' self - deception ' to push the narrative that radicals ' religion does n't matter
