@entity1 's message was clear			1
‘ if we sold @entity11 we might as well go home ’ was his assessment after the striker fired @entity4 to another win with the sort of hat - trick which will have @entity9 manager @entity8 taking notice			1
@entity1 , the @entity4 boss , is aware bigger clubs will come knocking when the january transfer window opens			1
with 18 months left on @entity18 ’s contract , @entity16 owner @entity15 knows they must tie him down — and sharpish			2
that need is even more pressing after he dragged his side to what had looked an impossible win after @entity24 took a two - goal lead through @entity26 and @entity27			1
following his hat - trick against @entity24 @entity11 is the top @entity30 goal scorer in the @entity31 @entity4 's in - form striker @entity18 scores a penalty for the hosts to halve their deficit against the @entity24 @entity11 headed in his side 's winner three minutes from the end of normal time to seal the win and his hat - trick @entity42 was delighted to see @entity43 give a penalty for @entity45 tugging @entity47 ’s shirt in the box			1
we have been campaigning for several weeks to rid the game of this cheating			0
@entity18 is the top @entity30 goalscorer in the @entity31 — only @entity53 and @entity54 have more than his 11 — and he has earned @entity4 a stunning 13 points			1

‘ he ’s a goalscorer			0
he ’s got a great attitude , ’ added @entity1			2
‘ there is no side to him			0
he ai n’t lairy — he ’s a lovely boy who ’s been to work for a living			0
’ @entity11 ’s story is one to inspire young footballers scratching around in non-league			2
it can be done through hard graft , if you have the talent			0
for this 25 - year - old , the rise might have happened sooner			0
@entity81 is an old friend of @entity1 and urged the manager to sign him when at @entity83			2
manager @entity1 said that his free - scoring striker will now be looking to reach 20 goals this season @entity4 striker @entity11 poses with the match ball after his hat - trick against @entity24 at @entity88 @entity1 admitted he scoffed when ‘ @entity93 ’ said his grandson , a striker with @entity90 , would do a job in the top flight , but who ’s laughing now ? an @entity9 call could well be on the way			1
‘ it ’s a knack — he ’s in the right place at the right time , ’ added @entity1			2
‘ if you score 20 goals in the championship this year you ’ll score in the @entity31			1
’ they ’ve known each other for two decades but @entity1 scoffed when ‘ @entity93 ’ said his grandson would do a job in the top flight when finding the net at @entity90			0
who ’s laughing now ? an @entity9 call could very well be on its way			0
‘ goalscorers find a yard of space			0
it ’s a knack - he ’s in the right place at the right time , ’ @entity1 added			1
‘ if you score 20 goals in the championship this year you ’ll score in the @entity31			1
