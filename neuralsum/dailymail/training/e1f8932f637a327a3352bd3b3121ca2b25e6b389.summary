doctors have refused to operate on a man who has a fork stuck in his throat after swallowing it for a bet it was only when questioned by doctors and he was confronted with the x-ray images that the embarrassed man admitted he had taken part in a bet with friends to prove how tough he was			2
and incredibly , doctors who had little tolerance for the foolish prank told the man they did not have time to remove it , and ordered him to wait and see if it came out the natural way			2
@entity8 said : ' i had been drinking and i bet with my friend that i could swallow the fork without getting hurt			1
@entity8 , 25 , complained to doctors of pain and an uncomfortable feeling when he swallowed , but neglected to mention that he had also swallowed a fork earlier in the day ' i put the fork in my mouth and managed to swallow it			1
' at first it did n't hurt , but after some minutes i experienced intense pain that just got worse , and i was forced to go to hospital			0
' luckily for @entity8 , the fork was not disturbing his airway or threatening any vital organs and at the moment does not need an emergency operation			1
he said : ' i was discharged and told i should wait and see if the fork will take its natural course and make its way through my body and leave the natural way			0
' but i have to come back in a few days to see if the fork has moved			0
if it reaches my stomach and looks like it could pierce the lining i will need an operation			0
' i realise now it was a very stupid thing to do			0
i do n't think i will be taking part in any bets for a while			0
