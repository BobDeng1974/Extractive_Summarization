senators plan to hold an initial vote thursday to begin debating gun legislation			0
@entity24 says there is a lot of work remaining to enact gun control measures , including getting them through the @entity19 - controlled @entity53			2
he 's calling on senators not to block consideration of the bill and for @entity57 to stay engaged			2
senators @entity9 and @entity18 said their accord would help keep firearms from criminals and the mentally ill. subjecting more firearms purchases to federal background checks has been the chief goal of @entity24 and gun control supporters , who promote the system as a way to prevent criminals and other potentially dangerous people from getting the weapons			1
@entity71 : @entity74 and @entity75 , parents of slain @entity8 , hold hands while meeting with the senator @entity78 and @entity79 ( left ) , who lost their six - year - old son @entity80 in the shooting			2
@entity74 , father of slain @entity8 ( right ) deal : senators @entity9 ( left ) and @entity18 ( right ) proposed the deal on background checks for firearm purchases even so , the ultimate fate of gun legislation remains unclear , clouded by opposition from the @entity90 ( @entity90 ) and many @entity19 and moderate @entity91 in the @entity93 - led @entity92 and the @entity19 - run @entity53			1
the @entity90 said wednesday the group is unequivocally opposed to the plan and threatened to punish lawmakers in its ratings system			1
' expanding background checks , at gun shows or elsewhere , will not reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools , ' top @entity90 lobbyist @entity99 wrote in a letter sent to senators wednesday night			1
' given the importance of these issues , votes on all anti-gun amendments or proposals will be considered in @entity90 's future candidate evaluations			2
' the agreement between two of the most conservative members of each party was expected to make it even likelier that the @entity92 's initial vote thursday to begin debating gun legislation will succeed , despite an effort by conservatives to block consideration of the measure			0
the proposal by sens. @entity9 and @entity18 would expand background checks to cover all sales at gun shows and over the @entity129			1
those background checks would have to be accompanied by records proving to law enforcement officials they took @entity134 would also exempt gun sales and transfers between friends and acquaintances without the help of an online intermediary			1
' truly the events at @entity15 changed us all , ' said @entity9 , referring to the @entity16 town where 20 first - graders and six educators were shot down in december , launching the country into renewed debate over gun violence			1
' @entity57 on both sides of the debate can and must find common ground			0
' ' i do n't consider criminal background checks to be gun control , ' said @entity18			1
' i think it 's just common sense			0
' the administration was continuing its effort to pressure @entity159 on gun control on wednesday as first lady @entity161 planned to visit a high school in @entity163 , the @entity165 ' hometown , where authorities say 29 current or former students have been shot in the past year			0
currently , the background check system covers sales only by licensed gun dealers			2
the compromise would apply the system to all commercial sales , such as transactions at gun shows and online			2
the sales would have to be channeled through licensed firearms dealers , who would have to keep records of the transactions			0
private transactions that are not for profit , such as those between relatives , would be exempt from background checks			1
the @entity24 administration has continued its efforts to pressure republicans in restricting firearms , with @entity189 and attorney general @entity190 speaking at the @entity53 tuesday joined by law enforcement officials sen. @entity192 , @entity193 , who led an earlier unsuccessful effort to strike a bipartisan background check deal , is backing the compromise after changes were made from an initial version of the deal between @entity9 and @entity18 , according to a @entity92 aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe details of the talks			1
the changes included eliminating language that would have required states to recognize permits to carry concealed weapons issued by other states and eliminating language that would have limited background checks to sellers who sell at least five guns annually , said the aide			1
some republicans might vote to begin debate on the legislation but eventually oppose the measure on final passage			0
other parts of @entity24 's gun effort already seem likely to face defeat , including proposed bans on assault weapons and high - capacity ammunition magazines			2
subjecting more firearms purchases to federal background checks has been the chief goal of @entity24 and gun control supporters the gun legislation @entity231 wants the @entity92 to debate would extend the background check requirement to nearly all gun sales			1
@entity231 would try to replace that language with the @entity9 - @entity18 compromise once debate begins , a move that would require a vote			1
the overall gun bill also tightens federal laws against illegal gun sales and slightly increases federal aid for school safety			2
thirteen conservatives have signed a letter saying they will block consideration of the measure , and @entity92 minority leader @entity248 , @entity249 , said he will back that move			0
that will force @entity91 to round up 60 votes to overcome the conservatives			0
at least eight @entity19 have said they want to begin debate or have indicated a willingness to consider it , a number that would be expected to grow if the background check agreement proves successful			0
some moderate @entity91 were remaining noncommittal and could oppose opening the gun debate			0
there are 53 @entity91 and two independents who lean @entity93			0
amid the maneuvering , relatives of some @entity15 victims are lobbying to support gun curbs			2
and @entity24 has been calling senators from both parties to push for the gun bill			0
' people should listen to what we have to say and move the debate forward , ' said @entity74 , who lost his 7 - year - old son , @entity272			0
' it 's not just about our tragedy			0
lots of kids are killed every day in this nation			0
we have to help lead the change			0
