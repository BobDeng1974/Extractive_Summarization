ride - hailing app uber is yet again being accused of deploying a dirty guerrilla war to control the car - on - demand market , using dozens of staffers to book and cancel rides with competing service @entity5 to tie up the company 's servers			1
@entity5 — whose drivers sport iconic pink mustaches on their cars — claims that as many as @entity14 employees have booked 5,560 rides through its app since october , @entity9 reported			1
then , once a driver would approach the pick - up spot , the ride would be mysteriously canceled			2
@entity5 says that the bait and switch creates a backlog in its system , making it seem that cars are booked up and the service is slower than its competitors			1
it also causes its drivers to waste time and money on gas for bogus rides			0
@entity34 : car - hailing service @entity5 , which is known for its iconic pink mustaches , says its main competitor , @entity39 , is employing shady tactics to keep control of the car - on - demand market one rider alone canceled some 300 rides between may 26 and june 10 , according to data released by the company			1
the user had a total of 21 accounts that combined canceled a whopping 1,524 rides			0
another user had 14 accounts and nearly 700 cancellations			0
' it 's unfortunate for affected community members that they have used these tactics , as it wastes a driver 's time and impacts the next passenger waiting for that driver , ' @entity5 spokeswoman @entity55 told @entity9			2
@entity5 say that in the few occasions when these rides were completed , they were often short and served only as a recruitment pitch to lure its drivers over to @entity39			1
yet @entity14 , which has been accused of similarly shady tactics before , claim it is not so			0
in a rebuttal on tuesday , the company said @entity5 's claims are ' baseless and simply untrue			1
' ' furthermore @entity5 ’s own drivers and employees , including one of @entity5 ’s founders , have canceled 12,900 trips on @entity39 , ' the company said in a statement to @entity82			1
' but instead of providing the long list of questionable tactics that @entity5 has used over the years , we are focusing on building and maintaining the best platform for both consumers and drivers			2
' guerrilla wars : @entity39 is accused of once again of booking services with competitors and canceling right away , slowing down the company 's competition this is not the first time @entity39 is accused of shaking down the competition			2
in january , the ceo of a similar car - hailing app , @entity100 , accused a least a dozen uber employees of ordering more than 100 rides over the span of three days and then canceling them right before pick - up , @entity82 reported			1
then a few days later , ceo @entity105 charged , @entity39 would contact @entity100 drivers and offer them money to switch over			0
@entity100 , which launched in @entity110 in 2013 , was supposed to be a more affordable option to the city 's black car offerings			0
some drivers say that @entity14 employees often book short trips just to try to convince them to switch over from @entity5 uber spokesman @entity117 admitted to @entity82 that its ' local teams can be pretty determined when spreading the word about @entity39 and how our platform opens up new economic opportunities for drivers			1
' ' it was likely too aggressive a sales tactic and we regret the team ’s approach to outreach of these drivers , ' @entity39 said in a statement to the tech website			0
but the company denied that its cancellations had caused any delays of loss of business for @entity100 , and insisted it had paid cancellation fees for all the rides			0
earlier this month , several @entity14 drivers told @entity9 that the company warned its drivers they were ' forbidden ' to work for @entity5 , even invoking a non-existent rule by @entity110 's @entity144 as an explanation			0
a spokesman for the commission said there are no rules proscribing affiliation with both companies .			0
