by @entity0 ethnic minorities should be encouraged to integrate into society rather than living in neighbourhoods with people from their own countries because it makes them ' feel more @entity7 ' , a study has shown			1
researchers from @entity9 and the @entity10 have found that minorities living in mixed areas were five per cent likely to identify with being @entity7 than those who did n't			1
people who lived separately from their own ethnicity were also just as likely to take part in community activities , help out their neighbours and trust those they lived with as those who segregated themselves			1
a study has found that minorities who live separated from their own ethnicity are more likely ' to feel ' @entity7 , and than more integration in @entity7 should be encouraged the study of 4,391 people , 3,582 of which came from ethnic minorities found that , for white @entity7 , being poor was a bigger factor in breaking down trust between neighbours than race			1
' diversity is really good for minority members in @entity7 , ' the report 's co-author , @entity31 , said			2
' if they live in diverse scenarios they identify more with @entity7			2
contact is good because they do n't create reactive identities			0
' the report echoes comments by @entity40 , who said that he was concerned by foreign minorities seeking to ' create their own country in @entity7 ' the paper , published in @entity45 , reverses years of study on the topic , with previous studies suggesting that ethnic mixing made people less trusting and lowered levels of community spirit			1
in conclusion , the report said : ' if anything , diversity should be encouraged to cement the integration progress of migrants			2
' the conclusion echoes statements by former @entity61 chairman @entity40 , who has criticised those who ' recreate their own country in @entity7 '			0
speaking to @entity64 in 2013 , he said : ' the problem that is caused in our cities is caused by immigrants from the third world who have got no intention of integrating here			0
' they are people who left their country , came here and are trying to recreate their country in our country			0
' we are building not so much a multi-racial society or a multi-cultural society , we are building separate societies which really do n't have much to do with each other			0
' @entity81 has also previously said that young immigrants should be taught to speak @entity83 and warned that some minorities are now more segregated from the rest of the country than their parents .			0

report shows that integration has a *positive* *effect* on minorities
people living apart from their own ethnicity are just as likely to trust neighbours and help other people as those who segregate themselves
previously it was *thought* integration had a *negative* *impact* on trust
more integration in @entity7 ' should be encouraged ' , say researchers
