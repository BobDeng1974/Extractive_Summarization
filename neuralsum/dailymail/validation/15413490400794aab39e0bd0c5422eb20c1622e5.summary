a tribunal hearing has found a midwife failed in her duty of care to a teenage mother who she told to ' keep her legs together ' after the young mum suffered a vaginal tear while giving birth			1
@entity10 's @entity9 also heard community nurse @entity11 showed up six minutes after the baby was born at her patient 's house on january 15 , 2012			1
she did this despite receiving five phone calls in one hour from the mother who described herself to be in ' excruciating pain '			1
a @entity10 @entity9 found a midwife did not give appropriate care to a teenage mother after she suffered a vaginal tear while giving birth at one point , ms @entity11 dismissed the increasingly urgent calls from the woman giving birth , her husband and the womon 's mother by saying ' teenage mothers sometimes panic when labour starts , ' the tribunal wrote in its judgement			2
the patient - only known in tribunal documents as ' @entity38 ' - gave birth to her baby ' on her hands and knees in the bathroom '			1
@entity44 did not bring her scissors to cut the umbilical cord and instead had to use kitchen scissors found by the teenager 's partner , mr @entity48 after examining ms b 's perineum - the area between vagina and anus - @entity44 told the mother there was a tear			1
it was a home birth and the midwife arrived late despite receiving five phone calls in one hour from the mother who described herself to be in ' excruciating pain ' the teenage mother gave birth to her baby ' on her hands and knees in the bathroom ' she said the tear was not a bad one , referring to it as only a ' tiny tear '			1
@entity44 looked at her patient 's perineum again and then advised ms b to be ' ladylike ' , and to keep her legs together and change her pads on a regular basis			2
but tribunal documents say ms @entity38 had to be later admitted to hospital			1
the midwife also had not told the new parents how to properly care for the wound , which was at risk of infection			0
tribunal documents said ms b only went to hospital weeks later when the midwife should have had her admitted at the time in the weeks after the pregnancy , ms @entity38 was in so much pain in her perineum that she could barely walk			1
when ms @entity38 took a step she could feel the tear pull open , and found it very painful when urinating			2
she told the defendant that she had tried to make a funnel to prevent the urine from touching the tear , and said that she could not bear the pain			0
ms @entity38 became so desperate she even tied her thighs together with her dressing gown cord so that she would not pull the wound open when she walked			2
the defendant laughed at ms b 's use of the dressing gown cord , which caused ms b to feel disparaged			0
the mother was found to have experienced a second degree vaginal tear that she was successfully treated for at @entity102 the defendant checked the tear and told ms b that the tear was ' healing fine '			0
but ms b still told the defendant that she was in a lot of pain			0
