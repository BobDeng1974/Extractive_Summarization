the average @entity1 is 20 pounds heavier today then they were in the 1990s , a new report shows			1

for men , it is now 181 pounds ( up from 177 pounds ) , and for women , it is now 138 pounds ( up from 137 ) , according to the report			0
researchers say this means that not only do men and women report that they weigh more today versus 20 years ago , but they are also getting further away from their ideal weight			0

getting fatter : the poll found that @entity1 men , on average , say they weigh 196 pounds - nearly 20 pounds heavier than reported in 1990 these results are based on @entity4 's annual @entity32 survey , conducted nov. 3 - 6			2
@entity4 has asked @entity1 to say how much they weigh yearly since 2001 and in 1990 and 1999			2

expanding waistlines : the poll found that average @entity1 women say they weigh 160 pounds - nearly 20 pounds higher than 20 years ago however , this figure far exceeds the percentage of @entity1 who personally describe themselves as overweight - just 39 per cent - with the majority ( 56 per cent ) saying their weight is ' about right , ' as previous polls in the past 20 years have also shown			1
researchers say the disconnect between the percentage who are over their ideal weight and the percentage who say they are overweight may come from @entity1 ' own reluctance to describe themselves using such a term			1
additionally , @entity4 's data found that roughly one in four @entity1 are between one and 10 pounds over their ideal weight , many of whom may be more inclined to view their weight as ' about right ' than as ' overweight '			1
results for this @entity4 poll are based on telephone interviews conducted between november 3 and 6 with a random sample of 1,012 adults , aged 18 and older , living in all @entity1 states , selected using random sampling .			0
