@entity0 has slammed @entity2 's @entity1 showing this season - insisting that his former club should be challenging for the title due to the amount of money they spent in the summer			1
@entity2 outlaid over £ 150m on the combined talents of new recruits such as @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 in the previous transfer window as the @entity13 sought to rebuild on a disastrous campaign where they finished seventh			1
however , despite the vast figures spent under new boss @entity20 , the @entity17 ' fundamental problems of last term still exist as they trail 12 points behind table - toppers @entity22 in fourth place			1
@entity0 has branded @entity2 's season as ' bad ' with the club currently fourth in the league @entity2 spent over £ 150million on players this summer but @entity20 's side are 12 points from the title @entity9 ( right ) was signed for a @entity33 club - record fee of £ 60m from @entity34 in august and @entity0 is adamant that securing just a top four spot should be deemed as a bad season for @entity2 due to the vast investment in the squad			1
‘ people keep saying they are going to get ( a ) top four ( finish ) and that was the aim , that is ( the ) absolute bare minimum			0
top four for @entity2 ? , ' he told @entity44 's @entity43			2
' after spending £ 150 million and having the players they have and the stadium – they should be first , second , third			2
@entity49 should be a bad season			0
' how they are accepting that they are not challenging for the title having spent that money on those calibre of players			0
it ’s not a good season			0
’ @entity2 's 2 - 0 win at @entity59 on saturday moved them on to 40 points after 22 games this season			1
with the scoreline goalless at half - time the @entity17 ' travelling supporters deplored for a change of @entity68 's preferred 3 - 5 - 2 formation to a more conventional 4 - 4 - 2 style , which the @entity70 eventually heeded			2
@entity68 's choice of formation and tactics have been accused of hindering @entity2 's hitherto , swashbuckling traditional brand of football and @entity0 concurs that the club are n't creating the amount of chances that they use to in the past			1
@entity2 fans , pictured celebrating , were screaming ‘ four - four - two ’ during the side 's initial struggles at @entity59 ‘ i do n’t think any of the strikers are performing			1
@entity88 has gone quiet , he ’s scored the odd goal but he ’s not the player he was over the past few years , ' he added			0
' i do n’t necessarily blame the strikers as @entity2 are n’t creating loads and loads of chances			2
' they are not functioning as a team and if you do n’t function as a team , and your strikers and midfielders are n’t working hard then you ’ll concede goals – it ’s not just about the defence			0
if you ’re not playing well throughout the team you wo n’t score enough goals as the strikers are n’t getting enough chances			0
’ ‘ the likes of @entity108 and @entity109 need to start doing more			0
@entity108 ’s had a half decent season but i would n’t say i ’m his biggest fan			0
@entity111 has been really good and done well when he ’s played wing back , he ’s unlucky not to get in the team but it ’s not very balanced at the moment			0
’ @entity68 's men travel to @entity117 in the @entity119 fourth round on friday night , before hosting @entity120 at home in the @entity1 on january 31			1
@entity0 also believes @entity2 striker @entity88 ( front ) is n't the player he once was a few years ago @entity0 was speaking on @entity43 , @entity44 ’s football debate and news round - up show .			1
