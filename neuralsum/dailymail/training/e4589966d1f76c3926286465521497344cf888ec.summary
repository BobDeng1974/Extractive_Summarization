by @entity0 violent conflicts , organised crime and child labour are being driven by declines in wildlife population			1
this is according to a recent report which highlights how losses of food and employment from wildlife are creating political instability			2
the research also suggests that falling animal populations could be connected to an increase in human trafficking as criminal groups rely on slave labour , often children , to meet the need for increased manpower			1
study compared wildlife poaching to the drug trade , suggesting that huge profits from trafficking luxury wildlife goods , such as elephant tusks and rhino horns , have attracted guerilla groups and crime syndicates worldwide ‘ this paper is about recognising wildlife decline as a source of social conflict rather than a symptom , ' said @entity36 , professor of ecology at @entity38 , who led the study			1
‘ billions of people rely directly and indirectly on wild sources of meat for income and sustenance , and this resource is declining			0
‘ it 's not surprising that the loss of this critical piece of human livelihoods has huge social consequences			1
‘ yet , both conservation and political science have generally overlooked these fundamental connections			0
’ the group pointed to the @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 as groups known to use wildlife poaching to fund terrorist attacks			0

labourers – many of whom are children – are often sold to fishing boats and forced to work 18 - 20 hour days at sea for years without pay , it said			0
the scientists claim that falling animal populations could be connected to an increase in human trafficking			1
they argue that criminal groups rely on slave labour , often children , to meet the need for increased manpower			1
they also connected the rise of piracy and maritime violence in @entity88 to battles over fishing rights			1
they believe what began as an effort to repel foreign vessels illegally trawling through @entity88 waters escalated into hijacking fishing – and then non-fishing – vessels for ransom			2
the study compared wildlife poaching to the drug trade , suggesting that huge profits from trafficking luxury wildlife goods have attracted crime syndicates worldwide			2
‘ impoverished families are relying upon these resources for their livelihoods , so we ca n't apply economic models that prescribe increases in prices or reduced demand as supplies become scarce , ' said professor @entity36			0
' instead , as more labour is needed to capture scarce wild animals and fish , hunters and fishers use children as a source of cheap labour			2
‘ hundreds of thousands of impoverished families are selling their kids to work in harsh conditions			0

' surprisingly few people recognise that competition for fish stocks led to the birth of @entity88 piracy , ' said professor @entity36			2
' for @entity88 fishermen , and for hundreds of millions of others , fish and wildlife were their only source of livelihood , so when that was threatened by international fishing fleets , drastic measures were taken			1

pictured is a ' skiff ' , a small boat frequently used by pirates , off the @entity88 coast ' the most important bit from this article , i think , is that we need to better understand the factors that underlie fish and wildlife declines from a local perspective , and that interdisciplinary approaches are likely the best option for facilitating this understanding , ' said @entity184 , a @entity185 associate professor of conservation criminology who was not part of the study			1
the authors give examples of local governments heading off social tension , such as the granting of exclusive rights to hunting and fishing grounds to locals in @entity196 , and the control of management zones in @entity199 to reduce poaching and improve the livelihoods of local populations			1
' this prescribed re-visioning of why we should conserve wildlife helps make clearer what the stakes are in this game , ' said @entity210 assistant professor @entity209			0
' losses of wildlife essentially pull the rug out from underneath societies that depend on these resources			0
we are not just losing species			0
‘ we are losing children , breaking apart communities , and fostering crime			0
this makes wildlife conservation a more important job than it ever has been			0

study says wildlife loss is source of social conflict rather than a symptom
falling animal populations are connected to increase in human trafficking
this is because criminals rely on slave labour to meet need for manpower
authors connect the rise of piracy in @entity88 to battles over fishing rights
they believe scientists should team up with politicians to tackle problem
