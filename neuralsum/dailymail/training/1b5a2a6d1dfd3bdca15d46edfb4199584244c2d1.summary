by @entity0 published : 07:47 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 12:42 est , 22 march 2013 six of the world 's seven billion people have mobile phones - but only 4.5 billion have a toilet , according to a @entity8 report			1
the shocking statistic has prompted the international organisation to launch a global campaign to improve sanitation for the 2.5 billion people whose health is at risk			1
@entity8 deputy secretary - general @entity16 called their plight ' a silent disaster ' that reflects the extreme poverty and huge inequalities in the world today			0
risk : open defecation in developing countries such as @entity26 reflects the huge inequalities in the world , the @entity8 says @entity16 told a press conference that the issue must be addressed immediately for the world to meet the @entity8 goal of halving the proportion of people without access to sanitation by the end of 2015			1
world leaders set a series of @entity40 to combat poverty at a summit in 2000 , and @entity16 said the sanitation goal lags farthest behind			0
warning : the @entity8 deputy secretary - general @entity16 said the lack of sanitation for so many is a ' silent disaster ' while most people do n't want to talk about the problem , @entity16 said , ' it goes to the heart of ensuring good health , a clean environment and fundamental dignity for billions of people			0
' the @entity8 said action must include eliminating by 2025 the practice of open defecation , which perpetuates disease			2
the number of people resorting to open defecation has decreased by 271 million since 1990 , but it is still practiced by 1.1 billion people , or 15 percent of the world 's population , the @entity8 said			1
it is one of the main causes of diarrhea , which results in the death of more than 750,000 children under the age of five every year , the @entity8 said			0
@entity16 said 22 countries account for more than 80 percent of open defecation in the world			1
according to a @entity8 official , the countries are @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity26 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98			2
@entity26 alone accounts for 60 per cent of the number of people who practice open defecation			1
this stands in stark contrast to the rise of the mobile phone market in the fast - developing economy			2
there are now close to 1billion phones in @entity26 - a meteoric rise from just 45million in 2002			0
problem : the @entity8 says emergeing economies such as @entity78 , pictured , account for 80 per cent of open defecation around 14million people in @entity79 , pictured , do not have access to a toilet but there are an estimated 986million mobile phones registered despite the lack of sanitation , most people are able to afford a mobile phone with a wide range available for £ 10 or less and the price of calls reducing from 10p a minute to 2p a minute in the last decade			1
mobile phone retail and repair shops are now commonplace in cities throughout @entity26 and @entity127 now has its biggest factory in the world in @entity131			1
@entity133 , deputy executive director of the @entity8 children 's agency @entity134 , said at the present rate of progress , the @entity8 sanitation goal will be reached in 2075 instead of 2015 , which is unacceptable			0
the global economic gains from investing in sanitation and clean water are estimated at £ 170 billion per year , the @entity8 said			2
by contrast , poor sanitation affects economic growth , costing countries between 0.5 percent and 7.2 percent of their gdp			0
growth : @entity26 has almost 1billion mobile phones registered but only 30 per cent have proper sanitation the use of mobile phones in developing countries has skyrocketed in the last decade , with many not bothering to install landlines			1
but other necessities of daily living , such as improved sanitation , are yet to catch up			0
the @entity8 report says that 22 countries account for 80 per cent of open defecation around the world			1
these are the ten countries with the highest number of people living without proper sanitation			0
@entity26 - 626million people without proper sanitation - but 893million mobile phones			2
