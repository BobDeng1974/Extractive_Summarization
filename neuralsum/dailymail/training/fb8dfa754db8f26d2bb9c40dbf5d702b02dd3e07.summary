@entity3 must calm down about the @entity5 's demand for an extra £ 1.7billion , his new man in @entity2 has warned			1
lord @entity6 , @entity8 's new @entity7 commissioner , urged the prime minister to ' look at the facts ' to cool the ' political temperature '			1
mr @entity3 has warned the @entity5 's ' appalling ' behaviour has pushed @entity8 closer to leaving the @entity5 , accusing bureaucrats of ' thumping ' @entity8 with a bill which must be paid by december 1			1
@entity2 is to offer for @entity8 to pay the bill in instalments , something rejected by @entity18 today			1
lord @entity6 , @entity8 's new @entity7 commissioner , urged the prime minister to ' look at the facts ' to cool the ' political temperature ' over the row about the shock £ 1.7billion bill @entity8 is locked in intense negotiations with the @entity26 about the demand for an extra £ 1,7billion , which caught mr @entity3 off guard at a summit last month			1
the @entity26 used rules dating back to 1995 and found @entity8 's economy has grown faster than expected , so must pay a greater share to @entity2			1
to add insult to injury , @entity34 will receive a £ 790million rebate because its economy is struggling			0
bizarrely , @entity39 is also in line for a rebate while countries like @entity43 and @entity44 must pay more			0
mr @entity3 angrily insisted he will not bow to the demands , declaring : ' i am not paying that bill on december 1			0
if people think i am , they have got another thing coming			0
it is not going to happen			0
' but today @entity6 , who was appointed by mr @entity3 in the summer , issued a plea for calm and insisted it was time to look for a ' practical ' solution			2
he added that the question over @entity8 's membership of the @entity5 is at a ' lively stage ' and is a ' boil that needs to be lanced			1
lord @entity6 , the @entity5 commissioner for financial services , told @entity61 's today programme : ' it seems to me that this is one of those classic examples you get from time to time where something that a group of people think are technical matters suddenly , and in this case for perfectly understandable reasons , become highly political			1
' the sensible thing now is to try to calm the situation down , and to look at the facts , and to look at a practical solution to the challenges that various member states face			1
' he added : ' these things happen ... the political temperature goes up and then it goes down again			2
' lord @entity6 said his job means he is required to act in the interests of all 28 member states , not just @entity8			0
@entity8 faces by far the biggest surcharge and has been seeking allies among other @entity5 states for a rethink of the contributions			2
chancellor @entity93 will use a meeting in @entity2 tomorrow to call for a rethink , but is likely to face stiff resistance from states which gain , including @entity34 , which is in line for a billion euro ( £ 788.7 million ) rebate , and @entity39 , which stands to receive 779 million euro ( £ 614 million )			1
one idea which has emerged is that officials in @entity2 will allow @entity8 to pay the money in installments , without running up interest			1
but mr @entity3 's offical spokesman said : ' the right thing is to keep doing what we have been doing , which is to make very clearly our views around the unacceptability of the scale of the bill and to get on with the work we are doing with the @entity26 and other @entity5 finance ministers			1
' @entity8 has been told to pay £ 1.7billion by december 1 , on top of the £ 8billion - a - year it already pays			2
@entity34 , @entity39 and @entity116 are among those told they will get money back from @entity2 lord @entity6 said @entity2 needs to do a ' smaller number of bigger things better ' instead of ' intruding ' into areas of national life			0
he told the programme : ' my view is that on the back of a reform process @entity8 would want to choose to stay in the @entity5			2
' obviously that 's a choice for the people of @entity8 , there 's democratic process to go through if we have that referendum			0
but i think it is good to address that question , i think there is a boil that needs to be lanced			0
' he added : ' we have a tendency in @entity8 to think of all these issues as though they only affect @entity8 , @entity8 exceptionalism , if i can call it that			0
' the fact is , when i sit here and look across the @entity5 and what 's happening in other countries , many other countries have very similar debates			0
' prime minister @entity3 has refused to pay the £ 1.7billion bill by december 1 , accusing the @entity5 of ' appalling ' behaviour @entity153 , the new commission president , this week hit out the prime minister ’s behaviour			1
mr @entity153 criticised the leaders of @entity8 and @entity44 for making critical comments about the @entity5 after both countries were landed with huge cash demands			2
@entity160 , the @entity44 premier , was also highly critical of @entity5 civil servants after the meeting			0
speaking in the @entity163 yesterday , mr @entity153 said : ' i did n't like the way several prime ministers were behaving after the @entity167			0
' for a long period of time i 've taken notes and i was always comparing what is said in the room and what is said outside the room			0
and from time to time it happens that the notes are not coinciding			0
' mr @entity3 tried to block mr @entity153 , a former @entity176 and arch - federalist , from taking the senior @entity5 post			2
mr @entity153 described the way mr @entity3 was presenting the @entity5 cash demand issue as ' not correct '			1
' they are presented in a totally different way in parts of @entity8 public opinion , ' mr @entity153 said , pointing out that the rules of the @entity5 should be better respected			2
mr @entity160 had complained that the @entity5 was overtly bureaucratic			0
at one point he warned that he would make public the cost of @entity5 ' palaces ' in a row over @entity44 's budget projections			0
mr @entity153 responded : ' i have to tell my good friend @entity160 that i am not the chairman of a gang of bureaucrats ... i am the president of the @entity26 which is a political body			0
' @entity3 last night rejected an @entity5 ‘ pay - as - you - go ’ compromise over @entity8 ’s bill for £ 1.7billion			1
at a dinner in @entity203 , he warned his northern @entity7 counterparts that the budget demand was pushing @entity8 towards the exit door			2
it emerged last night that senior officials in @entity2 are suggesting @entity8 could be allowed to pay its bill – calculated after the @entity8 ’s economy was uprated – in chunks over the next year , rather than in full on december 1			1
interest payments of more than £ 40million a month would also be waived			0
last night , the prime minister argued the row was a ‘ prime example of where the @entity5 needs to respond to voters ’ concerns ’			1
mr @entity3 said the £ 1.7billion demand had triggered a 10 per cent poll swing to leaving the @entity5 ahead of his proposed referendum on membership should he win next year ’s election .			1
