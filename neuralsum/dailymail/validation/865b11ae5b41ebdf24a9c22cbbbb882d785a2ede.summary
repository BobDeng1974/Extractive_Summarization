one of the men expelled from @entity1 with @entity2 is a close associate of ‘ the @entity4 ’ , responsible for horrific videos of beheadings			1
@entity7 was with @entity9 national @entity8 when they were stopped at the airport in @entity12 in 2009			1
now @entity13 can reveal that @entity9 intelligence has linked @entity15 to @entity16 – the rapper whose role making videos for @entity19 has been likened to that of @entity22 propaganda chief @entity21			1
it is believed he may also have produced the sickening footage of @entity7 murdering @entity41 and @entity42 prisoners with a knife			2
@entity9 authorities have linked him to @entity15 , one of the most dangerous islamists on their radar , who they classify as ‘ prone to violence ’			2
although he claims to have turned his back on fanaticism , @entity8 is believed to have forged links with @entity53 terror group @entity52 , an @entity54 affiliate			0
when a @entity13 reporter spoke to @entity15 at his home in @entity57 about his links to jihadism , he said : ‘ i do n’t have anything to do with that any more			0
’ some time later , outside the door of his seedy fourth - floor flat , he appeared flanked by two heavies , who made it plain that it was time for our reporter to leave			0
but his denials conflict with information from @entity9 intelligence agencies which regard him as a ‘ person of interest ’ in the ongoing fight against @entity19			1
@entity16 , who was a rapper under the name @entity34 , has appeared in an is beheading video , holding up the severed head of a victim @entity7 was expelled from @entity1 with one of @entity16 's associates in 2009			1
@entity16 ( right ) has been likened to the @entity22 propaganda chief @entity21			1
@entity7 , @entity82 convert @entity8 and @entity83 were stopped by the @entity1 authorities at @entity12 airport as they arrived for what they had claimed was an innocent safari holiday			1
@entity7 ’s apologists have claimed the men ’s detention – ‘ on orders from @entity96 ’ – as the first step on his road to radicalisation			0
yet @entity13 has established that the supposedly strict @entity97 were held not because of their political affiliations , but due to their drunken and violent behaviour on a @entity102 @entity101 flight from @entity103 to @entity12 , according to the @entity1 government			2
@entity15 is connected with some of the vilest figures in the radical @entity82 network , most notably fellow convert @entity16			0
@entity9 intelligence sources say both men were radicalised by @entity109 , the @entity110 - born leader of banned @entity112 group @entity111			1
in september 2013 , @entity8 was stopped returning to @entity9 after a flight from @entity114			2
a search revealed a secret compartment in his jacket containing a false @entity119 driving licence and identity card			0
