@entity31 , mr @entity1 's then spin chief , can be seen in the background @entity9 fell out with @entity1 after the former prime minister sacked @entity34 for the second time in 2001			1

i met him first in 1992 i think			0
‘ who knew that he would become a great friend of @entity87 and would want to keep bombing people and would be so passionately interested in making money and live this strange life with the billionaire super-rich on yachts and private jets ? ‘ i mean , maybe someone more perceptive than i would have seen it , but i never saw that at the time , nor – knowing a lot of the people who know him very well – did they			0
‘ it ’s a cliche to say that most politicians go mad if they are in office for more than about six or seven years and they become a member of a club and you become quite disconnected from reality , and i think there were in @entity108 things we perhaps did n’t realise at the time – of narcissism , a messiah complex , that had merely accelerated this impulse in him			0

‘ @entity1 seemed to have suited his purposes and then he walked out and that was a slap in the face , i think , for parliament and the @entity18 people			2
