the views from the white cliffs of the @entity3 coast have remained unchanged for millions of years			2
but visitors to the @entity5 , drawn there for the unbroken vista of rolling hills and choppy seas , could soon be faced with the sight of scores of wind turbines towering above the waves			2
energy secretary @entity13 has approved a £ 2billion project to build 175 turbines nine miles out to sea , each standing nearly 700 feet tall			1
opponents , including the @entity19 and the @entity20 , say the view from landmarks such as @entity23 ( above ) and the @entity25 cliffs will be spoiled for ever he insists the @entity28 wind farm , set for completion in 2018 , is essential because it will power 450,000 homes with green energy			1
mr @entity13 , a @entity32 , said : ‘ this project is great news for @entity3 , providing green jobs as well as driving business opportunities right across the country in a sector with a clear roadmap for long - term growth			1
’ but opponents , including the @entity19 and the @entity20 , say the view from landmarks such as @entity23 and the @entity25 cliffs , and towns including @entity44 and @entity45 , will be spoiled for ever			1
depending on the terms of the contract that @entity53 developer @entity51 signs with the government , it can be expected to receive up to £ 200million a year in subsidies , critics say			0
@entity19 , which owns sections of the @entity3 coast , has formally objected to the project			1
in a letter to the government ’s planning inspectorate , the @entity19 said : ‘ the beauty of the coastline matters to the nation			2
‘ the impact of the proposal on the designated assets of the @entity20 and heritage coast , on the landscape and seascape character of the area , on important visual receptors and on key @entity19 sites is considered to be major			1
’ the decision was handled by mr @entity13 and his energy department because it is considered a major infrastructure project , providing a large chunk of the nation ’s electricity needs			1
@entity13 and his @entity32 colleagues are strong advocates of wind power , despite common objections from people who live near planned sites mr @entity13 and his @entity32 colleagues are strong advocates of wind power , despite common objections from people who live near planned sites			1
the same can not be said of certain members of his @entity91 partners			0
a report published by the @entity93 today reveals that @entity94 , the conservative secretary of state for communities and local government , has single - handedly slashed the number of on - shore wind farms and large solar arrays given planning permission in the last year			2
a year ago mr @entity94 announced he would personally oversee all wind and solar planning appeal cases			0
since then the number of planning approvals for solar and wind farms has fallen from 80 per cent to 60 per cent			0
mr @entity13 and mr @entity94 are known to disagree on their approach to renewable energy and the planning system - but at the moment each are confined by their own remit			2
the energy secretary has influence when a project is deemed to be a national infrastructure matter , while mr @entity94 can only intervene if an application is taken to appeal			1
in 2013 , @entity94 announced he would personally oversee all wind and solar planning appeal cases			0
@entity117 , senior energy campaigner at @entity93 , said : ‘ we applaud the government for taking action to stop renewable energy projects that would have a damaging effect on the countryside			0
‘ but without a clearer and more strategic approach to planning in the first place , we ’re relying on one minister to intervene and protect our landscapes			0
‘ planning policy must be further clarified to make sure that the need for renewable energy does not automatically override environmental protection and the wishes of local communities			0
‘ the current approach to planning renewable projects , that are needed to produce low - carbon energy , is chaotic and unsustainable			0
‘ with the pressure for renewable energy in the countryside only set to increase , we need to see further improvements in planning policy and incentives for brownfield and commercial sites			0
