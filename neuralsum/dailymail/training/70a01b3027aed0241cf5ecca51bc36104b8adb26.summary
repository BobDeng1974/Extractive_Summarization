guilty : @entity9 , right , listens to the closing arguments as the trial into the double murder of her children comes to a close on thursday sentenced : @entity9 cries and puts her head in her hands as the judge sends her to prison for life before sentencing her to life in prison , without parole , the judge said : ' [ it 's ] almost too much to comprehend what brings us here			1
' @entity9 and her family cried as the guilty verdict was read out			1
the prosecution had earlier claimed the murders had been planned because of anger at her family , and because her children were becoming ' mouthy '			1
the children 's father , @entity41 , said : ' today 's decision , for many reasons , gives my family a great sense of relief			1
' while this decision does n't bring my children back , it does give my family an opportunity to move forward			1

i accidentally shot the window then shot him			2
one in the side of the head and one in his mouth because he became so mouthy just like @entity10			2
' another entry , about her daughter , read : ' [ @entity84 ] walked up without [ @entity10 ] reacting , and shot her in the right temple			1
then shot her in the mouth , her sassy little mouth			2
' both sides had presented several mental health experts as witnesses during their trial , as the defense argued that @entity9 had been legally insane			1

plea : @entity9 , pictured being led into the courtroom on thursday , had tried to plead not guilty by reason of insanity , but a jury found she was sane at the time of the killings @entity111 suggested her motive was anger and resentment toward her husband , saying she intended him to come home and find his family dead			1
