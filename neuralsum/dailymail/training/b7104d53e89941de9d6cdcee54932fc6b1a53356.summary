whether prompted by a desire to keep up with those pert @entity3 sisters or simply by a resurgence in energy as her children move out of the sleepless phase of infancy , @entity0 has sharpened up her act			1
the attention - grabbing , skin - tight electric blue number by fashion ’s master of flattery , @entity16 , that she wore to last sunday ’s @entity17 at @entity18 showed off her @entity20 - honed figure and was particularly well - suited to her new role as patron of the @entity23			2
royal favourite : @entity0 , @entity0 ( right ) has her hat readjusted by the @entity26 days ago , in @entity28 ’s documentary @entity26 , she gave her first television interview since her wedding			1
the programme makers and the viewers — most of whom had never heard her voice — were impressed by her self - deprecating , warm , fluid manner			2
her accent was refreshingly unaffected , neither plummy nor estuary			0
as she jokingly spoke of her terror of @entity40 banquets , she said she had been copying the @entity26 ’s manner , seeking to emulate her elegant style and the way she never rushes when talking to people			1
whatever @entity0 has been striving to perfect — that polish in both appearance and attitude — it seems to be working			1
honed : @entity0 on @entity49 in skin tight @entity16 at @entity18 in @entity51 last month , the organisers of a fundraising dinner in aid of the @entity55 were stunned when she spoke for 20 minutes , knowledgeably and movingly on the subject , rather than uttering the usual brief platitudes favoured by most royals , including @entity59			1
it was astonishing and financially effective , said a trustee , photographer @entity61			0
apparently , she always does her homework			0
no wonder bright - eyed @entity0 is a great favourite of the @entity26			1
they share an interest in horses and military history , sometimes staying up late at @entity69 to discuss what they have read			1
the @entity26 respects her work ethic , the effort she puts into her engagements , and bringing up her children			1
she alone has managed to stay married to one of the @entity26 ’s children , and that child , @entity79 , as the baby , carries special status with his mother			1
there has been speculation that @entity0 might feel threatened by the @entity26 ’s fondness for the @entity59 , with whom the @entity82 has undertaken a few joint engagements to introduce her into her role			1
she would never do joint engagements with @entity0			1
but the @entity91 ’s gravitational pull is towards her mother , @entity93 , in @entity94 , and @entity95 at @entity96			0
while the @entity26 now enjoys good relations with @entity99 , that bond will never be as straightforward as the one she has with @entity0 , whose mother died in 2005			1
@entity0 has the advantage of proximity as the @entity104 pile , @entity105 , lies 11 miles from @entity69			1
as her children , @entity106 and @entity107 , @entity108 , are only nine and five , these relationships are as near as the @entity26 can get to enjoying a nuclear family			1
they ride together in @entity112 and drink cups of tea by the fire almost every weekend			0
the @entity26 always chooses @entity0 to sit next to her on the way to @entity117 on christmas day			1
she gave @entity0 the choice of furniture and pictures from her own collection when she revamped ten bedrooms at @entity123 , so there is now a tartan @entity126 room and another with a naval theme			1
the @entity26 has helped teach @entity0 ’s children to ride , and has advised her on the rehabilitation of her image			1
after all , a few years ago it certainly did n’t look as though @entity0 would become the @entity82 ’s pet or such a sought - after charity patron , let alone a fashion plate			1
stylish : @entity0 , @entity0 coming out of her shell , looking confident at a wedding in 2011 she was a @entity138 girl who featured in some toe - curling snaps of @entity140 pulling up her top when she worked at @entity142			1
she met @entity79 playing a publicity game of ‘ real ’ tennis , and eyebrows were raised when they married because there had been talk he was n’t the marrying kind			0
he designed her a strange necklace for a wedding present , and the bridesmaids and pages seemed to be in fancy dress as the last of the @entity154			0
@entity0 declared her desire to carry on working at @entity156 , the pr company she had set up with her partner @entity157			1
then , in 2001 , disaster struck			0
@entity0 ( and her partner ) was recorded by the @entity161 ’s notorious ‘ fake sheikh ’ being indiscreet about other royals and offering to use those royal connections for clients			1
she was so traumatised , one friend says , that she talked about leaving the country in tearful despair , believing she would be relegated to daughter - in - law non grata			1
the avowed career girl was forced to put aside her fantasy of being an entrepreneur as well as a royal			0
backed up and counselled by the @entity26 , she adopted a lower register of unglamorous , low - profile public engagements with the aim of starting a family			1
the royal wives : @entity0 , @entity0 , left , with @entity179 , @entity59 and @entity99 , @entity180 , right , last year but that did n’t go smoothly either			2
in 2001 , she suffered a life - threatening ectopic pregnancy , followed by months of @entity183			2
daughter @entity106 was born in 2003 several weeks early by emergency @entity184 , and it was reported at one point @entity79 was told he might have to choose between the survival of mother or child			0
but both flourished , although @entity106 had exotropia , a serious eye condition , which triggered her mother ’s interest in children with developmental difficulties			0
then , happily , a son arrived in 2007			0
by now , @entity156 had collapsed owing several creditors lots of money , though @entity0 had scaled back her involvement years before			2
and she had made a decision ; having been through such a struggle to have children , she would be a very hands - on mother			2
no surprise that many of her charities involve children ’s causes , and the enthusiasm she shows when meeting them is obviously genuine			0
she is said by one royal observer to have ‘ an almost @entity215 - like effect on people , a natural warmth and sweetness , whereas @entity79 can be so awkward ’			2
@entity79 apparently retains an antipathy to the media although @entity0 , arguably a far greater victim of its sting than he ever was , displays a likeable breeziness and lack of resentment in her attitude			2
both of the couple ’s children are now at a private prep school			0
the @entity232 have a nanny among other staff ( a housekeeper , two maids and a gardener as well as office personnel ) but early on agreed they would rarely go away at the same time			2
@entity0 often does the school run herself			2
last year , the @entity232 carried out two foreign tours for the @entity241 , to @entity242 — a politically sensitive mission given @entity245 ’s antipathy , which the @entity26 tellingly trusted them to carry off — and the @entity247			2
though that may sound like nice work , it was apparently far from a pool and cocktails job , consisting of two weeks of back - to - back engagements while away from their children			2
new to the family : @entity0 marrying @entity79 at @entity257 in @entity69 in 1999 as well as @entity20 classes with mothers from her children ’s school , sessions with a personal fitness trainer , running , riding and tennis keep @entity0 fit			1
she started displaying the results in a startlingly revamped wardrobe — her confidence obviously went through the roof — about two years ago			0
in her mid- 40s she acquired a taste for high fashion			0
she started sporting one - shouldered evening gowns , and daring figure - hugging evening dresses such as the one she wore to the @entity274 last summer			0
her teeth got whiter , her skin smoother , her hair blonder and more coiffed			0
hello ! readers voted her outfit — not @entity59 ’s — the most attractive at @entity281 ’ wedding			0
her hats seemed to get bigger and more ‘ look - at - me ’			0
if she was worried the @entity3 sisters were about to overshadow her , she certainly did something about it			0
she made sure the photographers could n’t ignore her			0
the fact she was a mother - of - two , energetic in her charity works and had been learning from the @entity26 ’s unhurried style made her look the model royal			1
and as we can see from her blue suit and endearing manner this week , she ’s not as bland as we all feared , either			0
of course , such rehabilitations never go as smoothly as one would like			0
even in recent months , @entity0 has had the odd hiccup			2
there was a furore over her acceptance of some dazzling suites of jewellery from the despotic state of @entity302 ; the @entity26 backed her in keeping them and it all fizzled out ( presumably she felt that if she had refused , there would have been a diplomatic incident )			2
old friends : @entity0 and the @entity26 back in 2001 even friends admit she has a temper — she was photographed last year shouting at her protection officer in the street for reasons unknown — and opinions are divided about whether she is really incredibly ‘ down to earth ’ and people - friendly , as most people say , or whether she can be a trifle grand when she thinks she can get away with it			1
but surely it ’s a good thing she seems to enjoy her royal status , even though friends are staggered by her life now			0
‘ she hated the idea of spending her life shaking hands and ribbon cutting			0
she was a bright , ambitious young girl who set up her pr business			0
i am astonished at the life she lives today , ’ says one			0
unofficially , @entity79 and @entity0 have the @entity327 role of attending all the weddings of crowned heads of @entity330 , representing the @entity26 for a new generation			1
it ’s not all glamour though : can you imagine any other royal visiting the @entity337 factory as @entity0 did last month , and actually putting on the workers ’ overalls and hairnet ? the @entity26 has rewritten the rules so when she and prince @entity342 die , @entity79 , rather than @entity95 , will become @entity343			1
with that in mind , @entity79 has picked up the most famous of his father ’s duties , which is the @entity349 , so that it will last into another generation			0
as the @entity26 knows , the future duchess of @entity353 will surely be his greatest asset .			2

the @entity26 has advised @entity0 on the rehabilitation of her image
at one time @entity0 considered leaving @entity359 in despair
@entity0 and the @entity26 enjoy late - night chats at @entity69 together
