the age - old problem of spreading butter straight from the fridge has finally been solved - thanks to this nifty new kitchen gadget			0
the revolutionary device looks like a normal cutlery knife but it has been made with 21 triangular holes down the blade that ' grate ' the butter			1
the tiny strips are much easier to spread than a knife loaded with cold butter so sandwich fans can finally avoid tearing holes in their bread trying in vain to get an even coating			1
until now , the only way to guarantee a smooth spread has been to take the chilled butter out of the fridge and let it warm up on the side			2
the stainless steel gadget , called the @entity38 , is the brainchild of friends @entity40 , 29 , @entity42 , 27 , and @entity43 , 48			0
mr @entity40 , from @entity44 , @entity45 , said : ' the idea of finding a better way to spread butter was bounced around between the three of us and we came up with this			0
smooth operator : device looks like a normal cutlery knife but it has been made with 21 triangular holes butter than never : the other side of the knife has a serrated edge so that it can be used to cut the sandwich or toast in half or get rid of the crusts			1
until now , sandwich lovers had to wait for butter to melt before spreading ' we realised that there was something really valuable and cool here			0

' the @entity38 works by turning the butter into small ribbon shapes which creates more surface area that becomes easier to spread			2
' it works best on butter that has been kept in the fridge as we have found it does n't curve as easily when it is room temperature			0
' we have tried to keep it as simple as possible so that anyone can use it , including children			0
' this is a time saving gadget because you do n't have to wait for the butter to reach room temperate before you use it and stops you from tearing up the bread			0
' the team have launched the @entity38 on @entity104 where they hope to raise £ 21,000 ( $ 34,990 ) for the manufacturing costs			2
when it hits the shelves , they estimate it will be on sale for between £ 6 to £ 8 ( $ 10 to $ 13.30 )			1

' @entity38 ' is still in development but could sell for £ 6 to £ 8 ( $ 10 to $ 13.30 )
it looks normal cutlery knife but it has been made with 21 triangular holes
these holes made down the blade of knife ' grate ' the butter into tiny strips
these strips are then easier to spread than a knife loaded with cold butter
