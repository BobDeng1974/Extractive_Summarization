former home secretary @entity0 has branded union leaders ' delusional ' after they attacked @entity2 over his leadership of the @entity4			1
the mp backed the beleaguered @entity4 leader after senior figures vented their anger over his decision to embrace austerity measures , and suggested that financial support for the party could be withdrawn			1
unions affiliated to @entity4 have been fuming since shadow chancellor @entity14 said that he would not promise to reverse @entity16 cuts or lift the 1 per cent pay cap on public sector workers			1
support : @entity0 ( right ) has hit out at ' delusional ' union bosses who have criticised @entity2 's leadership of the @entity4 unite leader @entity22 went public with his anger in a coded warning of a leadership coup , saying that mr @entity2 was setting @entity4 on course for electoral ' disaster ' and undermining his own leadership			1
and @entity30 general secretary @entity29 wrote to the union ’s senior officials saying that mr @entity14 ’s speech could have a ' profound impact ' on its relationship with the @entity4			2
but mr @entity0 - himself an ex-union general secretary - said mr @entity22 ’s intervention reminded him of a culture ' the movement had escaped '			2
' according to @entity22 , by trying to position @entity4 as a credible alternative to the coalition , @entity2 has set it on a path to " destruction " , ' the mp wrote in the @entity45			1
' stuck in a familiar groove , @entity22 goes on to suggest that all the ills that he claims are befalling @entity4 are because of actions of so called " @entity49 " - those terrible people who introduced the minimum wage and increased the number , the stature and indeed the pay of public sector workers across the country			1
' he went on : ' @entity2 has stated a simple fact ; that a @entity4 government will not be able to reverse as many of the cuts the current government is making unless it can show where the money is to come from			1
poll warning : @entity22 , left , accused the @entity4 of disenfranchising their own supporters after @entity14 said in a speech that he backed the @entity67 's stance on public sector pay freezes ' the difference between @entity22 ’s position and @entity2 ’s is that @entity22 believes a political party can win an election on a platform of promising no cuts , no job losses and continued levels of public expenditure			1
that is the policy of the delusional left who will never again win the public ’s trust			0
' the trade union movement lost its way in the late 1970s when it opposed the minimum wage and supported the closed shop			0
it needs to recognise that @entity2 ’s vision of a better future requires a change of mindset throughout the party if we ’re to spend one term in opposition rather than a decade			2
' the @entity30 , another of @entity4 ’s biggest donors , warned that mr @entity2 ’s decision to accept the government ’s one per cent pay cap was a ‘ serious mistake ’ and also indicated it could cut its traditional affiliation with his party			1
the heads of @entity104 , the @entity30 , the @entity105 and the @entity106 joined forces to attack the @entity108 after shadow chancellor @entity14 told a conference at the weekend the party was backing the pay cap for public sector workers and would retain it if returned to power			2
mr @entity22 said last night that there would be ‘ real serious long - term implications ’ if @entity4 is ‘ dragged to the @entity116 ’			1
he added : ‘ if @entity4 loses the next election i think there will be a serious rethink by a number of unions , including @entity104 , about our future relationships and the constitution of our political alliances			1
’ earlier he complained the change of heart on a public sector pay freeze was ‘ a victory for discredited @entity49 at the expense of the party ’s core supporters ’			0
mr @entity22 added : ‘ it challenges the course @entity2 has set for the party , and perhaps his leadership itself			1
’ @entity30 general secretary @entity29 warned that @entity4 ’s decision could have a ‘ profound impact ’			0
he said : ‘ it is time for careful consideration on the long - term implications this new stance by the party has on @entity30 affiliation			0
this is the most serious mistake they could have made			0
’ unions are responsible for 92 per cent of @entity4 funds			2
since the election , @entity104 has given @entity4 £ 7.6million , while the @entity30 has handed over £ 2.6million			1
last night mr @entity14 admitted : ‘ i do n’t want the @entity30 or @entity104 to disaffiliate from the @entity4			1
of course i take the threat seriously			0
’ @entity150 , the leader of the @entity105 , said @entity4 ’s new stance ‘ guarantees ’ that @entity4 will lose the next election ‘ and lose badly			0
’ @entity106 boss @entity154 added : ‘ @entity2 has jammed @entity4 ’s self - destruct mission into top gear			1
this betrayal of millions of @entity4 ’s core supporters sets him and his party on a one - way ticket to oblivion			0
’ but mr @entity2 hit back , saying : ‘ i am not going to change my policy in the face of threats			2
i will not back down			0
i stand up for what ’s right and if people do n’t like it , that ’s tough			0
’ mr @entity2 may have won the leadership battle with his brother @entity170 , but it seems his own deputy still has trouble getting the winner ’s name right			2
during an interview yesterday , @entity175 said : ‘ now we see @entity178 and @entity179 following @entity180 ... @entity2 ’s argument			0
’ however , her aides insisted that she was mistakenly referring to mr @entity178			0
after being deemed ' too ugly ' to become prime minister , @entity2 has been dealt another blow after it was revealed that 70 per cent of people do n't believe in him			0
the @entity187 poll gives him his worst rating since winning the @entity4 leadership and a sure sign that supporters are turning away from him			2
he received an overall rating of -3 points compared to @entity178 's 91 and @entity179 's 45 from @entity194			0
further rubbing salt into the wounds , most people said they believe his elder brother , @entity170 , would do a better job but he has ruled out standing again .			0

@entity22 of @entity104 gives coded warning of leadership coup as he says @entity4 will come to ' get ' @entity2
@entity2 hits back and says ' i have the stomach for the fight '
