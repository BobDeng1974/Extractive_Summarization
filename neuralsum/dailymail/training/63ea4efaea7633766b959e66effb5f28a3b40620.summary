@entity0 says that love is more important than money in his rocky relationship with @entity4			1
the @entity6 driver exhibited all his skills in coming fourth at sunday ’s @entity9 @entity8 — five places ahead of his @entity12 team - mate @entity11			1
yet , bar a late change of mind from the team hierarchy , it is @entity0 who will make way when @entity19 joins for next season , despite having outscored @entity11 106 points to 55 this season			1
@entity0 ( @entity23 ) exceeded expectations by finishing fourth at the @entity9 @entity8 @entity0 is expected to lose his place at @entity12 next season while teammate @entity11 ( r ) stays @entity0 accompanies fellow drivers @entity27 ( @entity23 ) and @entity28 at the @entity9 @entity8 in @entity29 @entity0 is sore			1
‘ you want to feel like you are wanted in a team and part of the family , ’ he said			2
‘ it ’s like if your parents were to turn round and say , “ we ’re not sure we want you at @entity36 this year			0
but your brother can come , he ’s great ”			0
‘ feeling part of a family is more important than money			0
‘ whatever happens next year , the money is not the issue in any way , shape or form , for me anyway			0
whether i ’m racing here in @entity4 or racing somewhere else , i do it because i love it			0
‘ i still want to earn money from it because i feel i have achieved and should get paid for what i do in a racing car and for what i bring to a team			1
but i ’m not a driver who takes the p * * * and i will race somewhere even if i ’m not getting the big bucks , unlike a few drivers who are out there			0
@entity0 , with @entity9 actress @entity61 , feels he still has a lot to offer @entity4 @entity0 is expected to be replaced by @entity63 's former world champion @entity19 at @entity12 ‘ you should get what you deserve and i feel i bring a lot not just in terms of results but in terms of marketing within a team and working with sponsors , and how i can help develop a car			1
’ the decision whether to keep @entity0 rests with @entity75 , the group chairman , and @entity77 , the racing director			1
part of the reason they prefer @entity11 is money - related			1
the @entity82 earns £ 500,000 a year whereas @entity0 is on about £ 10million			2
@entity19 ’s wages , which will be in excess of £ 15m , must be accommodated			2
the burden will be shared half and half with @entity12 ’s incoming partners @entity88			2
@entity0 added : ‘ i have n’t spoken to @entity75 since @entity89 ( the previous race )			1
it ’s not for me to talk to him			0
i ’m just doing my job , enjoying racing and getting the most from the car , and that does n’t include discussing the future with @entity75 because that ’s not where my head wants to be			2
@entity12 chief @entity75 will have the final say on the @entity6 driver 's future with the marque @entity0 admits feeling emotional after reading heartfelt messages of support from fans on @entity106 ‘ when i ’m on @entity106 looking at fans ’ messages , i have n’t seen a negative comment for some time			1
it makes you very emotional seeing how much support you get from the fans			0
there ’s even more support than when i won the world championship			0
that really does mean a lot			0
‘ i did some tv and they said “ do you want to stay if you can win races ? ” and i said “ yeah , i ’ve done my schooling in @entity4 , i ’ve come of age at 34 , i ’m ready for it ! ” ‘ in @entity9 we were almost fighting for the podium , though a couple of steps are still needed to fight for wins			2
i really enjoyed it and if every race was like that , you ’d want to race for several more years			0

@entity0 *battled* to fourth place for @entity12 at @entity9 @entity8
@entity6 driver looks set to be replaced by @entity19 next season
@entity75 will make final decision , although retaining @entity11 would save the team money
