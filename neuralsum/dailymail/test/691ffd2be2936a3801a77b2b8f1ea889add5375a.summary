@entity0 talks about being as free as a bird , back to the days when he was banging in the goals in @entity3 for @entity4			2
a big hit on the famous steeped terracing at @entity7 as he followed in the footsteps of @entity9 , @entity10 and some of the other greats			0
here in @entity12 he is worshipped at the @entity13 , one of the idols in the shirt of the @entity17 with that fearless , wholehearted approach to the game			0
@entity0 ( left ) is worshipped by @entity17 fans and has scored six @entity22 goals this season the @entity24 side are aiming to beat @entity25 on tuesday in their @entity22 quarter - final first leg on tuesday evening , with six goals already in this season ’s @entity22 , he will be expected to deliver in the first leg of the quarter - final against @entity25			1
@entity17 are already on course for the @entity32 title , 12 points clear of nearest rivals @entity34 ahead of their meeting in the league this weekend			0
first though , @entity38 ’s team must find a way to beat @entity25 , to secure a decent first - leg lead against the surprise quarter - finalists before the return in the @entity43 at 31 @entity0 appears to be enjoying his football again , helping @entity17 to the title last season and leading the assault on the @entity22 this term			1
@entity38 is hoping to end 19 years of @entity22 hurt by taking @entity17 to glory @entity25 stand in @entity17 ' way ; they were adventurous and audacious in their win over @entity51 in the last 16 it is easy to knock @entity24 football , to place it behind @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , but to do that would do a great disservice to this @entity17 team			1
there are some formidable talents in there , with @entity63 protected in his goal by the tough , uncompromising presence of @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 in their three - man defence			0
the prolonged absence of @entity71 , who has made five appearances in this season ’s competition , has given others a chance to excel in the centre of this @entity17 midfield			1
@entity79 , one of the summer targets for @entity81 , is missing but @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 all have pedigree			2
@entity0 admits he feels free at @entity17 , back to the days when he was playing for @entity4 ( pictured ) @entity25 players train at the @entity13 in @entity12 on the eve of their @entity22 quarter - final it has been 12 years since they last reached the @entity22 final , when they were beaten by @entity91 on penalties during a dreadful stalemate that finished 0 - 0 at @entity94			1
for supporters of @entity17 it has been too long , with the shootout victory over @entity98 in 1996 at the @entity99 in @entity100 a distant memory			1
they have won the @entity22 twice and would dearly love a third			0
standing in their way of a semi-final appearance is @entity25 , the surprise team to make it through after their remarkable win over @entity51 in the previous round			2
at the @entity112 , @entity111 ’s team were adventurous and audacious , surprising @entity51 with their breathtaking approach to the game			2
they are not to be underestimated			0
@entity116 lifts the @entity22 for @entity17 in 1996 - the last time the @entity17 were victorious in 2003 , @entity17 suffered heartbreak in the @entity22 final , losing to @entity91 in a penalty shootout despite the big , high - profile exits of @entity121 to @entity122 and @entity124 ’s season - long loan to @entity81 , they are difficult to beat			1
@entity125 is a classy player in the centre of their midfield and the @entity130 international @entity129 can always pick out a pass			0
up front is @entity133 , one of the scorers at the @entity112 on the night of that incredible and climactic 3 - 1 victory in the first leg			0
@entity133 is one of the men standing in @entity17 ' way in their @entity22 quarter - final @entity0 is adored by @entity17 supporters and they will hope he is the man to help them to @entity143 glory it was after that game when @entity146 headed straight for the tunnel , failing to shake the hand of @entity25 ’s @entity150 coach following @entity51 ’s defeat			1
when @entity25 scraped through on away goals , @entity111 made a point of calling @entity146 ‘ disrespectful ’ for his behaviour , which is familiar to all @entity156 football fans , on the touchline			1
here in @entity12 , the @entity25 coach talked of being worthy of their place in the quarter - final , good enough to live with the very best teams left in the tournament			0
now , inside this magnificent new stadium , they get to meet one of them .			0

@entity17 face @entity25 in @entity22 quarters on tuesday
@entity0 has already scored six goals in the competition this season
@entity17 fans worship @entity0 and expect him to fire them to victory
the @entity24 side are missing @entity79 , but that has enabled other midfield players to come to the fore and *impress*
@entity17 have not won the @entity22 since 1996 , later suffering heartache in a penalty shootout defeat by @entity91 in 2003
@entity25 boss @entity111 : @entity17 are a better team than @entity51 !
