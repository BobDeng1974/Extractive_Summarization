by @entity1 reporter @entity2 ended his extended and acrimonious fight with @entity4 on friday , withdrawing a pair of lawsuits and accepting a season - long suspension that marks the longest penalty in the sport 's history related to performance - enhancing drugs			1
@entity2 , who has steadfastly denied using banned substances while with the @entity13 , made the decision nearly four weeks after arbitrator @entity15 largely upheld the discipline issued last summer by baseball commissioner @entity17			1
' i think it 's a good move for him , ' former commissioner @entity18 said			0
' @entity2 had no chance legally , and the commissioner got his authority validated			2
' outta there : suspended @entity13 third baseman @entity2 abandoned his fight against @entity4 on friday , dropping his lawsuit for tortious interference in @entity28 in @entity29 @entity2 was among 14 players suspended last summer following @entity4 's investigation of a @entity33 anti-aging clinic accused of distributing banned substances			1
given the harshest punishment , @entity2 was the only player to contest his penalty			1
the @entity37 filed a grievance , arguing @entity2 's 211 - game ban was unwarranted or at the very least excessive			1
@entity2 also sued @entity4 and @entity17 in october , accusing them of ' vigilante justice ' as part of a ' witch hunt ' against him			1
@entity15 presided over 12 days of hearings last fall highlighted by @entity2 's decision not to testify			2
@entity15 concluded on jan. 11 there was ' clear and convincing evidence ' @entity2 used three banned substances over the course of three years — human growth hormone , testosterone and insulin - like growth factor 1			2
@entity15 also ruled @entity2 twice tried to obstruct baseball 's investigation , but he nonetheless reduced the suspension to 162 games plus the 2014 postseason after weighing it against baseball 's ' just cause ' standard			1
@entity2 leaves the offices of @entity4 in @entity61 on september 30 , 2013			2
@entity2 accepted his season - long suspension from @entity4 , the longest penalty in the sport 's history related to performance - enhancing drugs @entity2 sued @entity4 and the union two days later in federal court in @entity29			1
but the @entity69 has established narrow grounds for overturning arbitration decisions , and legal experts said @entity2 had virtually no chance of succeeding in his attempt to have @entity15 's decision vacated			2
without making any admissions , @entity2 's lawyers filed notices of dismissal in both cases friday			1
@entity4 issued a low - key statement calling the decision to end the litigation ' prudent '			2
' we believe that mr. @entity2 's actions show his desire to return the focus to the play of our great game on the field and to all of the positive attributes and actions of his fellow major league players , ' the sport said			0
' we share that desire			0
' @entity2 had angered many of his fellow players by suing his own union in an attempt to avoid a suspension			2
withdrawing the lawsuits was perhaps the start of mending relationships with fellow players			0
' @entity2 has done the right thing by withdrawing his lawsuit , ' the union said in a statement			0
' his decision to move forward is in everyone 's best interest			0
' @entity2 ( right ) runs sprints with fellow yankee @entity113			0
@entity2 has accepted a 162 - game ban for using controlled substances , which he has long denied @entity2 in 2009 admitted he used banned substances from 2001 - 03 while with @entity122 , before baseball had penalties in place for @entity121			1
after @entity4 's investigation was sparked 13 months ago by a report in @entity125 , @entity2 repeatedly said he had not failed any drug test and claimed evidence provided to @entity4 by @entity128 , founder of the biogenesis of @entity131 clinic , was not trustworthy			1
when @entity15 issued his decision , the three - time @entity133 defiantly proclaimed , ' no player should have to go through what i have been dealing with '			0
he announced : ' i am exhausting all options to ensure not only that i get justice , but that players ' contracts and rights are protected			0
' but a few hours after the @entity141 became the first team this year to start spring training workouts , and with the @entity13 a week from opening camp , @entity2 folded quietly			2
he was in @entity125 on friday and made no public remarks			0
' the statements that were issued say everything that needs to be said			0
we have no further comments on this matter , ' @entity148 , one of @entity2 's nine attorneys , said in an email			0
@entity148 said @entity2 no longer intended to report this month to the @entity13 ' training camp in @entity155 , @entity33 @entity13 ' @entity2 heads to the dugout during the @entity13 ' 5 - 1 loss to the @entity158 in a baseball game at @entity160 in @entity161 on september 14 , 2013 suspensions only cover regular - season games and the postseason , with exhibitions specifically exempted			1
@entity2 will lose most of his $ 25 million salary — @entity15 ruled he is entitled to 21 - 183rds , which comes to $ 2,868,852.46			1
the third baseman will be 39 when he is eligible to return in a year , and he has incentive to play during the final three seasons of his contract			0
the @entity13 owe him $ 21 million in 2015 and $ 20 million in each of the final two seasons of the record $ 275 million , 10 - year deal			1
but the 14 - time all - star has been hobbled by injuries in recent years and has not played a full season since 2007			0
the timing of @entity2 's decision was set in motion by @entity131 district judge @entity180 , who on jan. 30 told the player 's lawyers to respond by friday to arguments from @entity4 and the union that the case should be dismissed			1
@entity2 does have one lawsuit remaining			0
he sued @entity13 physician dr. @entity187 and @entity188 in @entity189 in october , claiming they mishandled his medical care during the 2012 @entity133 playoffs			0
@entity2 later was diagnosed with a hip injury that required surgery and did not return to the @entity13 until aug. 5 — hours after his suspension was announced by @entity17 .			1

@entity2 *appears* ready to accept the penalty for using performance - enhancing drugs
notices of dismissal in lawsuits against @entity4 and @entity37 were filed in @entity29 on friday
it ends a long - running quest to have his ruling overturned
the suspended @entity13 player will see out a season - long suspension - longest ever sentence dealt in a drug case in the history of baseball
he will only be paid about $ *2.8* million of his $ 25 million salary
