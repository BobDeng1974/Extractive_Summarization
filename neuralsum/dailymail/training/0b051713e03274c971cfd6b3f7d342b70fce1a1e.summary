by @entity0 published : 11:20 est , 20 december 2012 updated : 11:25 est , 20 december 2012 a key patent that @entity2 used to extract more than a billion dollars in damages from smartphone rival @entity4 is under threat after @entity7 authorities rejected its claims			1
@entity2 scored a sweeping legal victory over its @entity11 competitor in august when a jury found @entity4 had copied critical features of the @entity14 and @entity15			1
the jury had ruled that @entity4 had infringed six of seven @entity2 patents and the @entity19 firm was awarded a mammoth $ 1.05billion ( Â£ 645billion ) in damages			1
pinch to zoom : the @entity14 was one of the first touchscreen gadgets to have the feature - but the @entity25 has ruled @entity2 's patent on the invention is invalid but the @entity25 yesterday rejected all 21 claims of @entity7 patent no. 7,844,915 - known as the ' pinch - to - zoom ' patent - after looking at it again			1
the ' pinch - to - zoom ' feature , which was among the intellectual property contested at the trial , allows users to zoom in or out by moving two fingers apart or closer together while touching the display			0
@entity4 's lawyers pointed the rejection out in a filing to @entity7 district court judge @entity42 yesterday afternoon , @entity38 reported , noting it was ' relevant ' to the company 's attempts to force a retrial			2
the @entity46 : @entity4 's flagship phone also uses the feature , which was one of the claims cited in @entity2 's $ 1bn lawsuit against their competitor @entity2 has also attempted to get an injunction against a number of @entity4 's products for infringing the ' pinch to zoom ' patent			1
@entity4 and @entity2 , the world 's top two smartphone makers , are locked in patent disputes in at least 10 countries as they vie to dominate the lucrative mobile market and win over customers with their latest gadgets			2
@entity4 won a preliminary invalidation of @entity2 's ' rubber - banding ' patent in october that had the ' bounce ' feature			2
the patent is for a feature which allows users with touchscreens to bounce back to the image on the screen if they attempt to scroll beyond the edge			0
the ruling by the @entity7 patent office after @entity4 requested an examination of the patent was included in documents filed by @entity4 in a federal court in @entity81 , @entity82			0
@entity2 's claims were rejected on the grounds that prior patents , including one from the @entity7 and one from @entity87 , already covered the inventions			0
when the @entity7 patent office rules against a patent , the full process involves multiple steps and can take years			0
it can also often be appealed in court , further tying up the process			0
representatives for @entity2 and @entity4 were not immediately available for comment			2
a @entity97 court ruled in october that @entity4 did not infringe on @entity2 's patent by using certain multi-touch techniques on some of the @entity101 smartphones and tablet computers			1
@entity2 's shares have taken a beating recently , with investors worried about rising competition from @entity4 and other mobile device makers using @entity110 's @entity109 platform .			0

' pinch to zoom ' was one of six @entity2 patents a jury ruled that @entity4 had infringed after august trial
@entity11 tech giant was ordered to *pay* $ 1.05billion to @entity2 in damages , but has since sought a retrial
the patent rejection is the second to have rocked @entity2 in the past few months
