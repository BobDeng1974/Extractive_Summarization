by @entity0 published : 08:47 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 09:28 est , 3 may 2013 it would be the ultimate coup for any charity to get @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 to appear at a fundraising event			1
but a closer look reveals that things are n't quite as they seem			0
the group of ' stars ' are actually professional lookalikes who earn thousands of pounds every week by appearing at events as doppelgangers of real life celebrities			1
on this occasion they waived their fees to make an appearance as charity fundraiser in @entity24 to raise money to help fight breast cancer			1
double trouble : @entity4 and @entity28 have an argument at the lookalike charity event in @entity24 double take : @entity4 and @entity32 share an intimate moment as the lookalikes are in fact a couple in real life ' uncanny ' : from a distance you could almost believe you were looking at a particularly odd mix of celebrities who would ever ever believe that that was @entity6 ... like ever ? the event , held at a @entity45 restaurant in @entity24 , was organised after @entity8 lookalike @entity46 lost her mother to cancer earlier this year			1
. diners were said to be ' stunned ' when celebrity chef @entity28 gave @entity4 a grilling before chatting up pop princess @entity6			1
@entity4 lookalike @entity51 , 54 , and @entity28 double @entity52 , 42 , a factory worker from @entity54 , fooled onlookers as they rowed in the middle of the restaurant			0
@entity5 @entity5 's lookalike @entity7 @entity7 's lookalike @entity59 @entity59 @entity6 @entity6 @entity8 's lookalike @entity8 @entity4 's lookalike @entity4 customers were even more stunned when they spotted the @entity64 chief with @entity6 doppelganger @entity65 , 18			2
other lookalikes who joined in the fun included an @entity59 , a @entity7 and a ' dead ringer ' for pop veteran sir @entity70			0
stellar : it would certainly be a big coup for any charity if they managed to get such a wide range of stars to turn up to a single event doppelgangers ? @entity32 and @entity59 ( left ) attended along with @entity70 ( right ) but the real shock came when @entity4 ended the evening by smooching @entity32 singer @entity8 - who is in fact his fiancee @entity82 , 43 , from @entity83			2
one shocked customer said : ' i could n't believe what i was seeing when i saw @entity28 effing and blinding at @entity4			0
' @entity4 then walked over to the bar area and was having a cosy chat with @entity6 - it was like being in the middle of a top celebrity party			2
' it was astonishing and everyone in the restaurant gasped until the ' stars ' all fell about laughing and explained they were lookalikes			0
' it still looked weird to see @entity4 having a snog with @entity32 though , some people took pictures on their mobile phones even though they knew they were lookalikes			0
' @entity4 lookalike @entity51 said : ' it was a great evening and it is always fun to see people 's reactions when they see us all dressed as the celebrities we imitate			0
' convinced ? dinners were reportedly shocked when @entity4 and @entity28 started to have an argument at the event how to look good as a lookalike : @entity4 and @entity7 show the others how it 's done uncanny ! @entity8 with @entity6 , and right , @entity6 with @entity4 being ' papped ' : @entity28 poses for a picture with a fan surreal : @entity8 and @entity4 are a real life couple and engaged to be married - just imagine the celebrity wedding she knows you 're trouble : @entity4 was spotted chatting up @entity6 , who is in reality doppelganger @entity65 , 18 do you remember ? stars from previous eras @entity124 and @entity70 enjoy a chat seeing stars : ( @entity127 ) @entity6 , @entity4 , @entity32 , @entity59 and @entity28			1
