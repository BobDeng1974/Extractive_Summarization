@entity1 's flagship energy freeze policy was plunged into chaos last night as power companies finally started cutting their bills			1
in a major u-turn , the party was forced to issue a ‘ clarification ’ that the plan would be converted to a ‘ cap ’ if energy prices continue to fall			1
a senior source also warned that the idea – launched in a blaze of publicity by @entity15 in 2013 – may have to be ‘ re-branded ’ to make it clear that bills will not be frozen at a high level if tariffs are dropping			1
the source said : ‘ the freeze was announced at a time when energy prices were rising inexorably – nobody was talking about prices coming down , or even thinking about it			2
obviously , if bills are coming down at the election there may have to be a bit of rebranding to make it clear it will operate as a price cap instead			0
chief executive @entity49 said the move was a ‘ risk ’ with @entity1 ’s price freeze hovering in the background , amid enormous pressure for utility firms to cut bills in line with falling wholesale costs of oil and gas			2
business and energy minister @entity35 last night said @entity1 ’s shift of policy exposed the ‘ nonsensical ’ idea of trying to fix commodity markets			1
‘ @entity1 are in chaos and they must tell the public whether they want to freeze energy bills at higher rates or not , ’ he said			1
‘ it underlines the massive threat posed by @entity1 and how they can not be trusted with the nation ’s finances			0
’ mr @entity15 , announcing his policy at @entity1 ’s 2013 conference , said he would ‘ freeze gas and electricity prices until the start of 2017 ’			1
the idea was promoted with an image of an energy bill frozen in a block of ice – and it still features prominently on the party ’s website			0
a @entity86 source last night likened the policy to a ‘ melting ice cap ’			0
however a @entity1 spokesman denied there had been a u-turn , saying : ‘ it has always been a cap , which would stop energy companies putting up prices , but not stop them cutting them			1
’ the party will today highlight figures showing the average household ’s energy bill is now £ 260 a year higher than in 2010 – with the poorest families hit the hardest			0
but @entity1 was unable to produce any documentation referring to its policy as a cap			2
@entity1 will force a @entity106 vote on the issue today			2
mr @entity15 ’s price freeze has been blamed for keeping energy prices artificially high in recent months , as firms stockpile supplies at high prices			1
@entity113 , former chairman of the @entity114 , warned that in any freeze ‘ lower wholesale prices might not get passed on ’			0
@entity117 , of @entity118 , warned that the policy acts a ' disincentive for them to cut prices ' a senior source at one of @entity126 ’s ‘ @entity127 ’ energy firms said it would have cut bills already if it had not been for mr @entity15 ’s pledge			1
‘ we already take a risk setting prices over one year , ’ said the source			0
‘ when it ’s nearly two years , you double the risk , especially with the increasing costs of distribution and of government social and environmental policies			0
’ @entity117 , of @entity118 , warned this week that the policy acts as a ‘ disincentive for them to cut prices ’			0
he said energy firms were ‘ gaming the system ’ to avoid having their prices frozen at a level they could not sustain .			0
