by @entity0 it is the size of a strawberry and weighs a bit less than three pound coins			0
but if you had this rare blue beauty in your pocket you would be carrying around a diamond that could be worth more than £ 60million			1
the ‘ exceptional ’ 122.5 - carat blue diamond was unearthed at the @entity11 mine in @entity12 which is renowned for producing giant gems			1
rare gem : @entity15 said it had recovered the ' exceptional ' 122.52 - carat gem ( pictured from two angles ) at its @entity11 mine in @entity12 sparkler : the jewel , about the size of a strawberry ( pictured ) , is so pure that it is expected to eclipse the current world 's most expensive diamond - a 507 - carat white diamond dug from the same mine that sold for £ 20 million in 2010 a blue stone from the mine fetched £ 508,000 per carat earlier this year			1
if this much larger one achieves a similar valuation , it would command a price tag of £ 62million – smashing the record price paid for a rough stone			2
anyone who buys it , however , will be hoping for better luck than the owners of the famous deep blue @entity39			2
it supposedly puts a curse on those who possess it , as the guillotined @entity44 and his wife @entity45 discovered			0
the newly discovered diamond was dug up by @entity47 - based @entity15 at its mine near @entity49			1
one industry insider said it was almost unheard of to find a blue stone weighing more than 100 carats			2
diamond mine : other notable diamonds discovered at the @entity11 mine ( pictured ) are the 25.5 carat @entity11 blue diamond found in 2013 and sold for £ 10 million ( $ 16.9 million ) , and the @entity58 diamond found in 2008 and sold for £ 5.59 million ( $ 9.49 million ) rough diamond : it comes months after @entity15 sold a 29.6 carat blue diamond ( pictured ) from the same mine for more than $ 25 million rough to royalty : a miner holds the @entity65 shortly after it was found in 1907 ( left ) before it was cut in two and used for the @entity66 and @entity67 ( pictured on the head of @entity69 in 2009 ) a carat is equal to one - fifth of a gram , so @entity15 ’s 122.5 - carat stone is about 25g			1
in comparison , the average centrepiece diamond on an engagement ring weighs about one carat and is usually white			1
shares in @entity15 rose nearly 8 per cent on the find yesterday , adding some £ 66million to the value of the company in a day			2
the 45 - carat blue @entity39 , which is said to put a curse on its owner , is worth more than £ 200million			1
it is thought to have been stolen in 1653 in @entity83 from a statue of @entity86 goddess @entity85 by @entity87 , who was reported to have been killed by rabid dogs at the age of 84			0
the diamond is also known as @entity91 , or @entity92 , and was owned by @entity44 and @entity45 who were guillotined in 1793 by the @entity94 revolutionaries			0
it is then thought to have been smuggled to @entity96			0
lord @entity100 , after whose family it is named , had to sell it in 1894 after going bankrupt			0
another supposed victim , prince @entity102 , was killed by @entity104 revolutionaries			0
today it is in the @entity107 natural history museum in @entity108			0
the current record price for a rough stone was set by @entity15 ’s sale of the 507 - carat @entity112 , a white diamond , in 2010 for nearly £ 21million			1
blue diamonds get their colour from small amounts of the chemical element boron trapped in their crystal structure			0
the more ‘ blue ’ it is , the greater the value			0
they are the rarest diamonds after red , which are almost never found			0
@entity15 ’s blue diamond is being kept under guard at a secret location in @entity12 and will be sold in a private tender process in @entity129 before being cut and polished			1
the @entity11 mine is recognised as the most important diamond mine in the world			1
it is famous for producing the world ’s largest white diamond , the 3,106 - carat @entity65 , which was found in 1905			1
the door - stopping diamond was originally discarded by a hasty mine manager who thought it was too big to be anything other than a crystal			2
it was recovered and presented to @entity142 in 1907 , and gems cut from it are centrepieces of the @entity146 at the @entity147			0
@entity15 believe the mine has another 50 years left in it .			2

it was found by @entity15 at its @entity11 mine in @entity12
comes months after it sold 29.6 - carat blue diamond from mine for £ *14m*
it is expected to eclipse world 's most expensive , a 507 - carat white diamond
