‘ i ’m glad i did what i did and i respect the jury ’s decision			2
i just hope the police continue to take women ’s claims seriously and i hope other people are n’t put off coming forward			2
‘ i feel , please @entity29 , let @entity30 continue with the same vigour			2
they must not think that they have failed			2
’ last night she said giving evidence had been tough but that she would go through it again , even though @entity3 had been cleared			1
‘ it was one of the hardest things i have ever done , but if i had to go through all of this again , i would			2
i really would , ’ she said			2
‘ historical cases are always difficult for jurors			2
they have a difficult job			2
the verdicts are a shock			1
‘ i ’m just blown away really			2
it must have been well nigh impossible for the jury			2
the fact they could n’t decide on two counts shows how hard it was			0
’ cleared : @entity3 appears outside of @entity49 yesterday after being found not guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault @entity52 also expressed her sympathy for @entity3 ’s other accusers , saying : ‘ i ’m gutted for all of the girls			1
they must all be feeling terrible			0
but they should all know that what we did was very brave			0
‘ the original fear , at the start of all this , was simply that i would n’t be believed			0
i totally respect the jury ’s decision and it clearly was n’t an easy one for them			0
‘ nothing changes the way i feel about what happened all those years ago			0
’ she added : ‘ i do n’t feel let down by the police , not at all			0
they have worked very hard and they have given us a voice			1
i think that ’s the most important thing of all , even if the verdict is disappointing			0
‘ it is just nice to know that we are being listened to , even if in court it is impossible to prove so that the jury can totally believe			0
but , no , i praise @entity9			0
’ it was @entity52 ’s claims that triggered the police investigation into @entity3			1
she was a 17 - year - old archivist working at @entity84 in @entity85 when she met the dj in the 1970s			1
she told the jury he had given her lifts in his famous ‘ big yellow banana ’ , a @entity91 car , but had assaulted her in a @entity93 studio in 1977 while he was live on @entity94			1
claims : the accusations had related mainly to @entity3 's time as a @entity93 @entity16 in the 1970s and 1980s historic cases : @entity3 was prosecuted as a result of @entity9 , launched in 2012 after @entity100 was exposed as a predatory peadophile			1
@entity3 is pictured here on @entity103 with @entity100 she accused him of switching off the studio light and putting on a ‘ smoochy ’ song , before grabbing her tightly to dance			1
claiming he was aroused , @entity52 said : ‘ i was horrified			0
i did n’t know what it was			0
it sounds stupid but i was still a virgin			0
’ he pinned her against the wall and thrust his fingers into her underwear , she alleged			0
but the jury rejected her claims and cleared @entity3 of indecently assaulting her			1
in a separate interview she told @entity118 that there should not be a ‘ sell - by date ’ on complaints , adding : ‘ i worry that the verdict will prevent other people from coming forward			1
‘ it ’s tough enough anyway and the precedent is still to be made , in so much that it will put people off in coming forward with complaints about abuse that they ’ve received – whether it be last week or 30 years ago			0
but my message to anybody who is listening is please do n’t be put off			0
‘ although it ’s tough to go through the trial , and to be in court and to be cross-examined , you ’ve done something valuable			1
‘ it ’s quite scary what they will drag up from your own past in order to cast doubt in the jury ’s minds			0
but having said that , i would still happily do it again			0
‘ i think that there has to be some kind of understanding that in an historical abuse claim , some of the witnesses will have forgotten , some of them will be dead			0
' the fact that you did n’t complain at the time implies that there is a sell - by date , if you like , on a complaint			1
’ @entity52 , of @entity161 , decided to waive her legal right to anonymity in return for a donation to the charity @entity166			0
she has never asked for any payment for herself			0

’ she told the jury at @entity3 ’s trial : ‘ i felt like the @entity93 had slammed the door in my face			1
’ @entity52 added : ‘ the @entity93 did not want to know when i complained in 2012 , whereas the police took my complaint seriously from the start			1
