today @entity0 drives a car , holds down a job and is planning a family with his loving wife			1
after eight terrifying years trapped inside his own body unable to speak or move , the ‘ @entity8 ’ has made a truly miraculous recovery			2
yet the true depth of what he endured has never before been disclosed , not even in his best - selling book , which is once again climbing the charts			0
because , as he reveals today with shocking candour , his years of waking nightmare were further poisoned by physical and sexual abuse whenever his exhausted parents left him in the hands of a care home			1
for @entity0 , a web designer from @entity34 , the land of his birth is forever tainted by illness and cruelty			1
‘ i would dread it whenever my parents told me they were taking me to the care home because i knew what would happen and i had no way of letting them know the agonies i ’d suffer , ’ he told @entity39			1
of course they felt dreadful when they eventually found out and my father @entity50 reported what happened but of course everyone denied it and as a result i have never had justice			1
‘ people in the care home would pull my hair making my eyes water , the metal spoon would crash against my teeth as they forced food into my mouth			1
‘ when it made me sick they ’d shout and scream at me			2
i knew if i cried it would only make it worse			0
‘ i would be forced to drink scalding tea or fed until i was sick , then i ’d be slapped , shouted at , made to feel worthless , then would come the sexual attacks from women who were supposed to be looking after me			2
‘ one woman would come into the room and straddle me and simulate sex with me and touch me inappropriately			0
nothing made me feel more powerless , i longed to run away ’			2
it was a lesser ordeal , maybe , but he was also forced to watch endless re-runs of children ’s cartoon @entity78 , which itself became a form of torture			0
@entity0 , front , with his family in the last picture before the illness struck and left him in a virtual coma loving family : @entity0 and his father @entity50 as the mystery illness began to take hold when he was just 12 years of age ‘ each day i ’d count down the minutes until it was over and i was 24 hours closer to going home			1
’ @entity0 ’s father tried to take action when they eventually realised what had been happening but they denied it and said there was no evidence			1
@entity0 ’s miraculous recovery was recounted in his book @entity8 , first serialised in @entity39			1
he became ill at 12 , developing sore throat that soon became a mystery illness			1
in the months that followed his mind and body broke down and he became trapped in the shell of child he had once been			0
@entity0 , pictured left , was also forced to watch endless re-runs of children ’s cartoon @entity78 , pictured right , which itself became a form of torture as his illness , which is believed to have been a degenerative neurological disorder , took hold , @entity0 became completely unresponsive			1
doctors told his devastated parents to simply wait for him to die			1
ultimately , @entity0 became utterly unresponsive			1
yet at the age of 16 , he suddenly began to become aware of his surroundings and by the age of 19 his mind was fully intact			2
but , frighteningly , he was still unable to communicate			0
‘ you have no idea how frightening it was			0
the stark reality that i was going to spend the rest of my life like that , totally alone , ’ he said			2
‘ i could n’t make a sign or a sound to let anyone know i ’d become aware again			0
i was invisible , a ghost boy			0
’ @entity0 ’s miraculous recovery was recounted in his book @entity8			1
@entity138 is now fighting over his story to make it into a movie such were the depths of his family ’s despair in those early years , that his agonised mother @entity145 , 64 , told him she hoped he ’d die before then trying to kill herself			2
abandoned by doctors who were baffled by his mysterious illness , @entity0 regained full consciousness at 25			1
@entity0 met his wife @entity149 , now a social worker , on the internet			1
they talked by email and , before long , she asked him to visit her in @entity153			1
life partners : @entity0 and @entity22 shortly after their engagement now , as he sits with his wife in a country manor hotel near his home in @entity162 , speaking with the aid of a voice synthesiser , @entity0 admits the continued interest in his story is at times overwhelming			1
@entity0 , says proudly : ‘ getting a degree was never something i could imagine happening			1
i had stopped my schooling at 12 , i had no memory of anything – basic maths , the alphabet – but i went along to an open day at the @entity171			2
‘ they told me to write about why i wanted to study @entity176 and to my shock and amazement they offered me a place unconditionally ’			2
despite not being able to hold a pen at the time , he applied for a scholarship from @entity183 and fought off competition from @entity186 and @entity187 students to secure a grant to help pay for his studies			0
‘ i am by nature quite a shy , reserved person and but i made new friends at university , we were all geeks together			2
i learned a lot and grew an enormous amount as a person , i felt more confident and it was as if i was able to regain a big part of my life that i ’d missed out on			1
‘ but it was n’t easy			0
i was juggling full - time studies with working and a five hour daily bus commute			0
and on top of that i had to learn all the basic maths – like multiplication and algebra – that my memory had erased ’			0
@entity0 admits that graduating in july 2013 was one of the proudest days of his life			1
milestone : @entity0 and @entity22 on their wedding day in 2009			1
the happy couple has set up home in @entity215 and now rarely returns to his native @entity31 ‘ the ceremony in @entity218 was amazing , my parents flew over from @entity31 and i was even asked to speak on behalf of the other graduates			1
it was very emotional for all of us , we could never have believed i could succeed like that ’			0
@entity0 ’s next milestone was learning to drive and in 2012 he went for an assessment to determine if he ’d be safe on the road			2
‘ it took a while to find an instructor who could teach me to drive an adapted car so i studied for my theory test in the meantime and passed first time			0
my first time scared me initially , the closest i had come to driving was controlling my electric wheelchair and i was terrified that if i was n’t properly in control i could injure someone			0
@entity0 , pictured with wife @entity22 , says he would like to be played by @entity237 if his story is turned into a movie ‘ but my instructor told me i was a natural and took to it like a duck to water and after 40 lessons i passed my test in october 2013 , i was ecstatic			1
my confidence has built and now i drive all over the country which has helped me build up my computer consultancy business and given me a freedom once unimaginable to me ’			0
his book is enjoying renewed popularity and has once again reached number 5 in the @entity253 best sellers list			0
with 40 rival @entity138 film makers competing for the rights to his story , it looks as though his life will be immortalised on screen , too			0
determined to build a new future , he and @entity149 are now planning a family , something they had initially ruled out			0
‘ she is the love of my life and perhaps , selfishly , we did n’t want to share each other with anyone else			0
‘ but now i ’ve finished studying and we are in a better position financially and professionally and we would love to have a family of our own			0
we are a little older now but we hope it may happen , we will just have to see ’			0
the couple hope that with @entity138 knocking at their door they may eventually be able to move out of their small flat but like everything else in his life , @entity0 takes each new day in his stride			1
and his sense of humour has never waned			0
asked who might play them on screen he confesses @entity237 and @entity284 are their favourites			0
‘ anyone good looking , obviously ’ , he jokes			0
ghost boy by @entity0 is published by @entity288 .			2
