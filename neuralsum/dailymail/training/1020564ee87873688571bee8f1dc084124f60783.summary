she addressed the deal in her statement , saying , ' as for the alleged " book deal , " there is not one at this time			1
inside the courtroom : the unidentified juror said that she felt @entity2 was justified in killing @entity11 because he felt threatened , even though she admits @entity2 may have ' enhanced ' the story ' there was an agreement with a literary agent to explore the concept of a book which discussed the impact of sequestration on my perceptions of this serious case , while being compared to the perceptions of an attorney who was closely following the trial from outside the " bubble , " ' she added			1
' the relationship with the agent ceased the moment i realized what had been occurring in the world during the weeks of my sequestration			2
' juror @entity7 made the statements after four other jurors released a statement distancing themselves from her			1
' the opinions of @entity7 , expressed on the @entity30 show were her own , and not in any way representative of the jurors listed below , ' they said in the statement released tuesday night			1
in an effort to maintain their privacy , the four women identified themselves only as @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			1
one juror - @entity78 - did not sign the document			2
' serving on this jury has been a highly emotional and physically draining experience for each of us , ' the statement read			1

' the death of a teenager weighed heavily on our hearts but in the end we did what the law required us to do			0
' even though they backed away from juror @entity7 's claims , all six of the women had to agree on the not guilty verdict before it was announced on saturday night			1
one of her most controversial claims in the @entity30 interview was that @entity11 ' played a huge role in his death '			0
' when @entity2 confronted him he could have walked away and gone home , ' the woman , identified only as juror @entity7 , said in the second portion of her post-trial interview			1
while she was apologetic to the teenager 's family , she seemed more sympathetic to @entity2 's position in the midst of the fight , as opposed to @entity11 's own self defense			1
' i have no doubt that @entity2 feared for his life , ' she said to @entity14 's @entity30			1
' i 'm 101 % that he should have done what he did except for the things that he did before , ' she said , referencing @entity2 's decision to follow the teenager in his car and , fatefully , get out of the car and confront him			2
' when the end came to the end , he was justified in shooting @entity11			0
' he started the ball rolling , he could have avoided the whole situation by staying in the car , but he wanted to do good - he had good in his heart , he just went overboard			2
' while @entity2 himself never took the stand in his own defense , video recordings of him explaining the situation to police after the fatal shooting were submitted , effectively giving him the chance to tell his side without leaving himself open to a cross examination			0
cleared : the juror said that she felt that @entity2 went above the bounds of what he should have done but ' his heart was in the right place ' their side : @entity186 and @entity187 spoke out for the first time in an interview taped on monday , saying that they fear for their son 's life that was no matter for the juror : i 'm sure there were some fabrications , enhancements , but i think pretty much it happened how he said it happened			1
' initially this unidentified female juror was planning on writing a book about her experience on the trial - and even had a literary agent lined up early monday afternoon - but after the first portion of her interview was aired that evening she and the agent decided not to follow up			2
the second portion of @entity7 's interview was aired on tuesday , and she went into more detail about how two specific tact used by the prosecution may have influenced the outcome			1
breaking out in riots : protests throughout the country , including in @entity220 ( pictured monday ) mayhem : a group of protestors try to tear down a fence in @entity220 where the demonstrations turned violent on monday night and many were arrested throughout her interview with @entity30 , the woman regularly referred to the neighborhood watchman as @entity2 , and though she did call the 17 - year - old @entity11 , she admitted that she felt more personally connected to @entity2 as opposed to @entity11			0
' @entity11 was n’t as well known to us because there was n't as much said about him , ' she said			2
@entity30 brought up the fact that the two legal teams took very different visual approaches when making their closing arguments , with the defense holding up a concrete block like a portion of the sidewalk to show what they contend @entity11 used to attack			0
on the opposite end , the prosecution held up the @entity245 bottle and a bag of @entity247 , saying that was the only thing he was armed with			0
' the @entity247 and the @entity251 can were ridiculous to even compare it to , ' she said			0
@entity11 's materials : assistant state attorney @entity254 held up the @entity247 and @entity255 that @entity11 had on him at the time of his death , saying that was all he was armed with hard hitting : by contrast , defense attorney @entity259 held up a piece of the concrete sidewalk that he argued @entity11 used to bash @entity2 's head ' i believe he hit his head on the concrete , i believe he was trying to slam it ... it was definitely enough to make you fear ' i hope ( @entity2 's ) family can live a normal life after a while			1
i do n't know how he 's ever going to do that			1
' yesterday it was revealed that the first vote that the six - woman jury took behind closed doors came as a draw , with three wanting to acquit , one ready to charge him with second degree murder and two for manslaughter			2
in today 's segment , she made it clear that after hours of discussing the case and the evidence , the group had shifted to be five in favor of acquittal with one hold out			2
' i wanted to find him guilty of not using his senses ... you ca n't charge him with anything because he did n't do anything unlawful , ' she said			1
juror @entity7 went on to sob while saying that she wanted to apologize to the @entity11 family for the tragedy that they had to go through , but she also had a message for @entity2 and his family - after it was revealed yesterday that his parents have been in hiding as well as the former neighborhood watchman and his wife			1
' i hope his family can live a normal life after a while			0
i do n't know how hes ever going to do that			2
