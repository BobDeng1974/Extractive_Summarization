for one unfortunate gambler , saturday 's extraordinary round of @entity2 results will be remembered for all the wrong reasons			1
the punter had placed a £ 10 accumulator bet with a bookmaker on five games , with the odds stacked so heavily against them they would have taken £ 1million had it been successful			1
but as @entity14 came from behind to beat @entity15 , @entity13 went down 2 - 0 to @entity16 , @entity12 slipped to a 2 - 1 defeat against @entity18 and @entity19 beat @entity20 2 - 1			2
@entity21 ( centre ) celebrates scoring as @entity14 beat @entity15 3 - 2 at @entity23 's @entity24 scored as @entity16 beat @entity25 champions @entity13 2 - 0 if @entity28 's @entity27 had beaten @entity29 and both sides scored , the bet would have been won @entity31 tweeted a picture of the betting slip before @entity29 drew 0 - 0 with @entity27 the odds of all five results occurring were so high , the gambler was given odds of a 1,000,000/1			1
here is how close he came : @entity40 : @entity14 to beat @entity15 result : @entity14 3 - 2 win @entity40 : @entity16 to beat @entity13 result : @entity16 2 - 0 win @entity40 : @entity18 to beat @entity12 result : @entity18 2 - 1 win @entity40 : @entity19 to beat @entity20 result : reading 2 - 1 win @entity40 : @entity27 to beat @entity29 , both sides to score result : 0 - 0 loss four out of five results had , unbelievably , come in			1
the only game remaining was saturday 's late kick - off at @entity49 where @entity29 faced championship side @entity27			1
a victory for @entity28 's team , with both sides hitting the back of the net , was all that was required for the most astounding of bets to have landed			0
and the customer clearly felt their luck was in , as they rejected a £ 15,000 offer to cash - out before proceedings began at @entity49			0
agonisingly , there was not enough magic left in the cup for @entity27 to emerge victorious			0
the game finished 0 - 0 , with the unfortunate gambler left stunned at would could have been won			0
the bookmakers , meanwhile , breathed an almighty sigh of relief			0
@entity72 ( left ) denies @entity73 ( right ) from scoring as the punter 's bet was denied @entity77 's ( second right ) refusal to be beaten dashed the gambler 's hopes of winning an amazing bet but the punter was not left staring at their slip for too long , pondering what they would have spent the money on			0
@entity31 , the bookies in question , have given the punter four free bets of £ 1000 for every prediction that was correct while also inviting them to the @entity2 final .			2

a punter placed a £ 10 bet on five results that would have won £ 1million
four came in , *including* @entity13 losing to @entity16
saturday 's late kick - off between @entity29 and @entity27 saw him lose the bet
but they still got *rewarded* with four free bets and an fa cup final invite
