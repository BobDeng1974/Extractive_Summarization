a football fan has triggered a furious row after posting a picture of two @entity4 men praying at a @entity6 stadium and labelling it a ‘ disgrace ’			2
@entity9 tweeted a picture of @entity11 and @entity12 worshipping on their knees in a stairwell of @entity18 ’s @entity17 ground			1
he added the caption : ‘ muslims praying at half - time at the match yesterday # disgrace			1
’ fury : @entity9 took this photograph of @entity11 and @entity12 praying at @entity17 last month mr @entity9 ’s post , made after @entity18 took on @entity26 in the @entity27 last month , was met with widespread condemnation on social media , with users branding him a ‘ bigot ’ and ‘ disgrace to humanity ’			1
the tweet was reported to police , who investigated but decided no criminal offence had taken place			2
they have referred the matter back to the club			0
last night , @entity18 promised to take ‘ appropriate action ’ against the supporter			1
it is not known if mr @entity9 is a season ticket holder , but he could have this revoked or be banned from future matches			1
yesterday mr @entity11 , 46 , a solicitor from @entity47 , told the @entity48 that it was not the first time he had prayed at a match			1
backlash : @entity9 tried to defend himself by saying that he was a long - standing fan of @entity18 ‘ it only takes a few minutes and this time it was during half - time that we needed to pray , ’ the lawyer said			1
‘ we have a small window in which to pray			0
that day , the time came for prayer and the window would have closed before the game finished so we did it at half - time			1
campaigners have called for football clubs to install prayer rooms so @entity4 fans can pray in peace and avoid the possibility of @entity69 abuse			0
@entity70 , who runs @entity72 hotline tell mama , suggested that stadiums should have a ' multi-faith prayer room ' in their stadiums			0
he told @entity77 : ' we are aware of incidents where practising @entity4 have been abused since they have decided to quietly pray in public areas during half - time breaks			1
' given that people want to peacefully pray , we would suggest that clubs consider making a prayer room available for those fans who want to do so			0
' the prayer room just has to be a space that is clean and where people can spend about 10 minutes praying and which is available through the match			2
' it also can be listed as a multi-faith prayer room so that other faiths who want to use it , can do so			0
' currently both @entity26 and @entity95 have prayer rooms at their stadiums for the use of fans			0
the rooms are non-demoninational and can be used by fans of any religion , but are more likely to be used by @entity4 because they must pray at fixed times during the day			0
@entity104 has also built a prayer room at its training ground because there are a number of @entity4 footballers playing at the club			2
' most people are absolutely fine with it and the stewards at @entity17 are wonderful , but it only takes one or two people to react in the wrong way and you could have a nasty situation			1
’ @entity4 are required to pray five times each day – between dawn and sunrise ; at midday when the sun passes its highest point ; in the late afternoon ; just after sunset ; and around nightfall			0
because prayer times are based on the movements of the sun they differ from place to place			0
@entity18 ’s @entity27 quarter - final against @entity26 kicked off at 4pm , meaning mr @entity11 and mr @entity12 had to say their afternoon prayers at half - time , as the window of opportunity closed before the end of the game			1
mr @entity11 , whose eight - year - old son @entity139 can also be seen in mr @entity9 ’s photo , added : ‘ my little boy said at the time “ someone is taking a picture of us ” and i thought maybe it was someone who had n’t seen prayers before			1
i certainly did n’t expect to be called a disgrace for doing it			0
‘ but this guy was n’t abusive to us and the support since has been very nice , i ’m thankful			0
‘ i ’ve supported @entity18 for 40 years and i used to be a season ticket holder			2
from what i understand this guy does n’t live too far from the ground and is probably a boyhood fan , so i would n’t want him excluded from the ground or anything			2
‘ he should be given a talking to and made to go on an awareness course or educating			0
’ mr @entity12 , 37 , who is also a solicitor , said he would happily meet with mr @entity9 to explain the importance of prayers in @entity165			1
he added : ‘ education is key to stopping things like this from happening			0
maybe the man who took the photo has not come across @entity4 before who have explained the significance of prayer			0
i would be quite happy to meet with him to explain why we pray and when it needs to be done			0
’ in a statement , @entity18 said discrimination would not be tolerated at the club and it would ‘ take appropriate action against the individual involved ’			1
in 2013 , a group of @entity182 supporters were abused by onlooking fans because they were praying behind the main stand at @entity185 during a match			2
match : the incident took place when @entity18 were playing @entity26 at @entity17 in march			1

@entity9 photographed @entity11 and @entity12 praying during half - time at @entity17 last month
he captioned the image : ' muslims praying at half time @entity196 '
@entity18 now say they will take action against @entity9 over the post
but mr @entity11 says he does *n't* want to see @entity9 banned from the ground
