@entity1 are pocketing even more expenses than they were before the 2009 scandal – with many putting family members on the payroll , figures showed yesterday			1
taxpayers last year funded a record £ 103million of allowances			0
in 2008 – the year before the expenses scandal broke – the figure was £ 102million			1
part of the increase is down to a rise in the number of mps employing relatives and business associates on the public payroll			1
some 168 parliamentarians – more than a quarter – listed wives , children and even parents on their expenses returns last year , costing taxpayers more than £ 4million			1
this is up 8 per cent on the 155 who did so the year before			0
critics say the perk – which five cabinet ministers also take advantage of – allows politicians to increase their household income at the expense of the @entity47			0

@entity52 paid one aide a ‘ reward and recognition ’ payment of £ 2,000			0
fellow @entity36 @entity57 paid out a series of bonuses adding up to £ 1,950			0
last night @entity60 of the @entity61 ’ @entity59 said : ‘ taxpayers will be deeply concerned that the cost of @entity64 is going up again			0
@entity65 specifically pledged to reduce the cost of politics after the excesses of the expenses scandal , and politicians must be held accountable for their promises			1
‘ combined with the ever - increasing number of peers in the @entity74 , that promise looks increasingly difficult to keep			0
justice secretary @entity76 employs his wife @entity77 ( left ) as an office manager on £ 35,000 - £ 40,000			1
@entity36 mp @entity52 ( right ) paid one aide a ‘ reward and recognition ’ payment of £ 2,000 @entity1 @entity81 and @entity82 both lost their seats in @entity84 after fiddling their expenses ‘ there ’s nothing wrong with employing family members if they ’re qualified for the job , but there needs to be total transparency whenever that ’s the case			1
’ the bill for @entity1 ’ expenses rose by 5 per cent last year , but @entity33 says that once inflation is taken into account , the expenses total is lower than the pre-expenses scandal peak			1
the organisation added that it had saved more than £ 50million for the taxpayer since it was set up			0
the surge in family employment reflects a rule change that allows mps to spend more on staff and , by using relatives , to top up their household income			1
in 2011/12 , they were allowed to claim only £ 115,000 a year for staff			0
but that was increased in 2012/13 to £ 144,000 for @entity112 mps to reflect higher costs in the capital			2
other mps claim up to £ 137,000			2
the public outcry over mps employing family members began in 2008 , when @entity36 mp @entity119 was accused of paying his two sons for non-existent jobs			2
calls for the rules to be changed intensified after the expenses scandal broke a year later			2
last year ’s £ 103million expenses total consists of £ 81million on staff , £ 11million on accommodation , travel and subsistence , and £ 11million on office costs			1
the biggest claim was by the @entity133 ’s @entity132 , whose total spend was £ 229,262 , including more than £ 38,215 on travel reflecting the cost of getting to and from his @entity138 constituency , and £ 12,126 on hotels			2
@entity33 chairman sir @entity141 said the system was saving money compared to the discredited regime that led to the expenses scandal			1
he said : ‘ as part of our system of regulation , we have reduced the cost to the taxpayer by £ 58million			0
such is the progress made since the scandals which came to light in 2009 , our work is attracting the attention of parliaments around the world			0
’ five cabinet ministers – @entity159 , @entity76 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 – have family members on the public payroll			0
a spokesman for @entity33 said : ‘ the two figures are not truly comparable , due to the impact of inflation			2
