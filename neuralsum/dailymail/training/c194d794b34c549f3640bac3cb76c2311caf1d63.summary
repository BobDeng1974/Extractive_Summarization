what do @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 have in common ? they all swoon over the @entity5 at @entity6			1
this week , @entity7 has featured the superstar koalas at the popular attraction			1
despite sleeping for 85 per cent of his day , these mellow marsupials still manage to hang with more stars than @entity13			2
i saw @entity2 run through the entire zoo before he got to the koalas , just to get there in time to have his photo taken , ' says @entity41 , the zoo mammal keeper			1
' we had @entity42 , who was ecstatic and giggly to see our koalas			1
we 've also had @entity44 from the rock front , who were just as excited and they were just lovely when they came in			0
' so what is it that magnetises @entity51 icons to these koalas ? maybe between all the meet - and - greets and exclusive nightclubs , celebs want to hang with someone who can help them unwind			2
few animals know how to relax like the @entity21			0
@entity7 also explored a day in the life of @entity59 , an adolescent koala who sleeps for 20 hours a day			1
baywatch star @entity62 , who zookeeper @entity63 says ' ran through the entire zoo before he got to the koalas , just to get there in time to have his photo taken ' a koala in the enclosure snaps a selfie from a motion sensor camera inside the koala enclosure @entity41 says the koalas job is ' just to sit there and look cute ' ' some people think he might be a bit sloth like , but that 's just a typical @entity78 says			1
