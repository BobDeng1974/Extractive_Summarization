by @entity0 ' not what was intended ' : @entity3 's justice spokesman @entity2 , said the @entity4 were having too much influence in the @entity6 @entity3 finally admitted yesterday that its controversial @entity7 has left @entity6 ’s courts ‘ dancing to the tune of @entity10 ’			1
after years of doggedly defending the legislation , shadow justice secretary @entity11 admitted the need for significant changes			1
in future , he said , @entity6 ’s own @entity15 should normally be given the final say in appeals instead of the remote @entity19			1
mr @entity2 added that @entity6 judges would no longer have to obey every edict although they would still have to consider rulings by the court in @entity10			1
the intervention was seen as a blatant attempt to snatch votes from the conservatives , who are poised to unveil long - awaited reforms to human rights laws			0
@entity32 @entity31 said mr @entity2 ’s comments amounted to the first admission by @entity3 that the @entity7 had caused mayhem			1
@entity36 , who has campaigned for reform , said : ‘ after years of denial , @entity3 admit their @entity7 has skewed our justice system			1
‘ frankly , they should be on their knees apologising to the @entity6 public for the damage done			2
’ @entity3 was in power in 1998 when the @entity7 was passed , enshrining the @entity47 into @entity6 law			1
since then , the measure has been blamed for blocking the deportation of countless illegal immigrants and foreign criminals as judges have slavishly adhered to @entity10 case law			2
mr @entity2 said this had not been the original intention			1
he pledged that a future @entity3 government would issue new guidance to stop ‘ the sovereignty of our courts and the will of @entity62 ’ being called into question			2
‘ i want @entity6 courts to be clear that they do n’t have to dance to the tune of @entity10 , ’ he said			1
‘ that ’s not what was intended when the legislation was drafted and debated in @entity62 in 1998			2
‘ it ’s not good for our own domestic system of justice to be totally bound by what goes on at the @entity19			2
too often , rather than “ taking into account ” @entity10 rulings and finding their own way , our courts have acted as if these rulings were binding on their decisions			2
’ under the plan , people would still be able to take their appeal cases to @entity10 but @entity6 courts would be able to disagree with what the @entity19 said @entity3 admit its action would do nothing to resolve the thorny issue of @entity10 ’s ruling that prisoners should have the vote			1
officials said the case , which dates back to 2005 , is ‘ too far down the line ’			0
mr @entity2 insisted that the party ’s plans did not alter ‘ @entity3 ’s unswerving support for the @entity7 ’			1
justice secretary @entity95 said : ‘ this is just gesture politics and will do nothing to deliver the real change this country needs			0
’ before mr @entity2 ’s admission in an article in @entity104 , shadow ministers had repeatedly defended the legislation			1
in 2011 , mr @entity2 said : ‘ the act is the most significant defence for ordinary people against state power ever passed into law			1
‘ when @entity32 ministers blame the @entity7 , it ’s usually an excuse not to sort out the problem or a cover for their own failing policies			0
’ as justice secretary in 2008 , @entity117 said he could understand public concerns but blamed a few ‘ nervous ’ judges			2
yesterday , the @entity121 reported the latest controversial judgment made under the @entity7 ’s @entity123 , the right to a family life			0
judges ruled a nurse from @entity127 who force - fed her baby to death can not be deported after serving her three - year sentence			0
ministers have vowed to appeal			0
review : @entity132 suggested that licence fee alternatives should be looked at alternatives to the licence fee should be examined when the @entity137 ’s charter is renewed in 2016 , said @entity132 yesterday			0
the comments of @entity3 ’s deputy leader are the first sign of possible cross-party support for an end to the £ 145.50 annual charge			0
miss @entity132 , who is also shadow culture secretary , said : ‘ the licence fee is a means to an end , it ’s not an end to itself			0
‘ it ’s not easy to see what would be better but that does n’t mean it should n’t be looked at			0
‘ what we are not up for is a kind of ideological attack on the @entity137 because it is a public sector broadcaster			0
’ in an interview with @entity158 , she also urged culture secretary @entity159 to appoint a @entity161 chairman to replace @entity162 on an impartial basis			0
earlier , writer @entity164 suggested the @entity137 could become a subscription tv service like @entity166 .			0

justice spokesman @entity11 said @entity6 should have final say in appeals
comes after years of doggedly defending the legislation
mr @entity2 said @entity6 judges should not longer have to obey every ruling
though he said the courts should still ' take into account ' @entity179 law
