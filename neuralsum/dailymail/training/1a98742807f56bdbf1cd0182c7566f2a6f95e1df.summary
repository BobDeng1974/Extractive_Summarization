those who fear 3d - printed plastic guns take note : a @entity4 man has demonstrated that a deadly firearm can also be made completely out of items available from airport retail stores			1
web developer @entity8 of @entity9 , @entity10 moonlights as a ' security expert ' and can make projectile weapons with things like hairdryers and @entity15 -- all of which you can get after you make it through security			1
while he has an airport crossbow , blowgun , and spiked club , it 's @entity8 's hand - built gun -- which he calls his @entity25 -- that seems most worrisome			1
‘ i just do n’t think anyone ’s ever taken the time to do it			0
’ @entity8 , who attended @entity41 and earned a degree in digital media , says he embarked on the startling project after airports began to introduce body scanners			2
‘ it just seemed so invasive , really expensive , ’ he said			0
‘ and if you ’re going to go through all that trouble getting into the terminal , why is all this stuff available in the terminal ? ’ to @entity8 , whose speaking engagements include hacker conferences across @entity55 and abroad , that stuff equaled a disturbing possibility			2
@entity57 : @entity8 says he got the idea to when he realized he could buy lithium batteries , which cause a hot chemical reaction when combined with water			2
' if i wanted to build something very potent , i would probably go toward lithium , ' he says aromatic : the lithium and water create enough heat to blow up a 1oz can of @entity15 so he began tinkering with the range of seemingly innocuous items available in airport shops that line the terminals on the wrong side of security			0
and he found that not only was he able to create a gun , but he could also make a range of potentially deadly weapons , all of which he demonstrates on his website @entity82			1
‘ if we 're trying stop a terrorist threat at the airport , ’ says @entity8			2
‘ it 's already too late			0
’ @entity87 ! the can of axe body spray explodes in a cloud of fire serious business : using a handful of change as the projectile , the gun @entity8 dubs a @entity25 blows a hole larger than a quarter in a drywall target moonlighting : @entity8 works with computers by day but calls himself a ' security researcher ' by night , which is when he tinkers with his airport weapons at his home in @entity10 the idea for his @entity25 gun came to him after he realized airports sell lithium batteries			1
when mixed with water , that lithium can create enough heat to turn a can of @entity15 into aromatic ammunition			0
combine it with a hollowed out hair dryer , some gossip magazines and other sundries and you ’ve got yourself a gun			1
‘ right now if i wanted to build something very potent , i would probably go toward lithium , ’ says @entity8			2
his @entity122 demonstrations show his diy gun propelling a handful of pocket change powerfully enough to blow a quart - sized hole though @entity127			0
in an effort to win some research funds — and shield himself from unfriendly investigators — @entity8 notified the @entity132 , @entity133 , and other agencies of his activities prior to posting them on the internet			0
‘ it would have been awesome if i ’d had access to , like , a cockpit door , ’ he says			0
@entity8 continues to tinker away at his airport terminal weapons and tells @entity35 he has a stun gun and others in mind already			1
getting medieval : @entity8 also found a way to make a crossbow out of airport items			1
a @entity149 grabber is hand - operated robotic toy claw			0

@entity8 can make a gun comprised of a hair dryer , *magnets* , batteries , *hairbands* , and other items purchased at terminal stores
the @entity4 web developer demonstrates how to make his gun , as well as a crossbow , blowgun , and other weapons on his @entity166 website @entity82
