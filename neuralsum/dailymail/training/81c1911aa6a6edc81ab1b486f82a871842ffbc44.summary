@entity0 last night spoke of his anguish when he feared his wife @entity2 might have been killed in the 9/11 attacks on @entity4			1
in an interview to mark the 10th anniversary of the attacks , the prime minister warned that @entity18 had ‘ lost some of our moral authority ’ in the way it responded – with controversy still raging over the war in @entity11 and allegations of complicity in torture			1
but he also recalled his own personal torment on the day @entity22 struck , when he spent hours trying to contact @entity2 , who had flown to @entity23 on a business trip the previous day			1
concerns : @entity0 with wife @entity2			1
he has told how he feared she had been killed in the 9/11 attacks mr @entity0 was at the family home in @entity28 on the day of the attacks while @entity2 , who was two months pregnant with their first son @entity30 , was in @entity4 opening a new branch of the upmarket stationers @entity34 , where she still works as a consultant			1
the way they were : @entity0 and @entity38 pictured in 2000 although she was in the shop a few miles from the @entity41 , she was unable to tell her husband she was safe for five hours because the phone and mobile networks went into meltdown in the immediate aftermath of the attacks			2
in an interview with the @entity50 satellite broadcaster @entity51 , mr @entity0 said : ‘ @entity2 was actually in @entity4 that day , in @entity23 , and i ’ll never forget the hours of ringing her mobile over and over again and not being able to get through because the mobile phone system was down			1
‘ i remember exactly where i was when i finally did get through and how pleased i was to hear her voice			0
‘ and it made a huge impression on her because of what happened in @entity4 that day and what people felt about it			2
' obviously it ’s been one of the defining events of this century			0
and i think we ’re still coming to terms with it and trying to get our response to it right			0
’ mr @entity0 defended his decision to vote for the @entity72 , but said ‘ mistakes ’ were made in the way the @entity74 responded to the threat from @entity22			2
he said : ‘ we can certainly see with hindsight , and in some ways at the time , mistakes were made in that we lost some of our moral authority , which is vital to keep when you ’re trying to make your case in the world			1
’ @entity38 had flown to @entity23 on a business trip the day before the twin towers were hit the prime minister said the insistence on a @entity91 resolution on @entity92 , the establishment of an inquiry into allegations of torture and the controversial decision to pay tens of millions of pounds in compensation to 16 @entity100 terror suspects with @entity18 links , were all evidence that the @entity103 was working to restore @entity18 ’s moral standing			1
@entity105 claims @entity18 ' had lost some of our moral authority ' in the way it responded top 9/11 he said the decision to settle the @entity100 cases out of court was designed to ‘ remove the stain from @entity18 and to make sure that our security services could get on with their work ’			1
mr @entity0 said he would stick to the deadline to withdraw all @entity18 combat troops from @entity118 by the end of 2014 , just before the planned date of the next general election			1
and he said the @entity74 had to focus on preventing @entity22 establishing a stronger foothold in ‘ badly fractured ’ states like @entity124 and @entity125			0
but he insisted the events of the @entity128 springe were a ‘ hugely optimistic and hopeful moment for our world ’			0
meanwhile , @entity131 yesterday backed ‘ regime change ’ in @entity136 and @entity137 – as he warned the @entity74 still faced a major threat from terrorism 10 years after the 9/11 attacks			2
the former prime minister said the threat posed by @entity141 extremists would take a ‘ generation of effort ’ to defeat			0
mr @entity131 , who remains unrepentant about the bloody aftermath of the @entity72 , conceded that the @entity74 had underestimated the scale of the threat it faced from @entity141 extremists			0
he said that although only a tiny number of people were directly involved in terrorist attacks , the number sympathetic to @entity22 ’s message was ‘ worryingly large ’			2
he added : ‘ the majority , as the @entity155 shows , want what we want			0
but the minority are well organised and very determined and they are not confined to the ranks of suicide bombers			0
’ but @entity163 ’s former foreign secretary @entity162 took a swipe at the ‘ war on terror ’ waged by mr @entity131 in alliance with @entity167 in the wake of the 9/11 attacks – saying the words should and he suggested the @entity72 had done more harm than good , adding : ‘ i have to recognise that list of positives including @entity174 gone , @entity175 safe - but outweighed by the longer list of negatives			0
