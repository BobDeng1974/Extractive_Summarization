to many of her women colleagues , she is a heroine for winning a landmark ageism case against the @entity4			1
the efforts of @entity6 , however , appear to have been lost on the younger @entity7			0
the two women , both former presenters of @entity9 , have become involved in a row after @entity11 disputed that the 57 - year - old had been a victim of age discrimination on the show			1

miss @entity16 called @entity11 an ' a * * e licker ' in a rant online miss @entity7 – nicknamed ‘ the walking man ’s crumpet ’ for presenting many outdoor programmes for the @entity4 – said in a saturday newspaper interview that miss @entity6 ’s departure from @entity9 in 2009 was simply a result of planned changes to the show ’s format rather than discrimination			1
miss @entity7 said : ‘ i ’ve been through millions of programme changes where they say , “ sorry , love , we ’ve changed the slot ”			1
it happened with watchdog – they brought @entity36 back			0
‘ with @entity6 , the decision certainly was n’t made because she was old			0
the decision was because they were changing the programme			0
’ the comments infuriated miss @entity6 , who sent @entity11 a series of messages on @entity48			2
she wrote : ‘ so you know better than three judges in a legal case and former @entity54 [ director general ] @entity50 who accepted the tribunal decision ? ‘ before you make ill - informed statements i suggest you look at the legal case – one day you might need it			0
until then good luck with the a * * e licking			2
’ miss @entity7 did not respond to any of the tweets , and yesterday friends said she wanted to maintain a dignified silence			1
miss @entity6 told the @entity66 she believed miss @entity7 was simply voicing the defiance of senior producers on @entity9 , whom she claims have refused to accept the employment tribunal ’s 2011 ruling			1
she added : ‘ it really is a pathetic thing to say			0
she has just made herself look rather silly			0
i think it displays a certain arrogance			0
‘ if she had studied the tribunal judgment , and it is online , she might have a different view			0
but it was an ill - informed view and not helpful to her or other older women in television			0
frankly i feel there was some a * * e licking there			2
’ at the tribunal @entity81 said she had been devastated when she was told in november 2008 that she was being dropped from @entity9 after eight years of working for the sunday lunchtime show as a freelance			2
