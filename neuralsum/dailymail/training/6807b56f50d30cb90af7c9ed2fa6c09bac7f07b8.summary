out of a job ? @entity1 is the co-chairman of @entity2 , and may lose her job over emails leaked online in the recent company hack			1
pictured above at the @entity7 premiere of film the interview for calling @entity13 ' despicable ' and being involved in an email exchange describing @entity11 as a ' spoiled brat ' , @entity1 may lose her job			2
@entity14 has been an awkward place for the 56 - year - old @entity2 executive ever since hackers released hundreds of company documents online - including her candid show - business emails			1
the hack is thought to be a response to the release of @entity2 film @entity24 , which makes fun of @entity28 leader @entity27			1
the group believed to be behind the attack has ties to the @entity28 regime			1
and it seems the hack is doing the destruction the group envisioned , as sources told the @entity37 that @entity38 could be getting sacked for comments made in the private emails			1
' @entity1 will be getting fired to set an example , ' the source told the @entity37 on saturday			1
' everyone is really upset because @entity1 is beloved and a good person			0
' the anonymous source went on to say that @entity38 's previously stellar reputation made the emails all the more surprising , and have damaged the company as a whole			1
one of the most offensive comments made by @entity38 in the emails , was in reference to president @entity54 's film preferences			2
in an email exchange about what she should talk to the president about at an event , she asked ' should i ask him if he liked @entity62 ? ' before going on to list other movies about slavery			0
for that racially - insensitive comment , @entity38 issued a public apology to the @entity67 and had to humble herself in a phone call with the @entity70 - who has become the president 's private adviser on civil rights issues			1
' she kept saying over and over again that â€™s not who she is , ' @entity70 told the @entity37 about his chat with @entity38			1
' she apologized over and over			0
but i told her that when i listen to the words , if they were said by somebody of another race about somebody of another race , they would not be tolerated			0
' and the president is n't the only one offended in her emails			0
@entity38 also takes shots at @entity87 and @entity11			2
@entity13 was one of the main @entity89 actors trying out for a role in the studio 's planned biopic of @entity93			2
payback : the hack was believed to be carried out as retribution for @entity2 releasing @entity24 , a movie mocking the @entity28 regime and starring @entity98 ( left ) and @entity99 ( right ) it seems @entity101 was offered the role first but turned it down , with producer @entity104 emailing @entity38 about the actor 's ' horrible behavior '			1
@entity38 agrees , calling @entity13 ' actually despicable '			2
she was also involved in a nasty exchange of words concerning actress @entity11			0
the actress was insulted in an email exchange between @entity38 and producer @entity111 , as the two got into an argument over whether director @entity114 should work on the @entity93 biopic or a @entity117 movie starring @entity11			2
@entity111 , who bought the script to the studios , wrote : ' @entity120 before she makes it very hard for @entity121 to do jobs			0
' popular producer : before the hack , @entity38 had a good reputation in @entity14 , which made the candid emails all the more surprising			0
pictured above with @entity127 ( left ) and @entity128 ( right ) @entity38 then hit back : ' do not f * * king threaten me			0
i have been asking you to engage with me on this for weeks			0
' to which @entity111 responded : ' what the hell are you talking about ? who 's threatening you ? let me remind you i brought this material to you and i can off her from it in a phone call			0
do n't for one second even think about trying this s * * t with me			0
' ' there is no movie of @entity117 to be made ( and how that is a bad thing given the insanity and rampaging spoiled ego of this woman and the cost of the movie is beyond me ) and if you wo n't tell her that you do not like the script - which , let me remind you , she does n't either - this will just spin even further out into @entity153 but let me tell you i have zero appetite for the indulgence of spoiled brats and i will tell her this myself if you do n't			0
' @entity38 awkwardly had to face @entity11 last week when the two attended the annual women in entertainment breakfast			0
if looks could kill : @entity38 has an awkward embrace at a recent breakfast after emails sent to her called @entity11 a ' spoiled brat ' however , @entity11 has since pulled out of promoting her new @entity2 - produced movie unbroken , about an @entity168 olympian taken by the @entity169 as a prisoner of war during @entity171 , citing a chicken pox infection			1
@entity11 even released a picture of herself , sores and all , but @entity2 executives say the illness is made up to spite @entity38			1
other @entity2 secrets revealed in the hack , was the company 's plans for a @entity187 remake , the entire script for the new @entity179 movie and the salaries for actors like @entity98 and @entity99 .			1

@entity189 told the @entity37 that the @entity2 co-chairman will be fired to ' set an example '
@entity38 's emails were leaked online in @entity2 hack , thought to be carried out by group with ties to the @entity28 regime
in the embarrassing and sometimes racially - insensitive emails , @entity38 offended actors like @entity13 and @entity11
