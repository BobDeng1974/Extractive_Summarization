@entity0 dislikes plus - size models and wants overweight people to pay the @entity3 to treat any health problems resulting from their size @entity0 strikes fear into the hearts of many people in the @entity9 - she recently came second in a poll of the world 's most hated people			1
but her latest battle - to shame people into losing weight - has virtually made her a social pariah			1
the television star 's new documentary , which sees her gain and lose three stone in six months , has made her so disliked among larger ladies and men that they actively try to avoid her			1
the mother - of - three told @entity26 : ' fat people can be quite afraid of me , there is this sort of @entity31 fear			1
' a lot of them will actually cross the road to avoid me if they see me walking down the street			1
' others will present me with their excuses before i have even opened my mouth , which is weird because it 's not like i go around judging me all of the time			0
fat mums completely avoid me , but that ’s fine			1
' @entity0 has had a bee in her bonnet about overweight men and women for a couple of years			2
last year she made headlines around the world after she revealed that she would n't hire a fat person because they are ' lazy '			2
so in the last six months , the 39 - year - old decided to put on 30 per cent of her body weight in just three months and then lose it just as quickly , to prove that larger people only have themselves to blame for piling on the pounds			2
the star has very little time for larger people , admitting than she can hardly bear to touch anyone carrying a little extra fat , but she has even less for their excuses			1
instead of laying the blame for @entity9 's obesity problem at the door of the takeaway shops and junk food companies , @entity0 says it is the fault of the individual and they need to be aware that it is not okay to look as they do			1
the documentary @entity0 : my fat story follows @entity0 as she gains 3st on a mammoth diet of 6,500 calories a day , then loses the weight through a healthy eating plan and exercise @entity0 said : ' at my heaviest during this television experiment , i weighed 12 stone			1
' nowadays , i hear a lot of women say 12st is n’t that big - they say that because you can be 12 stone and a size 14			2
' but it 's strange idea that we think 12st is n’t that big , i actually find it very alarming			0
@entity0 wants her @entity94 documentary to start a debate about the nation 's obesity crisis ' we keep pushing up the boundaries , first of all 10st was n't that big , then 11st and now 12st			1
' i really worry about the re-sizing that we have done as a nation			0
' by putting size 16 models in @entity105 shop windows and embracing bigger seats , bigger beds and bigger geriatric ambulances - we are re-scaling what we perceive as normal			1
' but while @entity0 thinks the plus - size models in @entity105 shop windows are unacceptable , the super-skinny mannequins that recently caused an uproar in @entity113 are acceptable in her eyes			1
she said : ' i do n’t mind skinny mannequins			0
' i did n’t think that they were particularly skinny , i thought that they pretty alright			2
' there are a lot of kids at that age who are relatively skinny			0
i was a pretty skinny kid			0
' in terms of sizing , @entity123 starts their plus - size collection at a size 12 and i ’ve always said that size 12 is a size called fat			1
' because for me , it ’s not necessarily that a size 12 is fat , it ’s so that people can have a sense of what is normal			1
' i believe that we take our cues on what is normal from what we see on the high street and as we are getting bigger , we are just re-sizing or super-sizing what we think is normal			0
' @entity0 's approach to weight loss is five parts stick , zero parts carrot			2
asked about a fat tax as a potential solution , making customers pay a heftier tax on junk food than healthy produce , @entity0 scoffs and suggests a far more radical option			1
the controversial figure claims that while she did n't shed a tear at her wedding or the birth of her children , gaining 3st pushing her weight over 11st ' killed her ' and left her in constant floods in part two of @entity0 's documentary , airing saturday , she debates diet bloggers and plus - size campaigners she says : ' i ’m not averse to the idea of a fat tax , but i would go much more brutal than that			1
' i think the fact that we do n’t own our problems in this country is the biggest issue that we have			0
' for instance , our nhs in this country is free at point of use , but most people perceive that as completely free			0
' therefore , any problem that they create with their body is also free , with someone else footing the bill			0
' @entity0 's approach to weight loss is five parts stick , zero parts carrot she continued : ' obese people are bankrupting us - they cost us something like £ 17.4 billion last year			1
' we need to make these people own the problem			0
so , we should have a social security insurance scheme , whereby people are charged if they do n’t make a genuine effort to look after their own health			0
' if you do n’t look after your own health , guess what ? you ’re going to pay more			0
so if you smoke , guess what ? you ’re going to pay more			0
you drink too much , guess what ? you ’re going to pay more			0
' and if you eat yourself into being morbidly obese , then you ’re going to pay for your hip operation as well			0
' that would make people own their problems better than some kind of fat tax			2
' because this tea and sympathy lark just is n't working			0
' the first episode of @entity0 's new two - part documentary @entity0 : my @entity212 airs tonight on @entity94 , with the second programme coming out tomorrow evening			1
in half a year , @entity0 went from 8st 12lb to 11st 13lb and then lost the weight again to prove how easy it is to get fit			2
the journey was all captured on camera			0
@entity0 : my @entity212 , airs friday and saturday , 2 and 3 january at 9pm on @entity94 .			2

@entity0 is so vocal on obesity that people now avoid her in street
new documentary star thinks super-skinny shop *dummies* are ' alright '
she dislikes plus - size models and wants fat people to pay for @entity3
