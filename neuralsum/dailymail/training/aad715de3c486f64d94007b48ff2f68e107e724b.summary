@entity0 started out as a kind of sanctuary for @entity3			1
a means of escape from the playground bullies who took exception to his change in appearance after the first of two heart transplants			1
he was 12 at the time and the drugs he needed to stay alive , to accept the heart that had come from a 15 - year - old girl killed in a car accident involving a drunk driver , had caused certain side - effects			1
‘ i gained a lot of weight , my face became really bloated and i grew facial hair that meant my eyebrows met my hairline , ’ said this extra-ordinary @entity22 professional			1
determined look : @entity3 is looking to win his first major at the @entity31 this month ‘ i was like “ @entity32 ” ( a well - built tv host in the @entity34 ) and some of the kids at school did give me a hard time			1
i ’d gone from being this athlete with @entity41 blond hair to someone who was called “ @entity43 ” for two years			2
’ in the end , this softly spoken 34 - year - old had to change schools			1
but it was golf that provided him with peace and solitude			2
‘ @entity0 was an escape from some of the things i had to deal with , but the people around me were also proud that i was out there doing something , ’ he said			2
after being diagnosed with viral cardiomyopathy at nine and having a transplant three years later , golf was also one of the few outdoor sports his body would permit him to do			2
rough time : 34 - year - old @entity66 has had two heart transplants it was n’t easy at first			1
he would have to get special permission to use a golf cart in competitions because even walking the course was difficult			2
but he had talent , and as he grew stronger his game improved			2
but even today , following a second transplant six years ago , @entity3 has to pace himself carefully			1
no sooner had he walked off the course here at @entity79 after a very tidy 18 holes with sir @entity81 than his caddie , @entity82 , was passing him a pill along with his watch and his wallet			2
‘ it ’s my blood pressure tablet , ’ he explained			0
on monday he started out with the intention of playing just nine practice holes , but the thrill of being invited by @entity81 to join him on the course kept him out there for the full 18			0
hanging tough : @entity3 was bullied at school due to his physical appearance from his heart conditions ‘ i have had blood checks , and the results in the last couple of weeks are better than they ’ve been in years , ’ he said			1
‘ i rested up before this by having a couple of weeks off so i actually feel great right now			0
’ sadly , it ’s not always the case , which is what makes @entity3 ’s story , and the fact that he is enjoying a career that enables him to provide for his wife and daughter in @entity108 , all the more remarkable			1
‘ if i withdrew from every golf tournament i play in when i ’m not feeling well , i would n’t finish half of them , ’ he said in a recent interview			1
‘ that ’s why i always give it a shot because sometimes i do start to feel better			0
but it does n’t always happen that way			0
some days it gets worse			0
’ some days it gets seriously bad			0
before his last transplant he suffered a heart attack , and just about got himself to hospital and called his parents — fearing he might never speak to them again			1
here in @entity79 this week the outlook is rather more positive			0
he talks candidly and courageously about the challenges he will face when his third heart runs out of steam — the first one lasted 16 years — but he would rather focus on playing well in his first @entity31 , and perhaps even securing a spot on the @entity22 @entity132 team later this year			1
eyes on the prize : @entity3 hopes to play well in his first @entity31 tournament and even gain @entity132 selection ‘ absolutely , that has to be a target , ’ he says of breaking into @entity138 ’s team			1
‘ just because i came second in the @entity141 does n’t mean i ’m going to play well here			1
but i think my game suits this course			0
' it will demand that you create some pars but i think i ’m good at that			1
at the same time , though , this is my first @entity31 here and i will learn a lot this week			1
’ he will learn with the intention of coming back for many years to come			0
‘ there are a lot of things they can do now , and hopefully in the next 10 or 15 years things would have moved on again in terms of medical science , ’ he said			0
‘ hopefully , i ’ll be healthy enough to benefit from that			0
and hopefully people , other transplant recipients , will benefit from seeing how i ’ve lived my life			0
’ big decision : @entity3 hopes to impress @entity22 @entity132 captain @entity138 at the @entity31 in that sense he is an inspiration — living proof that a heart transplant does not have to stop you from becoming a professional sportsman			1
‘ i ’m not any more special than any other transplant recipient , ’ he said			0
‘ that ’s why people have to keep a close eye on me			0
‘ but if this heart lasts as long as the first one it should definitely allow me to keep playing competitive golf for as long as i want to			2
and then after that , well who wants to be old b * * * * * * s like you guys anyway ? ! ‘ for me , though , it ’s about more than that			0
realistic : @entity3 hopes his current heart will enable him to play competitive golf for as long as possible ‘ i was heading to the driving range here when i met a lady who was with her son , who has a heart issue			1
he must have been three or four years old and i picked him up so that we could have a photo together			0
‘ they were excited , and for the parents of kids like that i think it ’s good			2
‘ look , if anything happens to me i do n’t care			0
but it ’s the people you leave behind ; those around you who are affected			0
they are the ones giving the medication to their kids			0
it ’s very hard on families			0
’ he only hopes those families take some comfort and encouragement in seeing him play golf this week			2
tough competitor : @entity3 came second at the @entity141 at @entity215 in june @entity216 aiming for prizes not points			1

@entity3 aims to have a *successful* tournament at the @entity31
it will be the @entity22 *'s* first appearance at the major
@entity3 has had two heart transplants with the first at age 12
golfer was bullied at school because of his condition
@entity3 hopes a good @entity31 showing will boost @entity132 chances
34 - year - old came second at the @entity141 in june
