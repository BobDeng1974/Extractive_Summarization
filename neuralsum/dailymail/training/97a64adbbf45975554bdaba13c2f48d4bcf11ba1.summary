by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 02:16 est , 14 june 2013 it 's a tradition going back a quarter of a century , but really not one where you want to spill the red wine			2
thousands of foodies dressed from head to toe in sparkling white converged on @entity10 last night to quaff champagne and eat fine foods together as the annual diner en @entity14 celebrated its 25th birthday			1
diners , who had signed up for the event were kept in the dark as to the location of the giant dinner party right up until the last minute , but were told to make their way to either the @entity22 or the grounds of the @entity24 via email earlier in the evening			1
diner en @entity14 : people , all dressed up in white , have a dinner on the @entity29 in front of the @entity31 in @entity10 all white : diners also gathered at the @entity24 to celebrate the 25th birthday of the @entity26 en @entity14 tradition that has now spread worldwide celebration : diners have to dress head to toe in white and bring a picnic table and white table cloth to the event come dine with us : more than 15,000 people were expected to attended for dinner but only invited guests are allowed a seat within the hour , row upon row of picnic tables - complete with white table cloths - were set up , wine was uncorked and revellers began sharing food at the spectacular event			1
guests enjoyed their dinner against the backdrop of the @entity31 and the city 's most iconic museum until midnight , when they pack up their rubbish and leave			0
the tradition began in 1988 when a group of ten friends decided they wanted to eat at a forbidden spot in the @entity67 capital			0
but they ended up dining as a 200 strong flash mob at the @entity71 , a favourite spot of @entity67 royalty including @entity74			0
@entity75 : diners were only told the venue of the ' flashmob ' dinner by email shortly before dinner started and within an hour , thousands had descended within their tables eat to the beat : a band entertains diners who ate @entity75 in the shadow of the @entity31 last night fine dining : guests wore all their finest white clothes , brought china plates and bottles of champagne to toast diner en @entity14 's birthday packed in : tables were arranged in rows with men supposed to sit on one side and women seated on the other and guests can only be seated once everyone in their row has set up their table since then the event has gone global with versions of the dinner taking place in @entity111 cities such as @entity112 and @entity113 and much further afield in more than a dozen locations in the @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and even @entity118 and the @entity119			1
the craze finally made the short journey from its @entity10 home across the @entity123 to @entity124 only last september when thousands of diners converged on the @entity126 of @entity127			2
but the @entity10 version remains the tradition 's definitive one			0
each year the guest list exceeds 15,000 say organisers and past dinners have taken place at such illustrious settings as the @entity136 , the grounds of the @entity31 , the @entity24 and the @entity138			2
be our guest : the grounds of the @entity24 have hosted the diner en @entity14 event in the past , which started when a group of friends wanted to dine in a forbidden area in 1988 opulent : the square at the centre of @entity10 's most famous museum provided a magnificent backdrop for those who arrived to eat at this year 's dinner trendsetter : one woman bucks the trend by accessorising her white outfit with a bright pink hat as guests decide where to set invite only : guests at both venues would have either had to have attended the last @entity10 event or been invited by someone who did those on the guest list will have either attended the previous year 's event or been invited by someone who did			1
everyone who is invited must bring a guest and arrive by public transport			1
guests must bring a picnic table , a picnic basket , foldable cheers and a table cloth - all in white of course			2
men and women sit on opposite sides of the table to one another and guests are forbidden to sit down until their entire row have set up their table			0
and if you are invited , do n't let a double booking or inclement weather put you off - if you fail to turn up or do n't abide by the events rules then you wo n't be invited back			0
no excuses : diner enjoyed good weather for the event , but should n't be deterred by inclement weather - if you fail to turn up and are on the guest list then you are blacklisted from future events			0

diners celebrated the 25th year of the diner en @entity14 tradition at the @entity22 and @entity24 in @entity10 *tonight*
@entity202 is by invite only and guests are only told the illustrious location an hour before dinner starts
they must arrive by public transport , bring a guest and be dressed all in white with a picnic table , wine and food
