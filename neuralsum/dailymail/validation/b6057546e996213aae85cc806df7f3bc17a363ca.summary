the newborn child of murder - accused @entity2 teenager @entity1 was rushed to a prison clinic today after falling ill in her mother ’s @entity6 prison cell			1
just one week after the child ’s birth in an @entity15 hospital , baby @entity8 - named after miss @entity1 ’s co-accused boyfriend @entity9 - developed a high fever and her dark skin took on a yellowish color in the cell , which her mother shares with eight other prisoners			1
the little girl was hurried into the clinic , which is located within the prison walls , and given immediate treatment by doctors			0
but it was the yellow appearance of the baby ’s skin that was causing the greatest worry			2
with miss @entity1 being concerned about the child ’s health , doctors told guards at @entity27 that she wanted her boyfriend , who is being held in the men ’s section , to be present in the clinic while the baby was being treated			1
this was allowed and , according to sources , miss @entity1 and @entity9 held hands while doctors attended to the child			2
@entity9 had first set his eyes on his baby daughter on monday afternoon after his girlfriend returned from the @entity59 , where she gave birth to the baby via caesarian			1
he was escorted by guards to miss @entity1 ’s cell where , in a tearful meeting , he held his daughter in his arms , tears running down his face			2
trial : @entity71 ( left ) and her boyfriend @entity9 ( right ) , both from @entity73 , are accused of murdering @entity71 's socialite mother @entity74 , 62 , and hiding her body in a suitcase at an upmarket @entity6 hotel women sharing miss @entity1 ’s cell also gathered around mother and child , but miss @entity1 has been warned that their congratulations could turn to anger if the baby wakes them up with her crying night after night			1
‘ keeping the baby in a humid , unclean cell , where prisoners sleep on the floor , is hardly the place for a newborn baby , ’ said a @entity6 resident who visits the jail regularly			0
‘ adults get sick in there , so what chance does a newborn have ? ’ victim : miss @entity1 with her late mother @entity74 , whom she and her boyfriend @entity9 are accused of murdering reports from a jail source say that the baby will be kept in the clinic under observation while her mother remains in her cell			1
but if the child , born a few weeks prematurely , does not improve within the next 48 hours she will have to be returned to hospital			0
‘ there seems no doubt that the baby needs pretty intensive treatment , ’ said the jail visitor after talking to prison officials			0
‘ it may be that she will have to be returned to hospital within a few hours			0
’ the drama surrounding the baby ’s health was being played out on the day that miss @entity1 and @entity9 were due to return to court for the continuation of the murder charges against them			2
they have been accused of killing miss @entity1 ’s 62 - year - old socialite mother , @entity124 , from @entity73 , in the upmarket @entity125 in @entity6 ’s seaside @entity128 district			0
@entity9 has admitted hitting her with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self - defense while his girlfriend has been accused of helping him to force the body into a suitcase , which was then loaded into the boot of a taxi they had ordered			1
the three judges who were due to hear the case were informed that the accused couple would not be available due to the baby ’s health			0
the case was adjourned and is expected to resume next week			0
but while miss @entity1 faces ongoing concerns about the baby ’s condition and the prospect of being sentenced to death if she is convicted of her mother ’s murder , she is understood to be under pressure in another direction			2
@entity9 ’s mother , @entity153 , visited miss @entity1 in hospital and , after setting her eyes on the new - born baby , is understood to have begged miss @entity1 not to take the child back to the prison with her			1
but as events have shown , that is what she did - but if the baby ’s condition does not improve she will be sent back to the hospital again .			0
