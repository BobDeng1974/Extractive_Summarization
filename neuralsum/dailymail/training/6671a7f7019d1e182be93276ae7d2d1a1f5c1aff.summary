by @entity0 @entity1 netted twice to provide @entity3 head coach @entity2 with a first victory – but it might not be enough to keep him in the side for the weekend			1
the 22 - year - old @entity8 forward , borrowed from @entity10 side @entity9 , struck twice in the first half to give the @entity13 club breathing space against their @entity16 opponents			1
and they needed it as @entity19 roared back following @entity1 's substitution to a standing ovation late on			1

after securing progress to the second round of the @entity73 , @entity2 confirmed @entity3 hope to complete a trio of deals – @entity77 striker @entity76 and @entity80 centre - back @entity78 joining permanently , and another @entity9 player @entity81 on a season - long loan – on wednesday			1
' if they pass their medicals and sign contracts then we can discuss them , ' he said , cautiously			2
' but we have been really close to some signings and they have fallen through for whatever reason so i do n't want to talk about people until they are my players			0
' @entity1 eased @entity92 into a 2 - 0 interval lead with a couple of classy strikes			1
first , he controlled @entity97 international @entity28 's low cross to fire in from the edge of the box			0
then , latching onto academy product @entity33 's teasing through ball , he switched the ball to his left foot to curl in the second on the run seven minutes before the break			0
' he did n't do himself justice on saturday at @entity108 , he was a rabbit in the headlights , ' @entity2 said			0
' but he looked impressive tonight			0
the thing about him is he 's got potential and my definition of potential is that you have n't done anything yet			0
' @entity117 's @entity19 re-emerged with greater purpose , and an altered formation , at the start of the second period and went close just four minutes when @entity58 's header looped over			2
but he did find the net with his next effort as he poked in from close range late six minutes from time			2
when @entity28 departed for his reckless tackle , silence enveloped @entity128 but @entity3 ran down the clock to ensure @entity131 's first win since replacing @entity132 at the helm			0
' i am happy we are in the next round , that 's what this was all about and we have achieved it , ' @entity2 added			2
' in the first half we showed glimpses of our potential but the second half was a reality check that we are a work in progress			0

@entity1 scored his first goals for the @entity151 side as they advanced through to the next round
late @entity58 goal a mere *consolation* for the *visitors*
@entity76 expected to sign for the @entity13 side in the coming days
