@entity0 pauses , stutters and makes several false starts before deciding he ca n’t bring himself to do it			1
‘ i ’m not going to give him the satisfaction of paying him a compliment , ’ he says			1
‘ i could easily give him one but i do n’t want to			1
@entity8 has no respect for me so why should i show him any ? ' @entity0 and @entity8 first clapped eyes on each other seven years ago at a weigh - in at the @entity12 in @entity13			1
@entity0 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) come face - to - face during the weigh - in in @entity16 on friday @entity17 had to intervene as tensions again spilled over between the pair ahead of their fight on saturday @entity8 poses at the weigh - in ahead of his bout with @entity0 on saturday evening at the @entity23 arena @entity0 looked focused during the build up to the fight in @entity16 twenty four hours later , on the undercard of @entity29 ’s career - defining unification victory over @entity30 , they each continued their ring education with routine wins			1
they did not meet again until may 2011 when tempers flared at a press conference to promote their first fight			2
@entity8 , who had accepted the challenge at 48 hours ’ notice , failed to make the weight and had to stew for another five months before he could attempt to wrest @entity0 ’s light - heavyweight world title			1
he lost by majority decision in front of his home crowd in @entity16 but the itch remained unscratched and the bitterness allowed to fester			1
a devastating knockout defeat to @entity47 last year saw @entity0 move up to cruiserweight where he was soon joined by @entity8 , ensuring a rematch was inevitable			1
each has had two warm - up bouts to prepare for their return to a sold - out @entity54 on saturday			1
@entity0 ( left ) said ' there is a lot of hate involved ' in his relationship with @entity8 ( right ) @entity0 prepares for a workout with trainer @entity60 in his gym in @entity62 ahead of his bout @entity8 ( right ) in action as he puts the finishing touches to his preparations ahead of the fight with @entity0 @entity0 is looking to repeat his victory over @entity8 back in 2011 ‘ there ’s a lot of hate involved , ’ admits @entity0			1
‘ we can market the fight as good v bad because i ’m going about it the right way and he ’s shouting his mouth off			1
‘ but for boxing as a whole , and for sportsmanship , it ’s bad			2
there ’s no place for it in the game			2
it does n’t need that level of hostility			2
he goes past the point of professionalism and takes it one step too far			2
‘ he wants to hurt me and he wants to end my boxing career			2
he wants me gone from the sport because i ’m in his way and stopping him moving ahead			2
he wants to inflict as much damage as he possibly can , there ’s no doubt about it			2
but i ’m going to deny him that because i ’m a better fighter			2
’ @entity0 , 27 , might be more subtle about his dislike for his opponent but is equally determined to settle the matter			1
‘ i need to silence this guy once and for all , ’ he says			1
‘ he ’s just there in the background , annoying me			2
he keeps opening his mouth , whinging and moaning and being disrespectful			2
‘ it ’s like being back at school			2
i used to like challenging myself and i got into a lot of fights and i would always aim for the guy who was bigger ; the bully boy			1
@entity112 ( centre ) splits up @entity0 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) before their previous fight in 2011 @entity0 ( left ) emerged victorious on that occasion and is confident of winning again ‘ i ’d set myself a challenge to take down the one who was loud , who was aggressive ; the one who had that boldness			1
@entity8 is the same , he ’s a bully boy			1
he ’s a big guy , he ’s got a big mouth and he tries to bully people			1
‘ but i ’ve always said that in any walk of life , the way you beat a bully is to stand up to him and i stood up to @entity8			1
i ’ve taken him down once and i ’ll take him down again			2
‘ he does n’t like me because i ’m his big rival and i ’m in his way			2
i ’m the reflection of what he wants			2
‘ i was @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and world champion and he wanted those belts			2
we were both promoted by @entity112 , we were both at light heavyweight and he wanted my position and he could n’t have it			0
he hates me for that because i was denying him his opportunity			0
‘ i ’ve already beaten him once and he ’s still bitter			0
’ on the top floor of a quiet commercial gym in the @entity145 valleys , @entity0 has just finished his day ’s training			1
later he will pound the pitch - black streets , alone and in his element			0
even the sound of a solitary gym goer ’s skipping rope brushing the floor is beginning to irk			0
‘ i do enjoy my own company ; in the gym and in life in general , ’ he reveals			0
‘ it ’s important to do that , it ’s where i get most of my constructive work done			0
it ’s where i learn the most			0
@entity0 does pad work as he prepares for saturday 's grudge match with @entity8 @entity0 is confident of beating @entity8 ( above ) and described him as ' bitter ' after his last defeat ‘ i have a lot of thoughts going through my head , i evaluate life and i evaluate my fights			1
i picture my next fight , what shots i ’m going to throw and how i ’m going to win			0
‘ i was brought up with one of my brothers but generally i liked my own company			0
that ’s why i entered a solitude sport like boxing			0
’ after his crushing defeat to @entity47 , @entity0 split with his dad @entity181 who had trained him since 2008 when his son left @entity184 ’s gym			1
after a brief spell with @entity187 ’s former coach @entity186 in @entity188 , @entity0 returned to @entity145 and is now trained by his former strength and conditioning coach @entity60 who operates as a one - man band			1
@entity0 says he likes his own company which is one of the reasons he got into boxing @entity0 broke away from being trained by his dad following his defeat by @entity47 @entity0 is now trained by @entity60 at his gym in @entity62 in @entity199 ‘ it ’s difficult changing trainer in any circumstance , father or no father , ’ reasons @entity0			1
‘ you build up a great bond with a trainer and there ’s a lot of trust involved but eventually good things have to come to an end			1
it was just time ; it ’s not the first case and it wo n’t be the last case of trainers and boxers going their separate ways			0
‘ i needed a fresh start and a fresh voice and deep down my dad understood that			0
we achieved an awful lot together and i ’ve got to pinch myself sometimes			0
we went on an amazing unbeaten run with a lot of knockouts			0
‘ i was living the dream but things change and we move on			0
we still talk ; we obviously do n’t see each other as much now but we still talk			0
‘ he has n’t been to my last couple of fights and we ’re going to stick to that for this one			0
he was involved in a training capacity before and obviously not being involved now , it ’s been difficult for him so i think it ’s best we keep the boxing separate			0
@entity0 poses as he is weighed at @entity239 before taking on @entity240 on saturday @entity0 is hoping to silence @entity8 ' once and for all ' when they step into the ring on saturday night ‘ it ’s hard being selfish but trying to please everyone gets you stuck sometimes			1
as i ’ve matured , i ’ve had to do what ’s best for me			0
‘ i learned a lot from @entity186 but i was away from home and away from my comfort zone			0
the training was excellent but it was the location which did n’t work for me			0
‘ as a fighter i ’ve got to be true to myself and if something is not working , i ’ve got to change it			0
‘ i trust myself to do what ’s best for me			0
‘ @entity60 has been part of the team for a long time			0
he ’s honest , and i trust him			0
‘ he has a good work ethic and he ’s in the sport because he enjoys it , not because he has to be			1
he wants success ; the trust issue is a big factor			0
he ’s a good friend as well			1
’ @entity8 holds up some inflatable sheep thrown by the crowd at the weigh - in on friday @entity0 is hoping to silence @entity8 ' once and for all ' when they step into the ring on saturday night @entity0 , too , remains in the sport by choice			1
given the nature of his first career defeat in which he was knocked down twice before the referee spared him any further punishment in the fourth round , and his degree in maths , he could be forgiven for choosing a different path			0
‘ i ’ve got such a good academic brain and i could have a comfortable life outside boxing , ’ he says			1
‘ i could turn my hand to many other things but it ’s boxing i ’ve decided to do and to stick to because i ’ve worked too hard to just throw in the towel ; i ’ve come too far			0
‘ i ’m on the verge of big things again so to throw it away at this stage would be a real shame and something i could never forgive so for me it ’s about giving it another crack and going to get another world title			0
that ’s my goal and that ’s what i ’ve set out to do			0
’ these days , when @entity0 bumps into those playground bullies , there is a knowing smile and a shake of hands			1
will he afford the same respect to @entity8 ? ‘ no , i do n’t think so			1
i think too much has been said now			0

@entity0 will take on @entity8 in @entity16 on saturday
@entity0 and @entity8 have fought before and @entity0 was victorious
@entity0 compares @entity8 to a bully and wants to silence him for good
