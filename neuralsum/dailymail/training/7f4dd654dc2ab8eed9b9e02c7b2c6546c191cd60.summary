by @entity0 published : 06:20 est , 3 august 2012 updated : 04:22 est , 10 august 2012 this is the man who wrote - off a video showing a group of @entity6 children being tortured as ' @entity8 propaganda ' , happily walking the streets of @entity10			1
expensively dressed and clutching his briefcase dr @entity13 is no usual pedestrian , he is the father - in - law of hated tyrant @entity16 and apologist for his brutal regime and its atrocities			1
@entity13 , whose daughter @entity20 is married to the @entity6 president , was probably on his way to work as a cardiologist on @entity10 's exclusive @entity24			1
apologist : the father - in - law of brutal @entity6 president @entity16 , dr @entity13 , has been spotted walking down a @entity10 street looking down as he strolled the quiet @entity28 street , he then jumped into a luxury @entity30			1
@entity31 said that he has not been seen in the area since may but he reappeared this week			0
earlier this year a series of explosive emails showed that he was backing his tyrant son - in - law and what he was doing to his own people			0
he has also defended the regime publicly in an interview			2
in correspondence to @entity16 , signed off with ' warmest ' , he rubbished @entity42 worries about the number of deaths in @entity6			2
he also branded the @entity46 hypocrites for taking action to stop @entity49 protestors , and torture in @entity52 and @entity53 jails as well as setting out a 13 - point critique explaining why criticisms of @entity16 's regime were wrong , calling it the ' direct the argument toward the other side			2
' off to work : @entity13 gets into his @entity30 and was perhaps off to @entity24 where he works as a cardiologist couple : @entity63 , left , is @entity13 ' daughter , and is married to @entity6 leader @entity16 , right denials : the cardiologist has defended the actions of his son - in - law , revealed in e-mails and interviews he has given @entity70 : a funeral of 35 victims of shelling in the town of @entity74 , near @entity75 , shows the scale of violence in the country astonishingly he also compared the @entity6 uprising to the @entity10 riots and claimed the use of armed force against the people of @entity85 was justified because lives were at stake – and after all , @entity88 had threatened to use the army against rioters			1
‘ when the @entity10 riots burst out and mr @entity88 said he would get the army out , now would you compare that to @entity85 ? ' he said in an interview			0
‘ what would you do ? just watch them killing you ? you have a responsibility to ensure the security of your people			0
’ it was then pointed out to him that the riots in @entity10 had been quelled without the authorities killing anyone , to which dr @entity13 , co-chairman of the @entity104 , replied : ‘ we are not as sophisticated as the @entity107 or @entity108			1
’ he went on to tell the @entity109 that the death toll in @entity6 of 7,000 was ‘ much better ’ than the @entity112 one , which some rebel reports put at 50,000			0
@entity115 down : @entity117 not been seen at his @entity28 home since may until he turned up this week , neighbours said it came as @entity8 said it is set to increase its support for @entity6 opposition forces in their fight against the nation 's brutal dictator @entity16 , @entity119 revealed today			1
but the cash boost will only come in the form of ' non-lethal ' support - including the training of citizen journalists to ' get the word out ' about the atrocities			0
it will not , however , involve sending armaments to the beleaguered rebels , the @entity8 foreign secretary added			0
' given the scale of death and suffering and the failure so far of the diplomatic process we will , over the coming weeks , increase our practical but non-lethal support , ' he said .			0
