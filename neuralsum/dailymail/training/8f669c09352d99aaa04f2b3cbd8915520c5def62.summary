by @entity0 published : 21:20 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 21:42 est , 25 february 2013 @entity2 has described it as proof ‘ i ’d better keep my day job			1
' according to @entity6 , it was ‘ just a great round of golf with @entity8 and @entity9			0
’ much has been made of @entity2 ’s @entity11 golfing weekend in @entity12 – from it 's cost to his questionable choices over his playing partners - but little has been reported about the questionable background of @entity18 donor @entity17 who hit the links alongside the president and @entity6			1
@entity2 and the ‘ boys ’ – among them @entity6 , @entity25 trade representative @entity24 and @entity26 owner @entity17 - have done their best to downplay the trip			1
like @entity6 said , it was ‘ just a great round of golf			0
’ no doubt for him it was			0
but there is no such thing as ‘ just a round of golf , ’ for @entity17			1
from @entity40 house to @entity41 : @entity2 back at work after his ' boys weekend ' in @entity12 @entity26 owner , @entity17 at the @entity45 , 2012			1
a man with his eyes on the future ... and a distinctly murky past @entity6 is a more eye - catching choice of presidential golf - partner with his dazzling skill and whiff of personal scandal			2
but dig a little deeper and @entity56 , 58 , is arguably the more interesting , and controversial , of the two			0
this is a man who was named best ceo golfer in the world and promptly had himself removed from the rankings because , ‘ nobody likes to be tracked and traced			0
. you may not want people to know wherever you ’re at			0
’ this is a man who advised his salespeople to , ‘ get somebody out of their element , out of that boardroom			0
. in a golf cart , ’ because , ‘ if you ca n’t sell something in four hours , you ca n’t sell it			0
’ this is a man whose company ’s business practices have been the subject of several investigations , costly legal suits and eye - watering settlements and whose own methods have drawn excoriating criticism			2
playing the game : @entity17 and his wife @entity87 are generous sponsors of sports and the arts as well as political donors			2
this is a man who does n’t slice shots he cuts deals			0
his partner on the course was @entity98 , chairman of utilities company @entity100 and , along with @entity17 , boardmember of @entity102			1
superficially , of course @entity17 's presence makes sense			1
for a start the @entity106 owns the @entity40 where the men played			0
@entity2 and his group , which included @entity111 friend @entity110 rented out all eight of the club 's private cottages , with his security detail spilling over into many nearby hotel @entity116 there ’s the fact that since 2002 @entity17 has been an active and generous democratic donor and fundraiser			1
last year he gave the maximum $ 5,000 to @entity2 ’s campaign and $ 30,800 to the @entity122 ( @entity122 )			1
in 2010 he gave to the @entity18 @entity106 candidate , @entity123 , with $ 125,297 in donations			2
but before 2002 , when he began pouring his money into @entity127 coffers , he was a similarly generous @entity129 donor			0
his contributions included $ 5,000 to the @entity131 , ( @entity131 ) in 2000 and several to candidates including former @entity106 senators @entity133 and @entity135			2
back then , @entity17 was ceo of @entity136			2
he built the freight company and with it his fortune			1
inspite of intense interest in the president 's golfing weekend and game with @entity6 , the weekend was off - limits to photographers the @entity40 opened in 1996 - a year later @entity17 's company was under @entity149 investigation focused on relaxation : @entity2 is an avid golfer who met @entity6 in 2009 but president 's weekend was the men 's first game together			1
@entity155 wrote that at the root of all ‘ fortunes without apparent cause , ’ is ‘ a crime forgotten			0
’ @entity17 ’s personal wealth is in excess of $ 500million and his history is long			1
his path to building his wealth is punctuated with charges of racial and sexual discrimination , profiteering from the war in @entity168 and breaches of fiduciary duty			1
in 1997 @entity56 ’s company , @entity171 , was investigated by the @entity149 ( @entity149 )			0
according to the lengthy report published by the commission @entity17 ’s company paid , ‘ female and minority employees less than white men who do similar work ; did not investigate employee complaints of sexual harassment ; and destroyed evidence that the company was instructed to retain as part of the two - year @entity149 investigations			1
’ while @entity2 golfed @entity183 took to the slopes at @entity186 ski area , @entity187 , @entity188 she was joined by daughters @entity190 and @entity191			2
two hundred and three cases were upheld			0
@entity136 ’s general counsel , @entity193 testified against the company and was later sued by them for revealing privileged information			0
it was reported in the @entity198 that @entity17 instructed executives not to employ ‘ blacks because once you hire blacks you can never fire them			1
’ as a boy @entity17 dreamed of owning a @entity203 and a @entity40			2
as a man he 's used to getting what he wants in 2000 @entity136 was forced to pay $ 9million in back - pay and damages			1
six years later the company was once again attracting official opprobrium – this time with allegations of war profiteering			0
in 2006 @entity136 paid $ 4million to settle a civil suit brought by the @entity212 alleging that the company had inflated the cost of military shipments to @entity168 , allegedly adding $ 0.50 per kilogram of freight from @entity217 to @entity218			1
they paid a further $ 300,000 in 2007 and $ 750,000 in 2010 to settle allegations of kickbacks			2
ultimately @entity136 paid a fine of $ 4,486,120 and fired two senior executives – conditions made by the @entity212 for dropping the case in which @entity136 was one of several companies charged with price - fixing shipments to @entity168			1
according to @entity17 the fault lay with ‘ two rogue executives ’ both of whom were sacked			1
as for those breaches of @entity234 , in 2007 @entity232 entered into a merger with @entity236 for $ 38 per share			0
but the deal quickly soured with @entity232 claiming that the @entity238 was ‘ the produce of a sham process , controlled and manipulated by @entity17 , with the tacit or express connivance of the remaining defendants ’ – among them @entity98 also on the president ’s recent boys weekend			1
@entity232 argued that @entity56 dominated and manipulated board members , excluded them from key meetings and with - held vital information			0
ultimately @entity56 cut ties from the company he founded and went onto set up @entity252			2
this is not a man who accepts defeat			0
though no doubt he took the president ’s win on the course in good grace			0
but then that was ‘ just a round of golf , ’ was n’t it ?			0

*multimillionaire* @entity26 owner , @entity17 , hosted the president 's *secretive* golfing weekend in @entity12
freight company he founded has paid millions in settling sexual and racial discrimination cases
@entity212 charges of price - fixing military shipments to @entity218 only dropped after executives were sacked and *multi-million* *dollar* fines paid
@entity17 accused of ' domination and manipulation ' of @entity280 for his own ' *significant* *financial* benefit '
@entity2 's ' boys weekend ' cost *tax* - payers an *estimated* $ *989,207*
