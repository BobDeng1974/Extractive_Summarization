the @entity1 ’s biggest sandwich maker wants to recruit hundreds of workers from @entity3 because no @entity1 will do the job			0
bosses from @entity6 are flying to @entity7 today in search of staff for its new factory			1
the firm , which supplies @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 ’s , @entity15 and @entity16 , admits it will have to recruit most of the 300 workers it needs from overseas			2
@entity6 ( pictured ) say they have failed to attract many applications from potential employees in @entity21 - so bosses are now travelling to @entity7 to recruit some of the 300 - strong workforce needed its vacancy crisis will re-ignite claims that @entity1 ’s generous welfare system has created a generation unwilling to work , while acting as a magnet for foreigners			1
@entity31 , @entity6 ’s human resources director , said the company had tried to recruit in the @entity1 , but that it was ‘ not always the kind of work ’ which people wanted to do			1
human resources director @entity31 ( pictured ) said most of the 300 new staff members will be recruited from @entity7 after generating little interest from locals the £ 35million factory , in @entity21 , is due to open in early 2016			1
mrs @entity31 said low unemployment meant few locals could be found to fill vacancies , although there are around 8,000 jobless in the town , a rate of 6.8 per cent – the national average – while in nearby @entity48 it is 9.5 per cent and @entity49 8.7 per cent			1
in @entity7 , the average wage is little more than £ 7,000			2
even if workers coming here were on the minimum wage , they would earn almost double that – £ 13,520 a year			0
and they would have their wages topped up with tax credits – seen as a major attraction for @entity60 migrants – and housing benefit			0
these mean a migrant with no dependants on the minimum wage has their net income of about £ 184 a week boosted to £ 254 , studies have suggested			0
for those with a partner and two children , that rockets to £ 543 a week , equivalent to a salary of more than £ 28,000			0
work and pensions secretary @entity72 has claimed that the last @entity74 ’s ‘ open - door ’ policy led to a huge influx of low - skilled migrant workers while its welfare system disincentivised @entity1 to work			2
conservative mp @entity78 said : ‘ this highlights why we have so many people coming here – because jobs are available and not everyone wants to take those jobs			0
@entity6 staff hard at work in one of their factories - but bosses are struggling to find people who want to work in its new £ 35 million factory in @entity21 , which is due to open in 2016 @entity6 's food to go business is one of the world 's leading manufacturers of pre-packed sandwiches people on benefits here should be willing to take any job			1
’ @entity6 is not the only company to go to @entity3 in search of workers			2
earlier this year , the @entity108 found @entity1 companies had placed almost 8,000 job adverts trying to recruit @entity112 nurses , taxi drivers and hotel staff .			0
