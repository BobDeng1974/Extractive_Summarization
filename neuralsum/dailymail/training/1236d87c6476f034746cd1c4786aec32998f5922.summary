he believes the prisoners behaviour to be disturbing , offensive and dangerous			2
one inmate revels in being in the slammed : ' between me and you , this s * * * ai n't half bad , ' burning down the house : it seems the prisoners can get away with virtually anything - here they burn a t - shirt in a cell contraband : cellphones are not allowed to be brought into jail , but once they are behind bars it 's not illegal to own one the videos show the prisoners taking drugs , smoking , hoarding snacks , giving each other tattoos , and in one photograph , burning clothes inside a cell			1

' anyone who sees those videos , they 're going to be sickened by it			0
they 're going to be angry , ' said @entity160 , executive director of @entity161 , an advocacy group for crime victims			0
the @entity164 team which conducted the original investigation found inmates using @entity15 not only to communicate instantly with family and friends , but also to talk to inmates in other prisons			1
the fear is that despite being off the streets , the criminals can still organise drug crimes and violent crimes			0
lighting up : a prisoner lights a blunt in the comfort of his cell on one occasion two inmates at different prisons contact one another by posting their phone numbers on each others wall			2
many of the families of the criminals ' victims have said they are outraged at the freedom the inmates are experiencing			0
the victims ' families said when the criminals were sentenced to prison , they never imagined them posting photos of themselves to @entity15 watching tv or burying themselves in junk food			1
plenty of possessions : this inmates cell looks more like the inside of a student 's dorm room with books , clothes and food all on display living it up : a prisoner shows the marijuana bags he has for sale behind the prison walls convicted murderer @entity214 , who killed @entity215 , posted pictures of his phone and holding $ 200 cash			1
