@entity0 showed his boss @entity2 just what he is missing by scoring as he took on the @entity4 team that he now co-owns with @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 and @entity8 in a fund - raising match that attracted a 12,000 crowd to the @entity11 in @entity12			1
the so - called ‘ @entity23 ’ of former @entity25 players have taken over the @entity13 and all five turned out as well as bringing their old team - mates from their schoolboy days to play a friendly , with @entity17 playing centre forward , to the amusement of the capacity crowd , who booed his name when the teams were read out			2
@entity26 travelled up from @entity27 to be assistant manager but it was the original youth team coach who honed the illustrious talents at @entity25 , who was managed the ‘ class of 92 and friends ’ for the night			1
former @entity25 players @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 all played , the latter two as subs , while former @entity68 cricketer captain @entity67 came on for the second half with fast bowler @entity70 on the bench			0
and @entity17 endured the indignity of being substituted for comedian @entity73 while former @entity68 fast bowler @entity70 came on 65 minutes , presenting something of an imposing presence at centre half			0

@entity120 ’s @entity119 did his career prospects at the club no favours by turning @entity84 one way , then then the other before landing him on his backside			0
in fact , the class of 92 were saved by @entity129 der @entity59 ’s impressive reflexes , with the 51 - year - old displaying age - defying agility to keep out @entity120 early on			2

@entity169 added a third for @entity120 on 52 minutes with @entity181 and @entity182 getting on the score sheet late on to make it 5 - 1 to @entity120			0
the closest the class of 92 came to a second half goal was a curling shot on 78 minutes from former @entity25 trainee and @entity190 player @entity189 that hit the post			2

' it 's for a good cause , it 's a great way of raising the profile and for keeping fit as well ' the new owners have ambitions of getting @entity120 into the @entity233 , and @entity6 - who , unlike @entity8 , is retaining a place on the @entity25 coaching staff along with @entity0 - said : ' we all have dreams			1
