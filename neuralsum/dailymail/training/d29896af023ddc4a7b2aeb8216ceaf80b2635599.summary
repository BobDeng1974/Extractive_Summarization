by @entity0 a @entity2 activist who called for all immigrants to be sent home is set to fight a key commons seat for @entity7 ’s party			1
the party is poised to name controversial @entity11 councillor @entity9 as its parliamentary candidate for @entity13 , which is narrowly held by @entity14			1
the move comes after @entity16 revealed how former @entity18 mrs @entity17 had been caught on camera calling for all immigrants to be repatriated , saying : ‘ i just want to send the lot back			1
last night , @entity14 said mrs @entity17 ’s selection would completely undermine mr @entity7 ’s boast last week that ethnic minority voters would be flocking to support his party			1
@entity14 mp @entity33 said : ‘ moves like this make a mockery of @entity7 trying to appeal to the ethnic minorities			2
‘ @entity2 people say one thing but do another			2
’ last december , this paper exposed how mrs @entity17 , described by a party insider as a ‘ @entity42 ’ for the way she was fast - tracked after defecting from the @entity44			2
she made the inflammatory comments on immigration after leaving the @entity18			0
in a 20 - minute video filmed in 2008 , she talked about restricting the number of foreigners coming in to the country , before saying : ‘ i just want to send the lot back but i ca n’t say that			2
’ @entity7 , pictured , held an election rally in @entity54 featuring black and asian supporters she added : ‘ we must basically repatriate those that should n’t be here			0
’ at the time , mrs @entity17 , 54 , claimed that her remarks had been taken ‘ out of context ’			1
now she is poised to be named as @entity2 ’s candidate for the marginal @entity14 seat of @entity13 – which she fought at the 2010 election as a @entity18			1
four years ago , she came within 714 votes of a shock victory against @entity14 veteran @entity66 , who is standing down next year			2
mrs @entity17 was unavailable for comment last night			0
however , earlier this year , she spoke openly about her ambitions to become an mp and denied any suggestion of racism in her remarks on immigration			0
@entity2 has been beset by a series of embarrassing claims by party members in recent weeks , including one who said comedian @entity77 should emigrate ‘ to a black country ’			1
but last week mr @entity7 used a rally in @entity54 with black and @entity81 party candidates to deny claims his party harboured racism			0
in a separate development yesterday , @entity2 switched tactics by launching a poster campaign to win blue - collar votes from @entity14 ahead of next week ’s @entity89 elections			1
the @entity91 party sought to mimic @entity95 ’s ‘ cost of living ’ campaign by claiming @entity93 membership put an extra £ 400 on @entity97 household food bills			0
the campaign , funded by @entity100 millionaire @entity99 , came amid @entity2 claims that it would now squeeze the ‘ soft ’ @entity14 vote in the same way it has attracted former @entity18 supporters			1
a party spokesman said the decision to switch the attack on to @entity14 was taken by mr @entity7 and key aides at a strategy meeting last week			0
the move was based on research showing that given the party had already ‘ eaten deep ’ into the @entity18 vote , traditional @entity14 supporters represented the ‘ biggest , softest ’ section of voters left to be squeezed in the final ten days of the @entity89 campaign			0
mr @entity7 said : ‘ despite these being @entity89 elections , @entity14 and @entity95 do not want to talk about @entity89			0
they have nothing to say apart from the fact that they wo n’t trust the people to decide if they wish to be governed from @entity122 or from @entity123			0
