two strange , bright flashes on the surface of dwarf planet @entity2 may have different origins , according to new infrared images released by @entity6			1
the images , captured by the @entity8 from 28,000 miles ( 45,000km ) away , show that a pair of mysterious spots on the dwarf planet have different thermal properties			1
the images were revealed as part of the first colour map of @entity2 , showing variations in surface materials , and revealing the diverse processes that helped shape it			1
the latest images are the closest taken yet , and suggest that the icy body was likely once fully active			2
images taken using blue ( 440 nanometers ) , green ( 550 nanometers ) and infrared ( 920 nanometers ) spectral filters were combined to create the map ' this dwarf planet was not just an inert rock throughout its history			1
it was active , with processes that resulted in different materials in different regions , ' said @entity39 from the @entity40 , @entity41			0
the ' alien ' spots on the surface , named feature 1 and feature 5 , show up in visible light images as bright flashes in comparison to the rest of @entity2 's surface			1
in infrared , region 1 is cooler than rest of surface , but 5 is located in a region that is similar in temperature to surroundings			1
last month , scientists said this pair of mysterious bright spots could be towering ' water volcanoes ' , but they said they need to take a closer look to confirm this			1
@entity64 , who works on @entity8 's @entity65 , presented infrared images of the two spots , measuring their thermal properties			1
' what we have found is that bright spot number one corresponds to a dark spot in the thermal image , ' he said at a press conference today captured by the @entity8 from 28,000 miles ( 45,000km ) away , the images reveal that two mysterious bright flashes on the surface have different thermal properties			1
the upper trio is region 1 at visible , infrared and thermal infrared wavelengths			1
at thermal infrared , the spot is dark - meaning it is colder than its surroundings			2
the lower trio represent @entity88			0
in thermal infrared , the spot disappears @entity8 observed @entity2 completing one full rotation , which lasted about nine hours			1
the images show the full range of different crater shapes that can be found at @entity2 ' surface : from shallow , flattish craters to those with peaks at their centers @entity2 is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt , making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system			1
@entity2 is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a ' dwarf planet '			0
scientists think @entity2 may have an ocean and possibly an atmosphere			0
it lies less than three times as far as @entity113 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform			2
the @entity8 spacecraft pulled into orbit last month around the @entity2 in the asteroid belt			1
the probe is currently on the dark side of @entity2 and wo n't emerge until april			0
there is high interest in the mission because @entity2 is one possible destination for human colonisation given its abundance of ice			2
but feature five , which appears as two separate bright spots next to each other in visible images , did n't show up in the infrared images			1
' spot number five shows no distinct thermal behaviour , ' he said			0
@entity8 is currently too far from its target to find out why this is the case , the scientists added			2
it may be due to having a different structure , or being made from different material			2
more detail will emerge after the spacecraft begins its first intensive science phase on april 23 , from a distance of 8,400 miles ( 13,500km ) from the surface , said @entity150 , investigator on the @entity8 camera team			1
the origins of @entity2 ' bright spots , which have captivated the attention of scientists and the public alike , remain unknown			0
' the bright spots continue to fascinate the science team , but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source , ' @entity39 said			0
recent images from the @entity8 reveal feature 5 at various angles as the asteroid rotates			1
the glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of @entity2 , suggesting that they must be high above the surface rather than at the bottom of an impact crater , as previously believed			0
' what is amazing is that you can see the feature while the rim is still in the line of sight , ' said @entity179 , a planetary scientist at the @entity180 in @entity181 , @entity182			0
@entity2 rotates in this sped - up movie comprised of images taken by @entity6 's @entity8 during its approach to the dwarf planet			1
the glimmers of light are visible even when they are near the edge of @entity2 , suggesting that are on a high elevation in relation to the rest of the surface the ' alien ' mark can be clearly seen in images the icy world as the @entity8 hurtled its way towards a rendezvous on march 6 he noted that at dawn on @entity2 , the spots shine brightly , but fade as dusk draws in			1
according to @entity203 , this could mean sunlight plays an important role in the formation of the features by , for instance , heating up ice just beneath the surface and causing it blast of in a plume			2
scientists have speculated that the interior of @entity2 is rocky with a layer of water and ice			2
the leading theory now for the alien spots is that the ice is covered by a thin layer of soil that at times forms into huge ' cryovolcanoes ' due to internal pressure in the asteroid			1
@entity2 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			0
in january , researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface at a rate of 13lb ( 6kg ) per second			0
' now , finally , we have a spacecraft on the verge of unveiling this mysterious , alien world , ' @entity8 mission director and chief engineer @entity232 , of @entity6 's @entity234 in @entity235 , @entity231 said			1
' soon it will reveal myriad secrets @entity2 has held since the dawn of the solar system			0
' @entity2 is the bright spot in the centre of the image			0
because the dwarf planet is much brighter than the stars in the background , the camera team selected a long exposure time to make the stars visible			0
the long exposure made @entity2 appear overexposed , and exaggerated its size a cropped , magnified view of @entity2 appears in the inset image at lower left @entity8 will be captured into @entity2 ' orbit in march , marking the first visit to a dwarf planet by a spacecraft ( artist 's impression pictured ) @entity2 orbits the sun in the asteroid belt between @entity266 and @entity267 and is very similar to @entity267 's @entity268 and @entity270 's @entity269 - both considered potential sources for harbouring life			1
the presence and abundance of water in bodies like @entity2 could have relevance for the origin of life on @entity113 and the large - scale migration of planets such as @entity267			0
one scenario suggests as the giant planets migrated they disturbed populations of small rocky and icy asteroids and comets which hit the early @entity113 and @entity289 - delivering organic molecules and water to @entity113			0
@entity2 is twice the size of @entity270 's geyser - spouting moon @entity291 which is suspected of having liquid water beneath its surface			0
it lies less than three times as far as @entity113 from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform			0
since launching in 2007 , @entity8 has already visited @entity302 , a giant protoplanet currently located 104 million miles ( 168 million km ) away from @entity2			2
the distance between @entity302 and @entity2 is greater than the distance between the @entity113 and the sun. during its 14 months in orbit around @entity302 , the spacecraft delivered unprecedented scientific insights , including images of its cratered surface and important clues about its geological history			2
@entity302 and @entity2 are the two most massive bodies in the main asteroid belt			0
@entity2 is 590 miles ( 950 km ) across and was discovered in 1801			0
in january , researchers discovered that water was gushing from its surface			0

images from @entity8 reveal the mysterious spots on the surface , named feature one and feature five , in infrared
feature one is cooler than rest of surface , but give is in a region that is similar in temperature to surroundings
leading theory for spots is that ice covered by a thin layer of soil is *exploding* due to pressure in the asteroid
