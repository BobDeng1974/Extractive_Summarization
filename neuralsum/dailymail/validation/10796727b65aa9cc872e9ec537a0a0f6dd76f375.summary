former cancer sufferer @entity72 , 87 , made threat to *cut* out sons
@entity8 , 60 , and @entity9 , 55 , did not *listen* to him when he told them to quit
they contested the will of their father from @entity26 , @entity27 , claiming it was only meant as a warning and was not his genuine wish
but the @entity38 ruled it was mr @entity5 's true will to disinherit them
