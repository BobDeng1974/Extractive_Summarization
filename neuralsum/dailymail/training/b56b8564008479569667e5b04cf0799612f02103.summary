from the use of ' coercion and threats ' to ' emotional abuse ' , this shocking ' checklist ' for dating women was posted on @entity6 by @entity8 ' pick - up artist ' @entity7			1
the diagram , featuring three sections entitled ' physical ' , ' violence ' and ' sexual ' , was originally designed by a domestic abuse charity to help women identify when they are being abused			1
however , the 25 - year - old uploaded it to his @entity6 page earlier this week , alongside the caption : ' may as well be a checklist â€¦ # @entity20			1
' the post , which has now been hidden online , came as @entity23 politicians urged the country 's home secretary @entity24 to ban mr @entity7 from coming to the @entity23			1
the ' dating guru ' has made a name for himself by being what he describes as an ' executive coach ' for the company , @entity47 , a so - called ' international leader in dating advice '			2
men from across the world pay as much as $ 3,000 each to attend seminars where he and his associates purport to teach how to seduce women			0
but last week , mr @entity7 was forced to cut a visit to @entity57 short due to widespread protests at his advice , which includes choking women , threatening to commit suicide and injuring their pets			1
' it 's unspeakable , ' @entity65 , a 32 - year - old @entity23 researcher based in @entity66 , who is a leading force in the ' @entity70 ' @entity69 campaign , told @entity71			2
' he 's inspiring people to commit an act that is criminal			0
and the misogyny is shocking			0
' under fire : the 25 - year - old 's techniques ' for picking up women includes choking them ( pictured ) , injuring their pets , threatening to commit suicide , and isolating them from their friends criticism : the businessman had to cut his recent trip to @entity57 short following widespread demonstrations mr @entity65 , whose @entity69 group taking on mr @entity7 has more than 9,000 followers , added that the ' pick - up artist 's ' seminars cross the line of free speech by inciting the audience to commit assaults			1
through his company 's work , mr @entity7 promises customers the chance to ' witness dating coaches attract beautiful women in live demonstrations '			1
but videos and pictures of the businessman in action suggest he encourages men to harass women with the aim of having sex with them			0
a video of one of his seminar in @entity112 shows him saying that ' white men ... can do what you want ' in @entity66 , suggesting that men grab women 's heads and thrust them towards their crotch			0
campaign : @entity65 , a 32 - year - old @entity23 researcher based in @entity66 , is a leading force in the ' @entity70 ' @entity69 campaign ( pictured ) , which has so far gained more than 9,000 ' likes ' speaking of mr @entity7 's planned trip to @entity23 , @entity23 crime minister , @entity123 , said she was ' extremely concerned ' by his ' sexist and utterly abhorrent ' comments about women			1
the @entity127 politician added : ' if he was allowed to perform in the @entity23 i have no doubt that cases of sexual harassment and intimidation would increase			2
' free speech is obviously hugely important , but with free speech comes responsibility			0
it is not appropriate to talk about choking girls under any circumstances			0
