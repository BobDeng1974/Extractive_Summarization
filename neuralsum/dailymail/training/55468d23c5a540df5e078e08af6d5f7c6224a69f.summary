' mr @entity10 believed @entity17 and even took her to @entity123 airport for her flight in june 2010			2
but she then refused to return and asked for her son , @entity70 , to join her			0
when she finally returned home , @entity17 claimed she had made a mistake and begged for the company director to take her back			2
it was a pattern that would repeat itself many times over , as she continued to pay her long - term partner against her @entity43 lover			1
the deceived businessman also said @entity17 often used sex as a ' weapon ' to get her own way			2
mr @entity10 then claims @entity17 , who had fears about becoming pregnant , promised she would leave her lover if he had a vasectomy			1
in desperation , he agreed to the procedure , but it was not long before @entity17 left him for good and returned to yacht salesman @entity101			1

' within weeks of leaving him , mr @entity10 discovered she was being investigated for benefit fraud			0
and worse was to come - when he tried to recoup some of the money from his house and shop , he was told he had no rights because both were in @entity17 's name			2
