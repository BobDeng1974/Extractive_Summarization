by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 faced fresh accusations of double standards today amid claims @entity6 have been hired to hand out flyers in its anti-immigration election campaign			1
latvians have been hired by a firm in @entity12 to hand out flyers ahead of elections on may 22			1
it follows revelations the party used an @entity18 actor in a poster about @entity20 missing out on jobs , as @entity22 today stepped up his attack on @entity2 , accusing his rivals of not believing the country has a bright future			1
@entity2 leader @entity27 has used a £ 1.5million poster campaign to take on the bigger parties ahead of local council and @entity32 elections on may 22 @entity2 faced embarrassment after it emerged the builder in its latest anti-immigration advert was an actor , @entity36 , who is from @entity18 @entity2 has launched a £ 1.5million publicity drive in the hope of triggering a ' political earthquake ' by topping the @entity32 poll on may 22			2
but the campaign attacking ' open doors ' immigration from the @entity45 has been dogged by allegations of spin , fakery and hypocrisy			0
today it emerged that @entity2 flyers were being delivered by @entity6 hired by company @entity52 in @entity12			1
boss @entity53 told the @entity55 many of his employees are from @entity58 and ' only yesterday ' had been working for @entity2			1
@entity60 mp @entity59 said : ' @entity2 ’s hypocrisy knows no bounds			1
they say they are against @entity65 taking our jobs and then , when they have a chance to offer some @entity70 people work delivering their leaflets because they ca n’t find volunteers to do it , they employ @entity65 workers			2
' the row comes after it emerged that one of the stars of a @entity2 poster campaign , who appeared to be a @entity70 builder ‘ hit hard by unlimited cheap labour ’ , was actually an @entity18 actor , @entity82			2
today @entity2 launched an investigation into a tweet from a party account boasting about its ' indigenous , white candidate ' in the @entity87 by - election , @entity89 , who today gave an interview stressing he was now more relaxed about gay people			1
@entity22 took another swipe at @entity2 during prime minister 's questions in the @entity96 today @entity2 has urged to 18 per cent in the latest @entity98 poll for the @entity99 , with the @entity101 just one point behind @entity102			2
the conservatives have been torn between attacking @entity2 and trying to woo its supporters			2
but today in the @entity96 , mr @entity22 accused @entity2 of having a negative outlook about the future			1
speaking during prime minister 's questions , he said : ' @entity70 has benefited from being an economy that is open to investment and open to people coming who want to contribute and work hard here			0
' so much of their view seems to be that we do n't have a bright future in this country			0
' i absolutely believe that we do , if we get our deficit down , we get our economy growing , we invest in apprenticeships , we show that we can be one of the success stories of the @entity123			0
we 're making progress and that is the way to challenge their world view			0
' @entity2 has made gains in the polls after stepping up its attacks on immigration and the @entity45			2
yesterday the party confirmed its controversial @entity133 @entity89 will fight the upcoming @entity87 by - election for the party - despite recent controversy over a series of remarks about homosexuality			1
the party 's local @entity140 account - @entity2 @entity87 - tweeted soon after : @entity87 : our indiginous white candidate is ready to rock and roll # @entity143			1
' party aides inititally suggested the account was not official , but later it posted another message stating : ' several members have access to this account			0
' soon after @entity89 was named as @entity2 's candidate in the @entity87 by - electon , the @entity140 account @entity151 posted this controversial comment amid confusion about whether the account was official , this message appeared hours later mr @entity89 sparked outrage in 2012 after likening gay marriage to incest			1
the 70 - year - old has also claimed people should be able to prefer being straight to being gay - like some people prefer @entity164 to ordinary tea			2
and in 2000 he said being gay is ‘ not worthy of valid equal respect ’			1
but in an interview with the @entity169 today he said he had relaxed his views , but appeared to suggest gay people are more likely to have threesomes			2
mr @entity89 said : ' i was raised in a very traditional home and i guess i grew up with those attitudes , but hell , we are now in the 21st century and my position is exactly the same as the party 's position : that we are a broadly libertarian party and what two consenting adults , or indeed more than two consenting adults , choose to do together is none of my business , none of the party 's business and as far as we 're concerned , they 're free to get on with it			1
' @entity89 has rarely avoided controversy during his career as an mep , but has been returned to @entity193 three times mr @entity89 's selection comes after @entity2 leader @entity27 ducked the chance to fight the @entity198 seat			1
the byelection was called after the disgraced former @entity60 mp @entity200 resigned in the wake of a cash - for - questions scandal			2
mr @entity89 was elected to the @entity203 in 1999 as the @entity133 for the @entity204 - and re-elected in 2004 and 2009 - before defecting to @entity2 in march 2012			1
his outspoken views have caused controversy throughout his career and last year even mr @entity27 said he had gone ' too far ' with his attack on gay marriage			2
in 2012 mr @entity89 said : ' if two men have a right to marry , how can we deny the same right to two siblings ? are we to authorise incest ? ' his made the bombshell remarks in a pamphlet entitled ' straight talking on @entity65 '			1
@entity27 decided not to fight the @entity87 by - election - leaving himself open to accusations that he ' bottled ' his big chance the year before he asked : ' why is it ok for a surgeon to perform a sex - change operation , but not ok for a psychiatrist to try to " turn " a consenting homosexual ? ' mr @entity89 has also dismissed homophobia as a ' weasel word '			1
he said : ' the homosexual lobby is not content with decriminalisation			0
it wants to be accepted as a " valid alternative lifestyle "			0
' but it is not a valid lifestyle worthy of equal respect			1
' at the risk of offending the politically correct , i will argue that homosexual behaviour is abnormal and undesirable			0
' he previously questioned the existence of ' homophobia ' , saying some people found gay relationships ' distasteful if not viscerally repugnant '			2
he defended the remarks , saying : ' different people have different tastes			2
you may tell me you do n't like @entity247			0
that may be a minority view but you are entitled not to like it if you do n't like it			0
the @entity2 candidate added : ' i simply made the point that people were entitled to their personal preferences			2
' it is morally acceptable to prefer heterosexuality over homosexuality , or vice versa			0
most of us prefer one or the other			0
' he later added : ' i said that people may prefer heterosexuality or homosexuality			0
i did not say that people could dislike – much less hate – other people on the grounds of their sexual orientation			0
' the mainstream media are engaged in a feeding frenzy against @entity2 , and are prepared to twist the facts to suit their agenda			0
' mr @entity89 also insists that he has condemned homophobia during his career			1
he said ' prejudice , hostility and violence against homosexuals are wrong and totally unacceptable '			0
but mr @entity89 's controversial views are not restricted to homosexuality			1
he has claimed that women who are date raped must ‘ share part of the responsibility ’			0
mr @entity89 said in ' stranger rape ' the blame was ' squarely on the perpetrator ' but in date rape cases ' the victim surely shares a part of the responsibility , if only for establishing reasonable expectations in her boyfriend ’s mind '			1
the outspoken @entity133 has also claimed the @entity297 was ‘ systematically paedophilic ’			0
he said : ‘ so far as i know it has no rules or systems designed to support or promote paedophilia			0
' but i think it would be perfectly fair to describe it as systemically paedophile			0
’ despite mr @entity89 's controversial past , he was ' overwhelmingly ' endorsed by the @entity87 constituency association at a hustings meeting on monday before being backed by @entity2 's @entity310 , a party spokesman said			1
mr @entity89 said : ' i am both proud and humbled to have been selected by the constituency association in @entity87 to represent the @entity2 cause in this historic town in what could well prove to be an historic by - election			1
' ' it would be a huge honour to be elected to serve as @entity87 ’s mp and i will be giving my all over the next few weeks to achieve that outcome			0
' mr @entity27 said : ' he is a massively experienced and respected figure on the national political stage and on the local political stage as well			0
' i know that the @entity2 membership will rally to the cause of making @entity317 our first directly elected mp			0
' the @entity87 by - election is scheduled to take place on june 5 , with the @entity60 selecting @entity327 to run and @entity102 represented by @entity328			1
the @entity329 are expected to choose a candidate in the coming days .			0
