some say graphene is set to be the next super-material , while others claim the humble bamboo could be used in textiles and construction			0
but perhaps a sweeter option would be to open store cupboards and break out the chocolate , as this @entity11 user from @entity12 has done			1
the user , known as @entity14 , and his girlfriend created an entire quadcopter out of chocolate - and it not only flies , but it ’s edible as well			1
forget @entity19 's drones that can deliver your food - now you can cut out the middle man and have a drone made of food instead			0
@entity14 and his girlfriend claim this is the world 's first quadcopter made of chocolate that not only flies but can be eaten after it has landed on his @entity32 blog @entity14 revealed how his love of quadcopters and his girlfriend ’s love of baking combined to give rise to the invention			1
- 1kg ( 2.2lbs ) of dark chocolate - 100g ( 3.5 ounces ) of white chocolate - 1 x @entity43 ( autopilot system ) - 4 x @entity44 ( motor ) - 4 x @entity46 ( speed controller ) ‘ i was sceptical at first , ’ he wrote			2
‘ chocolate is not as stable as aluminium or carbon - which are typically used for copter frames			2
’ but the duo persevered , and the end result is something that , amazingly , is able to take flight without falling apart			0
as @entity14 explains , they began by making a silicon mould in the shape of a quadcopter , which is essentially a cross			2
the motors , flight controller and battery were attached to spacers , in order to separate them from the chocolate and prevent them heating and melting it			0
the chocolate was then poured into the mould , which was placed in the fridge until it set			1
the copter was taken outside and , much to the amazement of @entity14 and his girlfriend , flew without issue			2
and they were even able to have a bite to eat when it landed			0
‘ when you get hungry during the flight sessions you always have something to nibble with you , ’ @entity14 added			0
whether chocolate takes off as the material of choice for future inventions , though , remains to be seen			0
@entity14 and his girlfriend poured 1kg grams ( 2.2lbs ) of melted dark chocolate and 100g ( 3.5 ounces ) of white chocolate into a mould to make the chocolate quadcopter			1
after they had completed the flight @entity14 's girlfriend took a bite of the contraption , proving it was fine to eat			1

the world 's first chocolate quadcopter has been built and flown
a @entity11 user and his girlfriend from @entity12 are behind the invention
they poured *1.1kg* ( *2.4lbs* ) of chocolate into a copter - shape mould
they then let it set in the fridge before attaching the *blades* and the motor
and the contraption not only flew , but they were able to eat it afterwards
