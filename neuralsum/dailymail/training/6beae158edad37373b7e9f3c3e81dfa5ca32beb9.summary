@entity9 having his head shaved ( pictured ) - he has now been forced into isolation at his school for the short cut ' the next day he ended up in isolation and was told that he would have to stay there until his hair grew back to at least a number two			1
' i 've tried speaking to the headteacher but he says if he lets one student off with it the other 1,400 might follow			0
' on tuesday @entity9 was saying that he almost regretted do it , which is such a shame			2
luckily now he 's had so much support he 's enjoying it and he realises that what he has done for charity is a great thing			2
' he 's a model pupil , he 's on track to do really well , it 's not as if he 's a troublemaker or a little rebel trying to stick two fingers up at the school			2
' @entity9 hoped to raise just £ 100 from the head shave but has now raised more than £ 1,200 as news of the school 's reaction has spread			1
@entity9 said he is ' upset and disappointed ' that he is being punished for trying to do a good deed friends have rallied around and set up a @entity84 page calling for his release , a petition and have even started posting # freestan on posters around the school			1

' on monday teachers were supportive and one even donated			0
but in my last lesson my @entity98 teachers were concerned and took photos to send to the head of house			0
' the next day my tutor was told that i had to go to isolation			2
i tried to explain that it was for charity			0
' i am very upset and disappointed as i am being punished for doing charity fund raising			0
' i have had my break and lunch time taken away to be sat behind a computer screen in a small box like room			0
' i am starting to regret shaving my head because the days feel like weeks , it feels like a prison			0
' the uniform policy at the school - rated ' outstanding ' by @entity118 : ' very short hair or hair with designs cut in will be considered ' extreme '			2
' children who have extreme hairstyles will be isolated			0
' @entity9 says some teachers from @entity22 ( pictured ) even donated money to his charity page on @entity48 before he was told his hairstyle was against uniform rules and barred from the classroom @entity131 dr @entity130 said : ‘ i do not favour speaking publicly about individual students or their families and will not do so now			1
' @entity22 and @entity134 have held a firm line against those who decide to flout our behaviour policies for many years - it is only by doing this can we uphold our standards and make sure we are fair to all			0
' this incident is n’t the first and wo n’t be the last of this nature			0
' in the past parents have approached us about stunts to raise money for charity and we have been able to advise and work with them to avoid any difficulty			1
' at times , some parents do not do this and do not advise their children of potential problems			0
' isolation is one of the consequences for students that break our behaviour policies			0
' my stance is to review when someone is able to take their place again in the mainstream of our learning community – this i will do in these circumstances and this will be based on discussions with the student			0
' speaking generally , there are many ways to raise money for charity - most we will support ; rushing into a particular way without thought is always likely to cause consequences			1
' some people wish to avoid consequences by blaming others - i think this sends a poor message to young people			0
' i have consistently held this stance and parents , generally , know we set high standards			0
that 's why we expect them to have a dialogue with us before they allow their child to do something they may regret			0
' @entity9 's fundraising increased ten-fold within an hour of his story becoming public today and by 3pm his fundraising has soared to almost 40 times his original target , reaching £ 3,823.19 , with donations still flooding in			1

he was also swamped by messages from well - wishers who supported his decision to shave his head and criticised the school for putting him in isolation			1
one wrote : ' just read about your exclusion from school and wanted to say that you 're a very inspirational young man and stay strong in your beliefs as you go through life @entity9			1
take care x ' another added : ' well done young sir @entity9 - very courageous and admirable with a big heart			2
' your school teacher can learn to grow up following your example			0
do not be bullied into not following your heart by anyone			0
