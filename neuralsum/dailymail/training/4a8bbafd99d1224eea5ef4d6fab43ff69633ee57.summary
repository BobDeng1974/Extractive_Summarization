by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 14:27 est , 11 december 2013 updated : 16:22 est , 11 december 2013 a group of lawmakers has taken time out from @entity6 's budget showdown to propose an amendment to the @entity9 law that would exempt volunteer firefighters and paramedics from a loophole that threatens to close stations			1
the @entity9 was enacted without an exemption for volunteer first - responders , potentially forcing fire departments to buy coverage for hundreds of thousands of volunteers even though they 're not on any payroll			1
the result could have put most of @entity1 's 1 million fire departments in a position of diverting equipment and training funds to pay for insurance policies or federal government fines			1
thousands of them could face closure because of the added costs			0
@entity31 @entity30 rep. @entity30 wrote to @entity33 acting commissioner @entity32 last week , calling the result ' a public safety disaster			2
' @entity36 highlighted the issue on monday , bringing swift action from a @entity40 congressman and a bipartisan group of six @entity1 senators			0
his state leads the nation in the percentage of fire departments that are staffed by volunteers their ' protect volunteer firefighters and @entity69 ' would amend the @entity9 to provide volunteer emergency service workers a carve - out ensuring that they 're not counted toward employee totals that would trigger the law 's employer mandate			1
eighty - seven per cent of @entity1 fire departments are entirely or ' mostly ' staffed by volunteers , according to the @entity76			1
'' ’m sure that this is an unintended consequence of the @entity9 , but it is a very real threat to public safety. , ' @entity40 @entity58 rep. @entity57 told @entity36			0
@entity57 has spearheaded the effort , which attracted the attention of senators from both sides of the political aisle			0
' if fire companies have to provide health insurance to their volunteers , it would be an unbearable cost and many would have to reduce the number of volunteers , or close their doors entirely , ' he said			1
' either way , this is a serious public safety problem			0
of course , the @entity33 could solve it tomorrow by saying that volunteer fire fighters are not employees			2
' the @entity101 administration has offered a host of @entity9 exemptions to politically favored companies and labor unions			1
but sen. @entity106 , a @entity108 @entity107 , insisted that leaving volunteer firefighters on the sidelines was an ' unintentional consequence ' and ' a technical error			2
' firefighters battled a blaze in the aftermath of a nov. 18 tornado in @entity117 , @entity118			0
the vast majority of @entity1 firefighters are community volunteers wildfires like this august 2013 disaster near @entity124 , @entity125 bring volunteer firefighters out of the woodwork to risk their lives as written , @entity106 conceded , the @entity9 ' jeopardizes funding for training and emergency response hours by imposing unreasonable burdens on many of our volunteer emergency response agencies			1
' @entity136 , an independent senator from @entity137 , said in a statement that the bill ' will draw an important distinction between those volunteers and full - time , paid staff that will ensure emergency response units can continue to deliver robust services without the fear of having to deal with cumbersome federal regulations			0
' sen. @entity149 , a @entity150 , called it ' unacceptable that an undue burden could be placed on volunteer fire departments across the country			2
only @entity61 can prevent forest fires ? volunteers are often the first line of defense against wildfires in @entity1 's forests , and @entity9 threatened to put many of their fire departments in jeopardy of closing ' it is imperative that this ambiguity in the law be clarified and fixed , ' she said wednesday			1
@entity171 @entity170 sen. @entity169 added that ' first responders and firefighters who put their safety on the line to keep our families and communities safe ... need the certainty that they have the necessary resources to keep offering their services			0
' it 's unclear how many fire departments would have been negatively affected by the @entity9 in its current form , since the employer coverage mandate applies only to agencies that employe at least 50 people			1
annual fines for fire departments that choose to flout the law would amount to $ 2,000 per employee , beginning after the first 30			2
this @entity192 , the @entity193 and the @entity194 all offered endorsements of the legislation on wednesday			0
' this is a bipartisan issue which could have serious impacts on staffing at fire departments across the @entity1 , ' said @entity192 president @entity200			2
' the @entity192 looks forward to working with @entity61 and the @entity201 to help ensure fire departments of all types are able to continue saving lives and serving their communities			1
' @entity108 democrat @entity206 and @entity40 @entity58 @entity207 are also co-sponsors of the @entity210 legislation			0
' i would rather tear down the whole thing and start over again with a fresh health care approach , but the president has made it clear that he wo n't allow that to happen			0
so , we 're left to try to pave over the potholes , and this is a big one – possibly affecting fire stations nationwide			0
' @entity40 has the highest percentage of fire departments that are entirely or mostly volunteer - based , with 97 per cent			1

the @entity9 forces companies with more than 50 workers to buy them all health insurance or pay hefty fines
the @entity33 says volunteer firefighters are ' employees , ' even though the @entity231 says they 're ' volunteers '
out of more than 1 million fire departments in the @entity1 , *87* per cent are staffed entirely or mostly by life - saving volunteers
*members* of @entity61 now want the @entity101 administration to accept a *special* carve - out for volunteer first - responders
