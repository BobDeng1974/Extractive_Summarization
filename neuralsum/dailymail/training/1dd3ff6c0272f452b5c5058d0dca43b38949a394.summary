by @entity0 follow @ @ kie1410 @entity1 is eager for a fresh start in the @entity3 this season after @entity6 's record - breaking signing took to @entity7 to tell of their pre-season training			1
the winger , compared to the departed @entity10 at times last year , was bought from @entity11 for £ 30million , but struggled to adapt to the @entity13 game and was sidelined by on - off injuries			1
the 22 - year - old , however , seems keen to put that behind him , with new manager @entity17 at the helm after arriving from @entity19			2
the @entity51 star , though , made just 17 appearances last season in all competitions , scoring once in the @entity55 against @entity56			0
pre-season will be more pivotal for @entity6 than other clubs , given the arrival of @entity17 from @entity60 's			2
the @entity35 , notorious for leading heavy training sessions during pre-season , was given the chance to have a look see at what he will be working with in north @entity67			0
@entity17 , who led @entity19 to eighth place in the @entity3 last season , will be expected to qualify for the @entity70 and is the club 's third manager in the last two years			0
that is after they got rid of @entity75 and @entity76 , respectively			0
getting to know you : it was the first chance for the new manager to evaluate his players at @entity6 fitness : the @entity6 players not in @entity83 prepare for a season playing @entity17 's high pressing game depleted : the squad is still missing the likes of @entity88 and @entity89 who are at the @entity91			1

@entity1 *tweets* : ' another training session finished . great work . come on your @entity6 ! '
@entity17 begins work with @entity6 ahead of new season
@entity1 arrived from @entity11 for £ 30million in 2013 but struggled in first year
