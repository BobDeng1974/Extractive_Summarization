' after doctors explained their baby had a neural tube defect affecting the back of her head , they made the difficult decision to have a termination			1
' it was horrible , ' said mrs @entity7			2
' i had never even heard of the condition before , so it was a huge shock			0
the doctors told me it can be caused by a lack of folic acid and has a 1 per cent chance of occurring			2
' after the termination , she and her mr @entity61 , 24 , a tattooist , had a series of medical tests			0
