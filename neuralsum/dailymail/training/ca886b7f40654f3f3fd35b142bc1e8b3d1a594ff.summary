by @entity0 farmers have a wealth of technology and data at their fingertips to get the best from livestock , but one old - fashioned technique still remains			1
researchers in @entity10 have fitted 14 cows with cannulas in their sides , that are cut directly into the animal ’s digestive tract			1
the 8 - inch ( 20cm ) holes allow farmers to directly see how food is being processed , and are plugged using rubber stoppers when not being used			1
the 8 - inch ( 20cm ) holes allow farmers to see how food is being processed , and to analyse the animal 's energy efficiency the cannula acts like a porthole and gives direct access to the cow ’s rumen			1
once the cannula is surgically placed in the cow , the animals grazes for a set period of time before being examined			2
farmers remove the plug and pull the grass and oat mixture from the rumen			2
this material is collected and tested and this analysis shows farmers and researches which forages get the best results from the livestock , based on how much is digested			2
the practice is said to have become common place in the 1920s but reports of cows being used in this way for scientific research date back to 1833			0
cows with cannulas fitted are also known as fistulated cows			1
@entity64 , in @entity63 , @entity10 uses the cannulated cows to test the digestion of different , experimental blends of oats to create a more balanced feed for the animals			2

researchers in @entity10 fitted 14 cows with cannulas in their side
cannulas are holes that are cut directly into a cow ’s digestive tract
the 8 - inch ( 20cm ) holes allow farmers to see how food is being processed
*monitoring* the energy efficiency of cows can help improve farming methods and the environment
but animal rights campaigners have *criticised* the activity , branding it cruel
