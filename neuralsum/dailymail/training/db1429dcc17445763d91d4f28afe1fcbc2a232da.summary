when @entity12 anchor @entity11 asked @entity13 , the @entity14 's first cousin and close friend , if she was excited about the baby , her answer took the journalist by surprise			1
' not terribly , ' admitted the 88 - year - old , hooting with laughter			2
mrs @entity13 , who grew up with the @entity14 and was present at the @entity34 's deathbed in 2002 , sighed : ' well you know , everybody has babies			1

' the @entity7 tv host asked mrs @entity13 , the youngest daughter of the 16th @entity46 and his wife @entity47 , sister of the @entity34 , what sort of life the baby , which will be third in line to the throne , would have			1
mrs @entity13 said she hoped it would have ' just a jolly , happy , ordinary child 's life ' , something she said the @entity57 managed with the then princess @entity58 and @entity59			1
she added : ' the king and queen in those days made an enormous effort to give -- to keep their childhood sort of sacrosanct			0

' and i think that they have succeeded awfully well			0
' watch the @entity12 interview in full here mrs @entity13 , who lived at @entity69 and @entity70 during @entity71 , while she worked for @entity72 , went on to staunchly defend the @entity14 over criticism about the way she reacted to princess @entity76 's death in 1997 , staying up in @entity77 rather than returning to the capital			1
she said : ' i think it was an eminently sensible decision personally because what was the point -- we 've got two grieving children with you , @entity84 and @entity85 , whose mother 's just died unexpectedly			2
' and to go to @entity88 and sit in @entity70 with nothing to do , nothing to do except sit and think about your mother or look out of the window at the crowds , i mean , what help was that for the boys ? ' asked by the interviewer whether she talked to the monarch about the aftermath , mother - of - four mrs @entity13 said : ' no. no. and i 've never talked to her about it			1
i mean there are some things that one sort of keeps off , really			0

' mrs @entity13 was a bridesmaid at their wedding in 1947 , three years before her own wedding			1
mrs @entity13 admits that when she heard her aunt and uncle were to become the @entity14 and @entity131 of @entity132 , her reaction could have been more sophisticated			1
she said : ' i can remember to this day that i shamingly hopped around the dance floor , saying , " my uncle 's now king , " which was a very shaming thing to do , but i did it			2
' @entity107 with her future husband @entity108 - they went on to have four children after the death of her husband , @entity108 , mrs @entity13 became a woman of the @entity144 to her aunt , queen elizabeth the queen mother , a position she held until the latter 's death			1

she said : ' i cried in the film , it was so well done			0

so whether that was true or not , i do n't know			0

' she added : ' i think she 's got a way with her that 's going to be very appealing			2
and i think that she wo n't sort of vie for coverage with ... which @entity76 perhaps did a little bit			2
' after a fortnight spent waiting in the press pen outside @entity199 in @entity173 , journalists are running out of ways to kill the time			0
