by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 3 october 2012 updated : 01:56 est , 4 october 2012 the boss of defence giant @entity2 stands to make £ 18million almost overnight if the firm ’s controversial merger goes through			1
chief executive @entity5 is sitting on millions of lucrative share options which would usually take years to mature			2
but in what critics branded a ‘ scandalous ’ twist , they would pay him the giant windfall straight away if the £ 30billion deal to combine forces with the @entity16 and @entity17 - controlled aerospace conglomerate @entity15 is approved			1
profit : ceo @entity5 stands to make millions from the possible merger with @entity19 company @entity15 details of mr @entity5 ’s potential payday are now likely to be probed by the @entity22 , which is holding an inquiry into the proposed merger			1
it strengthens the claims of critics that a charmed circle of ministers , company bosses , senior mandarins and former civil servants is engaged in a stitch - up to push through the deal behind closed doors			0
former @entity37 boss sir @entity36 is lobbying the government on behalf of @entity39 , the investment bank which is expected to share in a multi-million pound payout for advising @entity2 on the deal			2
officials have also been forced to deny that cabinet secretary sir @entity43 , who used to work for @entity39 and has helped persuade @entity44 to support the deal , has any conflict of interest			0
money merger : the possible merger of @entity2 and @entity19 aerospace conglomerate @entity15 is a £ 30 million deal from which mr @entity5 is set to make £ 17.8 million contractors : @entity2 is one of the world 's largest deference contractors making fighter jets , defence systems and aircraft carriers , such as these two queen elizabeth - class aircraft carriers in addition , @entity60 leader @entity60 is also said to be supportive of the takeover which has come under fierce criticism from senior backbenchers including @entity66 grandee @entity65			1
@entity66 mps oppose the deal because they believe handing defence secrets to a company partly controlled by the governments of @entity16 and @entity17 will undermine national security , destroy the intelligence - sharing relationship with the @entity74 and cost @entity76 jobs			2
opponents point to recent reports from @entity79 and @entity80 as proof that both @entity16 and @entity17 are keen to retain a substantial stake of anything up to 27 per cent between them in the proposed merged defence giant			1
both companies are working towards an october 10 deadline for the submission of formal proposals for the deal			0
after 36 years in the company , mr @entity5 has built up extensive holdings of shares and options through a web of executive reward schemes			1
he has more than one million @entity2 shares in his portfolio , worth more than £ 3.36million at the current price			1
in a merger , he would either receive at least that amount in cash or the equivalent value in new shares in the combined group			2
mr @entity5 has also amassed options on around 4.5million shares in executive reward schemes set to bear fruit over a number of years			1
but a deal with @entity15 could trigger a ‘ change of control ’ clause set out in the company ’s annual report , meaning that they all pay out at once when the merger goes through			1
this would hand him an instant jackpot of £ 14.5millon , taking his grand total to £ 17.8million			0
it is not clear at this stage whether any or all of these sums will be paid out			0
critics last night called on mr @entity5 to waive the potential payouts			2
@entity128 , of the @entity130 union , which represents the engineering and shipbuilding industry in @entity133 , said it was ‘ scandalous ’ that the chief executive could receive the rewards			0
he said : ‘ from a moral position he must certainly give them up			0
i ’m surprised the political parties do n’t come forward to stop these rewards			0
’ he added : ‘ this is a deal where people risk losing their jobs and their skills , and we can ill afford to go down this route			0
‘ we do n’t want to be just a @entity16 player in two years ’ time			0
this will be a backward step			0
’ mr @entity128 also warned that the deal was like a ‘ runaway train ’ and was out of the government ’s control			0
mr @entity5 ’s future has not officially been decided because the two companies are still working on details of the merger and have not yet made a formal announcement on their top management team			2
but well - placed sources say the boss of @entity15 , former @entity17 paratrooper @entity162 , is virtually certain to be shoe - horned in as chief executive , leaving mr @entity5 to play second fiddle			1
mr @entity5 , who has been chief executive of @entity2 since 2008 , is said to be likely to stay on as head of a @entity76 - based defence division			1
in that case he may decide not to cash in on his lavish pile of shares and options			2
nevertheless , he is still likely to be a big winner big benefit : during his 36 years mr @entity5 has amassed options in an estimated 4.5 million shares in @entity2 which means that he stands to make an instant profit of £ 14.5 million from the merger in similar situations , other bosses involved in mega-mergers have tried instead to negotiate ‘ retention deals ’ granting them lucrative options to stay on			1
mr @entity5 last year took home a basic salary and bonus of £ 2.4million , and benefited from maturing share options worth almost £ 700,000 awarded in earlier years			1
he is also on course for a feather - bedded retirement , regardless of whether he remains in post until the company ’s normal pension age of 62 or steps down earlier			0
he has accumulated a pension pot worth more than £ 11.6million , which will pay him an income of just under £ 680,000 a year for the rest of his life			0
as part of a rolling programme of rewards , he was handed share options currently worth around £ 2.3million in 2011 , which are included in those that might pay out in the @entity15 takeover			1
his long - term incentives for this year have been boosted to 300 per cent of his salary , after a pay review deemed his package fell significantly short of his peer group in the @entity74			0
@entity2 refused to comment .			2

ceo @entity5 could make nearly £ 18million from his shares in the company if the merger goes through
@entity5 has more than one million @entity2 shares as well as options on an estimated 4.5 million shares
