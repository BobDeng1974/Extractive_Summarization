@entity0 will inflict much more damage on the conservatives than @entity3 in next year ’s general election , increasing the chances of @entity6 entering @entity7 , according to authoritative new research			1
its voters have overwhelming come from those who voted @entity12 in 2010 – and even the @entity13 have shed more to them than @entity3 , election experts say			1
most so - called ‘ core @entity3 ’ voters switching to @entity0 had already deserted the party between 2001 and 2010 as a reaction to @entity17 and @entity3 , they have found			1
@entity0 will inflict much more damage on the conservatives than @entity3 in next year ’s general election , increasing the chances of @entity6 entering @entity7 , according to authoritative new research by contrast , switches from the @entity12 to @entity21 ’s party are more recent and still happening – seriously undermining @entity24 ’s chances of winning a @entity26 majority in may			1
other findings of researchers at the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) suggest the @entity13 are on course for far greater losses next year than most have assumed			0
an analysis of the party ’s support suggests it could do worse than ‘ the already dire overall vote share in the polls and they are at risk of losing more than the half of their seats ’			0
meanwhile , a doubling of support for the @entity44 presages ‘ big @entity3 losses ’ north of the border and a ‘ potentially pivotal role for the @entity48 in a hung parliament ’			0
the rise of @entity0 , the @entity48 and the @entity51 has prompted increasing fears in @entity53 that @entity55 voters are set to return a hung parliament for the second election in succession – the first time there would have been such an outcome since 1910			2
the collapse of the @entity13 means that it is increasingly possible that only a three - party coalition will be able to muster enough seats to command a @entity26 majority			0
@entity67 , the frontrunner to succeed @entity68 , has hinted the country could be ruled by coalition of @entity3 , the @entity13 and the @entity48			0
@entity71 , the former @entity72 first minister , announced at the weekend that he is to run for a @entity74 seat for the @entity48 and is dropping ever stronger hints about his desire to play a key role in determining the next government			0
while @entity71 , ( pictured right ) the former @entity72 first minister , has ruled out any deal involving the @entity12 , he has suggested he might prop up a minority @entity3 government ( pictured left @entity6 ) he has ruled out any deal involving the @entity12 , but has suggested he might prop up a minority @entity3 government			2
despite a hung parliament being the most likely outcome and a fairer reflection of the fragmented distribution of votes , the two main parties are on course to win 90 per cent of @entity55 seats from a combined share of around two - thirds of the vote , according to the @entity29 research			0
professor @entity97 , from the @entity98 , a co-director of the @entity29 , said it was clear @entity24 had most to fear from the rise of @entity0			0
of @entity0 supporters in @entity3 seats , only 18 per cent voted @entity3 in 2010 , whereas 39 per cent were conservatives , ’ he said			1
other findings suggest the @entity13 are on course for far greater losses next year than most have assumed ‘ our data shows quite clearly that it ’s the @entity12 who need to worry most about the threat of @entity0 - because those people who supported @entity3 have in the main , already made the switch , ’ he said			2
‘ @entity3 ’s move to the liberal consensus on the @entity115 and immigration in 2001 , 2005 and 2010 , left many of their core voters out in the cold a long time before @entity0 were around			1
’ professor @entity97 said that because @entity0 were picking up long disaffected former @entity3 voters , it was clear they would not pose such a threat to labour seats			1
‘ in october , @entity3 narrowly held @entity124 and @entity125 in a strongly contested by - election , which showed high levels of @entity0 support in a traditionally @entity3 voting constituency			2
‘ but @entity29 data shows how @entity3 had lost these voters some time ago			2
most @entity0 voters who had voted @entity3 in 2005 had not voted for them in 2010			1
@entity0 support in @entity3 constituencies is more likely to be taken from disaffected former @entity3 voters , and these are far more likely to be manual workers than the middle classes that @entity3 appealed to			1
’ of @entity0 supporters in @entity3 seats , only 18 per cent voted @entity3 in 2010 , whereas 39 per cent were conservatives			1
professor @entity140 from the @entity141 , another co-director of the @entity29 , said separate research showed that contrary to the popular view , @entity0 is no more successful at winning over the politically disengaged than the other parties			0
only the @entity51 are set to gain more in 2015 from people who did n’t vote in either the 2005 and 2010 elections , ’ she said			0
previous non-voters make up 19 per cent of those intending to vote @entity149 – far higher than the other parties			0
as a percentage of all voters , those shifting to @entity3 and @entity12 from not voting is higher than @entity0 : 2.7 per cent for @entity3 , 2.2 per cent for conservative but only for 1.4 per cent for @entity0 .			2

new research suggests @entity0 will inflict more damage on the conservatives
would increase chances of @entity3 entering @entity160 following election
@entity0 voters are mainly those who voted @entity12 in 2010
