the @entity1 's new robotic camera system was introduced to cut costs , but exasperated news presenters continue to pay the price - to the amusement of viewers			1
problems arose after their introduction when the broadcaster moved to its new @entity11 headquarters in @entity12 as part of a £ 1billion revamp last year - and now it is feared the issue could get worse when a new computer system is launched			1
and viewers who caught the antics of the remotely - controlled robot cameras switching away from presenters reporting live or moving in the wrong direction have posted them online			1
last month , she calmly told viewers during an evening bulletin after the camera failed to focus on where she stood : ' i 'm just going to move back to the main set			2
i know this has happened before			2
' if i sidle in you can pretend you have n't noticed			0
' on a programme airing just a week later , the camera swung away from her again , leading her to declare : ' do you know i swear i 'm jinxed			2
what am i gon na do ? ' unsure of the camera 's intentions , she says ' i 'm going to stay where i am ' , she said as the camera zoomed back			0
' i 'll stay here			0
' having endured five such incidents , ms @entity25 said : ' if i sidle in you can pretend you have n't noticed ' she added : ' i 'm just going to move back to the main set			1
i know this has happened before ' the camera complications have become common enough that some choose to ignore them while others have attempted to fix problems themselves			0
in may last year , @entity1 business presenter @entity66 told viewers you have ' got ta love these robotic cameras ' before reach out in an attempt to switch the camera round			1
after being reprimanded , by producers , he said : ' they 're worried i 'm going to touch the cameras			2
i 'm not touching your precious robots ! ' and @entity75 was reporting live last year when the camera suddenly swung away and began focusing on random parts of the studio			0
a week later , it happened again , leading her to declare : ' do you know i swear i 'm jinxed			2
what am i gon na do ? ' she apologised , adding : ' clearly not meant to be doing that ' the robot cameras - which are ordinary broadcast cameras fixed to robotic heads and pedestals - are considered ideal for productions where the same smooth shot is needed to be repeated many times in the same programme and were supposed to eliminate the need to for operators			1
but glitches mean they sometimes malfunction			1
the @entity93 reported that there are concerns the glitches may become even more frequent when @entity26 replaces its computer system with a new one in the next two years			1
it is called the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) and this system communicates with a programme called @entity102 which controls the cameras			1
the current enps and its replacement are set to run together for a period			0
a source told the newspaper : ' they are due to run together for some time			0
' but bearing in mind the problems that happen with cameras already no one is quite sure what will happen when @entity102 has to work with the old and a new system			1
' a @entity1 spokesperson said : ' the @entity1 is undertaking a procurement for a @entity116 under the @entity117 ( 2006 ) , having advertised in the @entity118 of the @entity119 , reference @entity120 174 - 300782			0
' the @entity1 is not able to comment further on this procurement until the completion of that process			0
' this is because the @entity1 must not do anything that might adversely affect that ongoing process , and due to commercial confidentiality			0
