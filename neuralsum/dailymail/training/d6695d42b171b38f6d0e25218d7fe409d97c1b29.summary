a massive world 2,500 times the size of @entity2 has been discovered by an international team of astronomers			1
named @entity6 - 2011 - @entity5 - 322 , the planet is around eight times the size of @entity9 , the largest planet in our solar system			1
astronomers believe it orbits a star 25,000 light - years away and has a mass that is one third that of our sun. a massive world 2,500 times the size of @entity2 has been discovered by an international team of astronomers			1
pictured is an artist 's concept of an alien planet the giant planet , reported by @entity25 at @entity26 , was found using a technique known as ‘ microlensing ’			2
@entity29 uses @entity31 ’s theory of general relatively which suggests what we perceive as the force of gravity actually arises from the curvature of space and time			0
@entity31 believed that although @entity2 appears to be pulled towards the sun , it is in fact the shape of space - time around the sun that changes the way @entity2 moves			1

@entity29 makes use of this theory by measuring how the light of a distant star is intensified due to the gravitational field of a closer star			0
according to @entity31 ’s theory , this is caused by bending of the surrounding space - time which makes the more distant star easier to discover by @entity2 observatories			2

the transient brightening of @entity73 was seen in 2011 by astronomers in @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78			0
data from these observations suggest that giant world is likely to be an m - type - the most common type of star in space			0
the planet is thought to have an orbital distance times four - times the @entity2 ’s distance from the sun. the research suggests that if such a massive planet can exist at that distance from its star , then current formation theories about planets may be incorrect			1
a massive cluster of galaxies is pictured in this undated image courtesy of @entity99 and @entity100			0
the gravitational field surrounding this cluster , acts as a natural lens in space to brighten and magnify the light coming from very distant background galaxies			0

named @entity109 , the planet is eight times the size of @entity9
it has an orbital distance times four - times the @entity2 ’s distance from the sun
*scientists* believe it may *overturn* current theories on planet formation
