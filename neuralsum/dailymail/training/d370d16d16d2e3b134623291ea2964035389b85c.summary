@entity0 is clearly not a man to waste his time with the simple shots when on the basketball court - it 's spectacular or nothing			2
the first - year student at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity7 won himself a truck after making a miraculous half - way line shot on the buzzer during a half - time challenge at a @entity16 match			1
the odds were stacked against @entity0 when he was picked out the crowd at @entity9 's @entity20 event on tuesday night			0
@entity9 first year student @entity0 won himself a truck by completing a basketball challenge the student sank a miraculous shot from half - court with just one second left on the clock to win the prize @entity0 was mobbed by @entity9 players and fans after achieving the incredible feat he had to score with a lay - up , a free throw , a three - pointer and then the half - court shot - all within 30 seconds - to win the @entity34 worth £ 32,000			1
and it 's fair to say things did n't start too brilliantly for the mop - haired , cargo pant - wearing fresher as he missed the lay - up shot , the easiest of the lot , not once but twice			0
he finally did it and then nailed the free throw on the first attempt , giving himself plenty of time to sink the three - pointer			2
just as well because @entity0 , clearly not a baller , needed quite a few goes to make the shot count			0
things had not started too well for the student , who needed three attempts to make a simple lay - up shot the third part of the challenge was to score with a three - pointer and @entity0 needed quite a few goes everyone wanted to join @entity0 in his celebrations after completing the challenge then , against all the odds with just five seconds remaining , he somehow summoned all the good fortune in the world to score from half - way with a once - in - a - lifetime shot , sparking delirious scenes as the @entity9 team and fans ran over to mob him			1
as @entity0 proves , it 's sometimes better to have @entity68 on your side than actually be good at something .			0
