baked beans have been given a posh makeover by @entity2			2
the 18th - century department store known for its rather posh preserves is selling a brand which has added onions , apple - and even bacon to the humble baked bean			0
while the concoction certainly sounds palatable , the price might make you think twice			0
at £ 3.95 for a pot of @entity15 it 's a big ask to dig deep for what you 're used to spending no more than £ 1 on			1
but we conducted a taste test and found these beans are twice as good as @entity21 - and 10 times tastier than @entity22			1
the once - revolutionary product is nowadays considered the cheap and cheerful preserve of students and children			0
but the retailer is changing the face of dining once more by reinventing the humble toast - topper into an upmarket side			0
proper beans founder @entity40 , 33 , decided to turn the market on its head , bringing recipes back to their origins with gourmet versions of the humble staple			1
he had the idea for the brand from his father			0
‘ he told me that he makes his own baked beans and it struck me as strange that i 'd never thought of it as something you can cook from scratch , ' he says			0
' it 's crazy that tinned baked beans are a hugely successful universal product , and yet nothing has really changed with them in so many years			0
why have n't they improved like all the other food we eat ?			0
' far from being processed and tinned , his handmade beans are hand cooked with fresh ingredients including free - range meats and are found in the chilled section			2
proper beans are available in four varieties : such as smoked bacon & @entity76 mustard the tasty gourmet side contained onions , tomato and chunky , meaty bacon recipes range from the classic pork , haricot beans and tomatoes ( the origin of what we know as baked beans today ) to vegetarian recipes and some more experimental ingredients such as @entity92 - grown fava beans			1
proper beans are available in four varieties : such as smoked bacon & @entity76 mustard - a pork and haricot bean combination inspired by classic baked bean recipes			1
@entity100 & @entity101 , £ 3.95 , ' a gourmet side ' 2			1
@entity21 barbecue beans , 82p , ' comforting toast topper ' 3			2
@entity28 baked beans & pork sausages , 50p , ' processed hangover food ' 4			1
@entity22 organic baked beans , 62p , ' vinegary and watery ' they certainly were the tastiest - but we do n't recommend using them as toast topping after spending a year experimenting in his kitchen in @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity40 left behind his job in advertising and decided to spend his life savings on starting @entity15			1
@entity40 : ‘ the main focus for me was the taste			2
you ca n't reproduce a tin of baked beans at home ; the ingredients are far too processed			2
@entity15 are fresh , handmade and there 's nothing in them that you could n't buy at the supermarket			2
they taste so much better and they 're just so much better for you			0
' when i first told people that i resigned from my job and i was going into making baked beans some said " you 're completely crazy "			0
most people think that beans ca n't change - always the same colour , and consistency			0
but as soon as they tried them , they realise what baked beans can and should be ' proper beans are available in the chilled aisle at @entity146 and masons at £ 3.95			1
@entity22 organic , at 62p , taste ' vinegary ' - and are not worth the money , according to our taste test ( l ) as @entity21 barbecue beans , 82p , were comforting and definitely one to pop on toast in chilly winter ( r ) proper beans are currently available in four varieties , and more are coming out soon - £ 3.95 each			1

@entity100 & @entity40 launched four new types of ' @entity15 ' at £ 3.95 each
