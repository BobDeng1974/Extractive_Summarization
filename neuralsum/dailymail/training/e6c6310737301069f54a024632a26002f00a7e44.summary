published : 09:37 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 10:38 est , 29 may 2013 with hand washing rates astoundingly low in healthcare workers and costs related to hospital - acquired infections in the billions , some hospitals have turned to high - tech surveillance cameras and sensors to encourage better hygiene for their doctors and nurses			1
when healthcare workers at @entity13 , @entity15 's @entity14 enter an intensive care room , for instance , a motion sensor is triggered			2
a camera is then turned on and its video footage sent to a center in @entity20 where workers watch to ensure proper hand hygiene is taking place			2
which is just to say , to make sure doctors and nurses are washing their hands prior to interacting with patients			2
as simple a task as it may seem in an environment where professionals are trained to make split - second , life - saving decisions , studies have shown hand washing rates in hospitals to be dismal			1
shocking : studies show hospital workers need encouragement to wash their hands , with compliance rates as low as 30 percent in some hospitals the @entity42 says that studies show rates of hand washing in hospital workers prior to any type of patient interaction are as low as 30 percent without some form of encouragement			1
the reasons for non-compliance are many			0
@entity53 , who founded @entity54 , which provides sensor badges to hospital workers that track their hand washing , says an overburdened mind might be a chief reason			1
‘ nurses have to remember hundreds — thousands — of procedures , ’ he told the @entity42			0
‘ it ’s really easy to forget the basic tasks			0
you ’re really concentrating on what ’s difficult , not on what ’s simple			0
’ @entity53 ’s product knows when a healthcare worker has neglected to wash his or her hands			2
a badge vibrates when the worker approaches a patient ’s bed , gently reminding them to scrub up			0
dangerous : hospital - acquired disease kills up to 100,000 per year and federal regulations will soon punish hospitals where preventable transmissions occur studies have also found that doctors , more than nurses or any other workers , are most resistant to washing their hands			1
the reason , according to the studies , seems to be a resistance to authority			0
‘ there are still staff out there who say , ” how dare they , ” ’ said @entity92 school of nursing ’s @entity93			0
to root out non-compliance and avoid losing @entity103 funding under new federal rules that punish hospitals where preventable diseases are transmitted , hospitals have begun instituting an array of hand washing encouragement techniques in addition to the high - tech surveillance			1
encouragement : among other techniques , @entity114 in @entity115 has its workers wear pins like these and officials say they really encourage patients to ask about hand washing they are training hand washing coaches , hiring monitors who dress like hospital personnel and secretly watch for hand washing compliance , and giving out coupons for things like pizza and coffee to those who meet certain levels of compliance			1
subtle : ' you do not want to say , " you did not wash your hands , " ' says dr. @entity134 of @entity114 in @entity115 , where colleagues instead hand out red cards to non-complying workers , like a soccer match dr. @entity134 of @entity139 in @entity115 trains compliance coaches			1
one of the techniques he uses , he borrowed from the sport of soccer			0
when one worker notices another has not washed his or her hands , they can be given a red card by their colleagues			0
‘ it ’s a way to communicate , ’ said dr. @entity134 , ‘ in a nonconfrontational way that also builds teamwork			0
’ dr. @entity134 ’s hospital also has its workers wear pins that read things like ‘ ask me if i ’ve washed my hands , ’ ‘ @entity160 , ’ and ‘ hand hygiene first ’ and @entity134 said patients ’ families , especially parents of pediatrics patients , are n’t shy about asking doctors about their cleanliness			1
at @entity14 , a 2011 program saw the installation of digital scoreboards that record hand washing compliance rates for each shift			2
the intensive care unit saw a leap in hand washing rates			2
prior to the scoreboards , the numbers hovered around 6.5 percent compliance			0
with them , they reached into the 80 and 90 percent range			0
workers at places like @entity114 who continue to exhibit bad hand hygiene can be forced to take remediation classes			0
they must then , in turn , teach other non-compliant workers what they learned			0
but for all the mild admonishments or coercion techniques , the real reasons for increasing hand washing rates is to save lives			1
a recent @entity197 report says drug - resistant superbugs are on the rise and nearly 100,000 patients die each year from infections acquired in hospitals			1
effective : some doctors are now under surveillance by observers in @entity20 who note hand washing non-compliance			1
hospitals where workers know they 're being observed have seen skyrocketing hand washing rates			1

hospital workers wash their hands as little as 30 percent of the time they interact with patients , studies show
*efforts* in @entity15 hospitals and elsewhere seek to save *$* 30 billion lost per year to hospital - acquired infections by installing surveillance *equipment* at hand washing sinks
