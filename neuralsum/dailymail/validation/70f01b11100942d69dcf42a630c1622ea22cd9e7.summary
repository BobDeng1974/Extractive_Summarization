she was once the largest ocean liner in the world and her sinking caused shockwaves across the globe when 1,198 passengers and crew lost their lives after a @entity9 attack			1
now a newly discovered image suggests previous claims that the name of @entity13 was painted out to protect her on her fateful final voyage in 1915 were untrue , making her a legitimate target for @entity19 submarines			1
officials at the time had said everything had been done to try and protect the @entity24 boat - including painting out its name - meaning that enemy vessels would have struggled to work out if she was a civilian ship , or an armed merchant cruiser as the @entity13 was			1
this picture , which has only just emerged , is believed to be the last one ever taken of the @entity13 in @entity30 - and it clearly shows her name had not been painted over as authorities had said the @entity13 ( pictured ) was sunk by a @entity19 u-boat in 1915 killing 1,198 passengers and crew @entity36 , 35 , from @entity30 , said : ' it was said they had done everything to make her less ' findable ' to the enemy , camouflaging her for protection , helping protect her from attack			1
' it was stated that the ship 's name was obscured at the same time , in an attempt to conceal her identity			0
the photo in question helps to clear up a long standing myth			0
' the @entity13 was torpedoed by a @entity19 u-boat in 1915 , 11 miles off the southern coast of @entity55 and inside the declared ' zone of war '			1
a second internal explosion sent her down in just 18 minutes			0
much like the @entity60 , the @entity13 did no carry enough lifeboats for all the passengers , officers and crew , and was actually carrying four lifeboats fewer than the titanic carried in 1912			1
this was common practice for large passenger ships at the time , as it was believed that in busy shipping lanes help would never be far away			0
however , due to the lack of life boats nearly 1,200 people lost their lives , making it one of the greatest maritime tragedies of all time			0
one of the new pictures to emerge of passengers onboard the @entity13 before its sinking the ship was attacked off the coast of @entity55 after leaving @entity30 for @entity83 in may 1915 she was launched by the @entity85 in 1906 , alongside her sister ship , the @entity87			1
it was the incident that helped convince the @entity89 to enter the @entity90			0
the sinking caused a storm of protest in the @entity89 as 128 @entity89 were among the dead			0
president @entity94 said ' @entity89 is too proud to fight ' and demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships			0
the ship 's sinking provided @entity24 with a propaganda opportunity and turned public opinion in many countries against @entity19			1
this helped shift public opinion in the @entity89 against @entity19 and influenced @entity89 's eventual declaration of war two years later in 1917			1
the @entity13 became an iconic symbol in military recruiting campaigns of why the war was being fought			1
in january 1917 @entity19 resumed unrestricted submarine warfare			2
after submarines sank a further seven @entity89 merchant ships @entity94 finally went to @entity112 on april 6 , 1917 , calling for a declaration of war on @entity19 the @entity13 and the @entity87 were launched at a time of fierce competition for the @entity117 trade			1
the @entity19 shipping lines were aggressive competitors in the transatlantic trade , and the @entity13 and the @entity87 were built to outperform their @entity19 counterparts			1
they were fitted with then - revolutionary turbine engines , enabling them to maintain a service speed of 25 knots			0
they were also equipped with lifts , wireless telegraph , electric lights and provided 50 per cent more passenger space than any other ship			2
@entity13 was subsidised by the @entity24 government , in the hope that she could be converted into a military vessel if needed			2
a secret compartment was designed for the purpose of carrying arms and ammunition , and when war was declared the @entity13 was requisitioned by the @entity141			2
she began her new role as an armed merchant cruiser , and was put on the official list of @entity146			0
the @entity147 codified the rules for naval engagements involving civilian vessels			0
the @entity151 required that the crew and passengers of civilian ships be safeguarded in the event that the ship is to be confiscated or sunk			1
popular myth says that to protect the @entity13 , her name was painted over - so that she could not be identified as a military vessel			1
one of the new pictures to emerge of passengers onboard the @entity13 before its sinking a survivor of the sinking pictured after being brought back to shore - 1,198 passengers and crew died the @entity151 mean that she could have been searched , but thanks to her secret compartment her military cargo would have remained undetected			1
the ship was designed by @entity171 and built by @entity172 and @entity173 in @entity174 , @entity175			0
she was launched by the @entity85 in 1906			0
the ship was 787ft long and featured nine passenger decks			2
she was kitted out with 25 scotch boilers and four direct - acting @entity179 steam turbines producing 76,000 hp. the ship also boasted four triple blade propellers			0
@entity13 was fitted with revolutionary new turbine engines and was able to maintain a service speed of 25 knots			2
she was equipped with lifts , wireless telegraph and electric light			0
the ship provided 50 per cent more passenger space than any other boat			2
she held 552 passengers in first class , 460 in second , 1,186 in third class , alongside 850 crew members and 7,000 tons of coal			2
however , this new evidence shows that immediately before her final journey from @entity30 to @entity83 she was still showing her livery , and @entity13 is clearly visible			1
with a life - long interest in ocean liners , mr @entity36 has a vast knowledge of the subject and has spent a lifetime reading about ships such as the @entity60 and the @entity13			2
he decided to write a book about the @entity13 , to debunk all the myths that lie around its history , and to illustrate the book he collected photos from other fans of the subject			1
one of the photo contributors sent @entity214 an image that came from a collection he had purchased , clearly showing the name ' @entity13 ' printed on the side of the boat as it prepares to make its final journey			1
@entity214 said : ' my main focus is in trying to sort through a veritable minefield of idiotic conspiracy theories - such as deliberately setting up the ship to be sunk in order to bring the @entity89 into the war , the bizarre theories of high explosive cargo causing the second blast			0
' about 10 years ago i realized that the history of the @entity13 's early career , which was eminently successful over the course of about seven and a half years , had gone largely unexplored			2
' most authors simply wrote that the ship was big and fast , entered service in 1907 , and then the war started			0
' this was something that truly needed to be researched and told , and this book followed a lot of leg work in pinning down some of that history 's highlights			0
the @entity13 was subsidised by the government so she could be converted into a military vessel if needed ' @entity13 , in particular , has been the victim of a great deal of bad information and even conspiracy theories over the years			2
' as far as this particular image , it 's currently held in the collection of @entity13 historian @entity254			0
' @entity254 purchased the album some time back , and i think over the years the original information was sadly lost			0
' the photograph shows that the ship 's name was not painted out			1
they were n't trying to conceal her identity , as has been claimed			0
' @entity265 ' , book is published by @entity266 captain @entity267 was the torpedo officer on the @entity19 u-boat , the @entity270 , who saw to the preparation and firing of the torpedo that sank the @entity13 on may 7 1915 the @entity13 is pictured arriving in @entity30 around 1907 - it was once the world 's largest passenger ship			1

the @entity13 passenger ship was torpedoed by @entity19 in 1915
it was travelling from @entity30 to @entity83 on may 7 when tragedy struck
with even less lifeboats than the titanic 1,198 passengers and crew died
new book suggests name was not painted out as it should have been
the last photo taken of the ship shows the name was clearly visible
