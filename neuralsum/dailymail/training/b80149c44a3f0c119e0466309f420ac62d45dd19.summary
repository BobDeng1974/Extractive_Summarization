‘ at the moment we ’re just very happy to have it and it feels as though it ’s a lovely show for us			2
‘ we ’ll see what happens			0
i think it ’s a bit like a flag going up is n’t it ? if you have a programme that ends with 7million [ viewers ] it ’s not going to be unnoticed is it ? ‘ i think it ’s something that if you ’re running a channel like @entity8 you have to take into your stride			1
