by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 there would be no more symbolic sight than @entity4 walking down the pavilion steps at @entity6 ’s next month to make his test debut for @entity8			1
it would be a triumph for modern society as well as this hugely talented cricketer			2
@entity4 knows that if that day comes — and there is every chance @entity8 will pick him to be their all - rounder against @entity17 — he will initially gain as much attention for his physical appearance as his wristy batting and attacking off - spin			1
that is fine by him			2
for , with his luxuriant beard to the fore , he wants to be a role model not just for the @entity25 but any young cricketer treading the same path that he did growing up in multi-cultural @entity28			1
we have returned to the area in the east of @entity8 ’s second city where @entity4 emerged from a quite extra-ordinary @entity35 @entity34 family			1
we are here for a @entity38 coaching session and the kids are hanging on his every word			2
foot in the door : @entity4 hopes to make his test debut for @entity8 against @entity17 next month a tape - ball ( a tennis ball wrapped in tape to give it more weight ) is used in the playground of the @entity50 and @entity51 , just as it was in the back garden arena that his father and uncle , twins who married sisters , set up for him and his cricketing brothers and cousins			1
this is about showing that anyone from any background can enjoy cricket			2
‘ we all played in my family and cricket has always been in the blood , ’ said @entity4 before joining up with the @entity64 squad for their match against @entity17 at @entity66 on tuesday			1
‘ we did n’t really worry about education because we all thought we would end up playing cricket			2
i think my dad always believed i would play for @entity8 , probably more than i believed it , but it never crossed our minds that we were n’t going to make it			1
’ the aspiration was always to play for @entity8			1
@entity4 is as proud to come from @entity28 , as he is of following @entity79			1
‘ a lot of @entity81 i ’ve met have said , “ why do n’t you play for @entity83 ? ” , but for me it was always about playing for @entity8 , ’ he said			1
roots : @entity4 wants more young @entity35 asians to support @entity8 rather than @entity87 or @entity83 role model : the @entity8 all - rounder coaches young kids in his home city @entity28 ' my job as a muslim is to change all the negativity about @entity79 ' ‘ this is my country , this is where i was born			1
i was saying to ( @entity8 captain ) @entity99 the other day that as soon as i land or drive into @entity28 i feel at home			1
no matter where i ’ve been in the world			2
i like to see the kids in my area wearing @entity8 shirts , not @entity83 or @entity87 ones			1
a lot of it comes from the older generations but it ’s changing slowly , especially if people like myself and @entity111 are playing for @entity8			1
i would like to see that change a bit more			2
’ the beard that is an outward sign of his faith is as important to him as his background			2
‘ i wear the beard as a label , ’ he said			2
‘ religion is very important to me			2
one of my aims is to try to show that you can have faith and play cricket			2
there can be a lot of negativity and misunderstanding of @entity79			2
‘ i feel my job as a @entity94 is to change that and show people what my faith is really like			2
a lot of what is said and written is ridiculous but that ’s life			2
i just get on with it and try to be as positive as i can			2
’ on the scene : @entity4 made his international debut in the @entity139 in a one - day series against @entity141 in the swing : @entity4 in action for @entity144 those aims stretch to encouraging @entity35 asians to be more inclusive themselves			1
for @entity4 , who named his son born last year @entity149 in honour of the first man to accept @entity79 , believes that they can be as much at fault as traditional @entity155 clubs for sometimes not opening their doors to all races			1
‘ a kid came up to me and said , “ can you recommend a club where i wo n’t experience racism ? ”			0
i told him , “ every club ”			0
people use race and religion as an excuse			0
i can honestly say there are no barriers if you work hard			0
‘ i do n’t think there ’s any prejudice			0
my club , @entity172 , welcomed us with open arms and was a great place for a young player to go and learn			1
it can work both ways			0
a lot of @entity81 need to be a bit more open to going out there and giving it a crack rather than having some sort of problem joining a club			0
they can perhaps presume prejudice when it is n’t there			0
’ @entity4 insists he has never experienced racism during his career with @entity191 , @entity144 and now @entity8			1
‘ people outside cricket might be surprised just how accommodating every team i ’ve played in have been , ’ he said			0
‘ i was really surprised how nice and understanding everyone is			0
@entity144 have been unbelievable , which is one of the reasons why i signed long - term			1
when it ’s time to pray they let me and when i need to do stuff , i do it			0
‘ i ’ve never once experienced racism from any other player			0
you experience ignorance but that ’s not the same thing at all and i ’m always willing to discuss things			0
if that helps people learn that there ’s nothing to fear from @entity79 that ’s great			0
i can show these kids here today that you do n’t have to change to fit in			0
’ the predominantly @entity34 children taking part in the @entity38 session love every minute of their time with @entity4			1
values : @entity4 's beard is a sign that he is very religious and he wants to change views on @entity79 ‘ my aim is just to try to inspire them to play , even if it is just one kid out there — to try to get them to push themselves and to show them it ’s not impossible to do very well at the game			1
‘ even when you see someone on tv it ’s not quite the same as seeing them in the flesh at something like this			0
i can meet people and tell them that i came from exactly the same background and did exactly the same things as them at school			0
i remember @entity191 ’s @entity244 coming to my school and i thought , “ this is what i want to do			0
i want to play cricket ”			0
that ’s the message i want to get across			0
’ it is a message he can get across even more if he plays at @entity251 on june 12			1
if he does , then watch out for the new mystery spin delivery he has been working on with @entity253 , a master of the art , at @entity255			1
‘ @entity253 is teaching me a few tricks , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’ve been working with him and soon i will be ready to show my skills			1
i ’d like to be the first @entity8 player to bowl the doosra ( a delivery that spins in the opposite direction to the off - break , the off - spinner ’s default ball )			1
i ’m not far away			0
i just need to reach the point where i know exactly what ’s going to happen when i bowl it			0
it ’s coming out nicely			0
’ fine tuning : @entity8 trained at @entity66 on sunday ahead of their t20 international against @entity17 in a spin : @entity83 's @entity253 , pictured playing for @entity144 , has helped @entity4 with his bowling @entity4 , who , at nearly 27 , has learnt his craft in county cricket , believes there is as much suspicion in @entity8 about mystery spin as about @entity79			1
‘ everybody is bowling it now apart from us but every young off - spinner in this country should be taught how to bowl a doosra , ’ said @entity4			1
‘ it ’s happened in other countries for a long time now but we always seem to have a problem with it and somehow feel it ’s going to destroy our spinners			0
we never seem open to these kind of things but we will have to be and i think we are slowly realising that people ca n’t just bowl orthodox off - spin any more			1
‘ our batsmen always struggle against mystery — everybody does — and you have to have it these days or you ’re not going to last too long			0
‘ there are so many different actions out there with people who have kinks and i do n’t see why i ca n’t get away with it			0
i have asked a lot of people and 95 per cent who have watched me have said they think my action is legal when i bowl it			0
i ’m going to do it anyway and if the umpires call me for throwing they will call me			0
we should n’t be scared of it any more			0
’ he is an inspiring figure in more ways than one			0
@entity4 was coaching at a ‘ @entity38 supported by @entity318 ’ session			1
@entity318 supports programmes such as @entity38 as part of its 5 @entity322 commitment to provide the next generation with the skills they need to fulfil their potential .			0

@entity4 wants more young @entity35 asians to support @entity8
all - rounder in line to make test debut against @entity17 in june
@entity4 has been working on his bowling with @entity83 's @entity253
