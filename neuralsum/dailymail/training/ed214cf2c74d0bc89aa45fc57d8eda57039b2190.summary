ladies and gents , put down your technology and have more sex			2
that 's the advice from a team of scientists who found people are becoming so enveloped by their phone and tablets that their love lives are being put on the back burner			1
so if you are one of those reading this on your smartphone in bed , a glance across the sheets is likely to reveal your partner is engrossed in theirs too			0
the researchers discovered 70 per cent of women said smartphones were interfering in their romantic relationship			1
the study said technology and the screens that consume us are creating ' technoference ' in couples			1
a new study has found 70 per cent of women believe smartphones are interfering with their love lives , creating ' technoference ' between couples ( file picture ) that ranges from picking up the phone while partners are casually hanging out to checking @entity40 while in the middle of an argument			1
' you see it everywhere ' , said @entity45 , psychologist at @entity46 and an author of the study			0
' like at a restaurant where couples have their phones , both of them , on the table , right there			2
i think that is so easy for them to pick it up if it buzzes			0
' the study surveyed 143 married or cohabiting heterosexual women and asked them about their phone , tv , computer and tablet habits			1
it also asked about how their partner used technology , if there was any conflict about using technology , and about their satisfaction with their relationship and life overall			0
the participants said computers were the most interfering technology in their relationship , followed by mobiles			1
they also reported that of five scenarios presented to them , the most common interference was seeing a partner pick up his phone during ' couple leisure time ' , with 62 per cent of women reporting this happened at least once a day			1
experts have advised banishing smartphones and tablets from the bedroom to spice up your love life relationships expert @entity96 , writing on the @entity95 website , said 40 per cent of women said their men would get distracted by the tv during a conversation at least once a day , while a third said he would take out his phone in the middle of a conversation or during a meal together			1
a quarter said their partner would actually send texts or emails to another person while they were having a face - to - face conversation			0
but worse than the intrusions was the way they made the women feel ; they found , as you might expect , that conflict over technology was associated with poorer relationships , which in turn were associated with lower life satisfaction			1
@entity121 , developmental psychologist at @entity122 and @entity123 , @entity124 , said : ' with mobile phone technology emerging on the scene as quickly as it did , we all jumped into computer - mediated interactions without really thinking much about the implications			2
' however , this study involved a small group of women , and the researchers acknowledge that these correlations could be due to other factors affecting a person 's well - being			0
but for those feeling similarly aggravated by smartphone interrupts , the authors say the answer is n't to completely remove technology from the relationship			0
' it 's not silly for couples to make rules about technology , ' said dr @entity45			2
' just having the discussion about what 's ok and what 's not when it comes to devices at the dinner table or in the bedroom can help			0
' her own method : ' put [ the phone ] out of my reach , like on top of the refrigerator , just so that it releases the temptation			0
' the study was published in the journal @entity165 .			0
