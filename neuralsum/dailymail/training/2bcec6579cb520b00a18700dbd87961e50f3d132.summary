by @entity0 the @entity1 may be over for another year but that has n’t stopped an @entity3 building a street version of the superfast sled - powered by jets			1
@entity8 ’ luge is fitted with two thrusters that produce 200lbs ( 91kg ) of thrust each			1
fellows claims his design has the potential to reach 311mph ( 500km/h ) and he plans to take on the current world record of 115.83 mph ( 186km/h ) next year			1
it has already undergone various road and wind tunnel tests			1
this test was carried out in @entity20 earlier this week			0
the luge , pictured , is 9.84ft ( 3 metres ) long and is fitted with two jet thrusters the record for the world ’s fastest street luge was set by @entity26 on the set of @entity29 ’s 200th episode in @entity30 , @entity31 , in 2011			1
fellows goes by the stage name @entity34 the cowboy and is a tv stuntman from @entity20			0
he claims the board is a complete redesign of the streetluge dubbed @entity40			2
it is made from carbon fibre with a full carbon fibre fuel cell			0
at 9.84ft ( 3 metres ) long , the luge has also been referred to as a ‘ man - sized ’ skateboard controlled using a thumb accelerator , and lean steer turning			1
fellows claims his jet - powered street luge , also called @entity40 , pictured , is capable of reaching speeds of up to 311mph ( 500 km / h )			1
it has additionally been dubbed a ' man - sized skateboard ' the thumb - controlled wheel increases or decreases power by rolling a thumb over it to control speed			2
this wheel can be set at a pre-determined speed , or used as a dynamic accelerator			0
alternatively , the luge can be fitted with a trigger grip control where the rider can use their pointer finger to control acceleration			2
at full power , the turbines , pictured , produce 200lbs ( 91kg ) of thrust each , and afterburners on the tail add an extra 35 per cent to 43 per cent thrust			1
fellows hopes to beat the current world record of 115.83 mph ( 186km/h ) fellows , pictured , goes by the stage name @entity34 the cowboy and is a tv stunt man from @entity20			1
he claims the board is a complete redesign of the streetluge , pictured			0
it is made from carbon fibre with a full carbon fibre fuel cell the entire powered system is routed to a kill switch cable attached to the rider , and in the event of an emergency the cable is pulled free and everything shuts down			2
a secondary unit is positioned behind , and in the event the rider can not see , a second person can hit that button and shut the entire system down			0
fellows became involved in , and was one of the original founders of , street luge in @entity3 1996			1
the luge , pictured left , features lean steer turning			0
a wheel increases or decreases power by rolling a thumb over it to control speed			0
alternatively , the luge can be fitted with a trigger grip where the rider can use their pointer finger to control acceleration			2
it was designed and assembled by @entity10 over 18 months following further wind tunnel tests , pictured , fellows will attempt to break the world record between april and august 2015			1
by doing it during the @entity3 winter , @entity10 claims it will help keep running temperatures down and maximise thrust output his luge was designed and assembled with his team and involved hundreds of hours of design and testing			1
they have spent the last 18 months building the board from scratch			0
his record attempt will be carried out between april and august 2015			0
fellows claims this is to help keep running temperatures down and maximise thrust output			2
dimensions length : 9.84ft ( 3 metres ) from nose to tail height : 1.4ft ( 0.42 metres ) width : 1.9ft ( 0.59 metres ) with turbines total weight : 72lbs ( 33kg ) the engines maximum thrust ( 5 minute rating ) : 202lbs ( 91kg ) maximum continuous thrust : 176lbs ( 80kg ) engine weight : 29lbs ( 13kg ) fuel tank : approximately 22 litres control lean steer turning			1

@entity3 @entity10 began working on his jet - powered luge last year
he has already put his @entity40 through road and wind tunnel tests
the luge is 9.84ft ( 3 metres ) long and is fitted with jet thrusters
at full power , the turbines produce 200lbs ( 91kg ) of thrust each
@entity194 on the tail add an extra 35 **%** to 43 **%** power
fellows hopes to beat the current world record of 115.83 mph ( 186km/h ) by reaching 311mph ( 500km/h ) towards the end of next year
