he said : ' i take into account four of the wounds and two of the deep wounds were deliberately made by you on the legs			1
' i am therefore giving you credit for the fact that when you used the knife the way you did you were taking care not to inflict life threatening injuries , although i am aware that such injuries can cause death			0
' i can only hope that when you are released from prison you will use your potential and never return to prison again			0
' the court heard the victim had surgery and stitches above his left eyebrow and has ongoing issues with feeling and movement in his legs			2

' attack : the club where @entity9 attacked mr @entity12 and later claimed he had used the knife in self defence the judge accepted that @entity9 had not intended to kill mr @entity12 as the majority of injuries were to the legs			1
but he also pointed to the fact @entity9 , from @entity92 in @entity93 , had two previous convictions for possessing a knife , serving an eight week prison sentence for the second offence in 2007			1
mr @entity18 said : ' i have to take into account the fact that you have previous convictions for possession of a rather similar knife , and i 'm sure you would have been warned in the past if you were to use such a knife again			1

mr @entity18 said : ' i have read your very well constructed letter , and i take into account your expressions of remorse			2

' you have robbed me of the opportunity of giving you a greater discount			0
' the femoral artery , pictured right , is a large artery in the thigh which runs through the groin and supplies blood to the legs			0
due to the need for it to supply blood to the muscles of the legs it is one of the largest arteries in the body and often has the highest blood pressure			0
it is particularly vulnerable due to how close it is to the surface of the skin and , if punctured , the victim can bleed to death in a matter of minutes			0
the axillary artery meanwhile is a large blood vessel which conveys blood to the armpit , the thorax and the upper limb			0
if the axillary artery is cut , a person can bleed to death in one minute or less .			0
