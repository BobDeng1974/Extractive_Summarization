by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:42 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:59 est , 30 december 2013 a wheelchair - bound football fan has become the world ’s first disabled coach in the able - bodied game after receiving a letter of praise from sir @entity9			1
@entity10 , 21 , was born with spinal muscular atrophy which left him struggled to walk a few steps , and by 13 he was in a wheelchair			1
but a passionate football fan and player , he was determined not to let the condition push him out of the game			2
groundbreaking : @entity10 , 21 , refused to abandon the sport he loved when he was put in a wheelchair aged 13 suffering from spinal muscular atrophy career path : he is now a coach for sunday league matches and tournaments in @entity23 honour : hearing about mr @entity10 's goals , sir @entity9 ( right ) , former @entity27 manager , wrote to encourage him			1
the letter ( pictured right ) praises mr @entity10 's goals and fearlessness he studied sports technology at college , and spent the rest of his time pitch - side - at school and at @entity36 with the @entity27 disabled supporters association			1
two years ago , a letter arrived at his home in @entity40 , near @entity41 , from former @entity27 manager sir @entity9 , and it sealed his ambition			1
mr @entity10 said : ' when the chance to play was taken away from me i think it was the only option i had really			1
' i could watch the game but i always wanted to do more than watch it			0
' i did it all the way up to college and then once i got to college they said to me you know so much about sports why do n’t you do sports			2
mr @entity10 admits he questioned his own ability to coach players as he can not play the game himself but he now believes his analysis is strong enough to get him into the @entity60 ' i decided to take them up on that and do sports and then gradually through the sports development course at college i decided to take my @entity67 badges and then basically got into it full time			1
' i had a little bit of doubt before about coaching at that high level obviously having never played the game at a certain level , but when i got a letter from sir @entity9 that was the final piece in the jigsaw			1
spinal muscular atrophy ( @entity79 ) is a genetic disease that causes muscle weakness and progressive loss of movement			1
it occurs due to deterioration in the nerve cells ( motor neurones ) connecting the brain and spinal cord to the body ’s muscles			2
as the link between the nerves and muscles breaks down , the muscles that are used for activities such as crawling , walking , sitting up , and moving the head become progressively weaker and shrink ( atrophy )			2
mental abilities are unaffected by @entity79			0
the most common form is caused by a genetic problem where one copy of the genetic error is inherited from each parent			0
' he congratulated me on my coaching badges and for the kind of goals i had in mind			1
' it was a big honour , he is one of the biggest men in football			2
' i ’m going for it now , nothing will stop me			0
' starting his career , mr @entity10 will coach sunday league teams and tournaments in @entity23 but plans to rise to the top - with @entity27 in his sights			1
he added : ' i do n’t coach a professional team yet , its just sunday league stuff at the moment			1
' my dream job is probably to manage the biggest clubs in the world			0
i would want to manage			0
' any coach or manager who says he is just coaching @entity128 just for the fun of it is lying , because every coach want ’s to coach at the highest level			2
' that ’s the way i am , i want to coach the @entity134 , the @entity135			0
' mr @entity10 , a @entity27 supporter , admitted he often questioned his own ability while training at @entity139			1
he said : ' in the early stages you always have that question , how do you know when you ’ve never played the game ? but i think , in the end of the day , they have the right to ask that			0
' i look at it like there are some managers out there who have n’t played the game , or they played the game at a low level not a high level , like @entity154			0
' the other drawback is obviously i ca n’t demonstrate what i want to teach			0
i get fully into it though , i analyse want i want them to do and go into it with them			0
' i always work round a problem and find a way of doing it			0
i probably am a lot more descriptive than other coaches , there is a lot more planning going into it really			0
mr @entity10 , from @entity40 , near @entity41 , was born with spinal muscular atrophy , which breaks the connection between muscles and nerves there are some practical problems like getting stuck in the mud but he does n't mind ' there are some practical problems as well , you have a wheelchair and muddy pitches to deal with			1
that would stop any other person in a wheelchair , but not me			0
' it gets stuck but i just dig it out and get on with it , you just get in the zone			0
' now i ’ve been told i am the world ’s first wheelchair bound football coach for an able bodied team			2

@entity10 , 21 , was born with spinal muscular atrophy , which forced him into a wheelchair by the age of 13
