by @entity0 published : 12:46 est , 22 january 2013 updated : 14:09 est , 22 january 2013 astronomers have released the first pictures of what they think what a black hole will look like - but admit they do n't yet have to technology to check their theory			1
black holes are invisible , as not even light can escape their gravitational pull			1
but it is believed that the boundaries around them - a point of no return called the event horizon - should be visible from the radiation emitted by matter as it is sucked in			0
@entity19 shape : astronomers from @entity22 have created this prediction of what a black hole looks like based on observations of @entity27 , the black hole at the centre of our galaxy it is that expectation that led @entity33 of the @entity22 to present this image of what a black hole picture could look like at the 221st meeting of the @entity38			1
as the picture shows , it is expected that the first black hole pictures - which will in fact show the boundaries around them - will take a crescent form , rather than the blobby shape they are popularly given			1
' a black hole 's immediate surroundings have a lot of really interesting physics going on , and they emit light , ' mr @entity33 told @entity52			2
' technically speaking , we are n't exactly seeing the black hole , but we are effectively resolving the event horizon			2
' mr @entity33 's picture is not just an exercise in astronomical speculation			0
it is based on a model that astronomers are using to to prepare to interpret the images that will become available from apparatus under construction			0
a new project called the @entity66 will combine observations from a worldwide network of radio telescopes to get data on objects in space that would otherwise be too tiny to see			1
' @entity73 is the first to resolve spatial scales comparable to the size of the event horizon of a black hole , ' said @entity22 astronomer @entity78 , who collaborated with mr @entity33 on the image			1
' i do n't think it 's crazy to think we might get an image in the next five years			0
' this is not what a black hole looks like : a previous artists ' impression of a black hole a black hole is a region of spacetime from which gravity prevents anything , including light , from escaping			2
the theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will deform spacetime to form a black hole			2
around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an event horizon that marks the point of no return			2
it is called ' black ' because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon , reflecting nothing , just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics			0
despite its invisible interior , the presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as light			1
the new telescope has already gathered preliminary measurements of the black hole at the centre of our own @entity125 galaxy , known as @entity27			1
the researchers matched this data to various models and found that they best fit crescent - shaped images rather than the ' asymmetric @entity133 ' blob shape previously used in models			0
this crescent shape reflects that doughnut - shaped disk of matter which orbits a black hole as it is inexorably sucked inside			1
as gas spins around the black hole , the side which points towards observers on @entity141 will appear brighter as a result of a process called @entity146 , while the other side will appear dimmer			1
the centre of the crescent is a dark circle which represents the black hole itself			2
ultimately the researchers hope to use the first pictures of @entity27 to weigh the black hole at the centre of our galaxy			0
they also hope to prove certain aspects of the theory of general relativity that have thus far escaped confirmation			0
nevertheless , mr @entity33 said just getting an image at all will be ' mind - blowing '			0
he told @entity52 : ' it will provide direct confirmation of the event horizon , which has been predicted , but no one 's ever actually seen it			0
seeing what it is like will rule out certain physics			0

invisible black holes are ' imagined ' by *scientists* using boundaries around them
preliminary data from the @entity66 project *suggests* that they will appear crescent shaped from @entity141
when the project is *completed* it will combine observations from radio telescopes to hopefully get the first black hole image
