by @entity0 published : 11:59 est , 18 september 2013 updated : 12:47 est , 18 september 2013 a family judge has ruled that a man who shared a bed with his 13 - year - old step - daughter - and even let her shave his chest - did nothing wrong			1
the step - father was cleared of abusing the girl by the judge at @entity10 after he claimed he got into bed with her when she was feeling ill and lonely , and let her shave him as part of a ' makeover			1
' @entity14 took the case to @entity17 ’s @entity16 in a bid to vindicate the teenager who claimed she was a victim of abuse but those claims were rejected today by the @entity22			1
cleared : three @entity22 judges ruled that the step - father had not done anything inappropriate lawyers for the council and the girl ’s guardian claimed the decision contradicted the evidence and all conventions of decency with children			1
@entity35 , for @entity10 , said the family judge was ' plainly wrong in refusing to find sexually inappropriate behaviour , ' noting that the step - father had admitted sharing a bed with the teen ' on more than one occasion			1
' although the man insisted that nothing inappropriate occurred , but mr @entity43 said he admitted on one occasion ' sharing a bed with her in the absence of her mother , and that he had proceeded to put his arm around her bare midriff			2
' other alleged inappropriate conduct included ' showing an interest ' in the girl ’s pubic hair including joking about it needing a hedge trimmer and allowing the girl to pull down his trousers ' on at least four occasions ' , he added			2
the step - father steadfastly denied misconduct , insisting that his behaviour had to be seen in the context of the family ’s particular domestic life and the teenager ’s own precocious sexuality , behaviour which included exposing herself in public			0
not a victim : the @entity22 supported the original ruling that there were clearly ' poor sexual boundaries in the home ' but the stepfather had not committed abuse ( file picture ) he said the bed - sharing incident occurred when his step - daughter had returned ill from school and was feeling lonely			1
he told the court : ' i believe she asked to shave my chest , in the same way as she used to ask to do my hair or give me a makeover , so i let her do this			0
' as she was still feeling poorly i put my arm around her stomach in order to comfort her and i fell asleep , touching her skin as her top had ridden up slightly			1
' the girl ’s mother arrived home soon after , he explained , adding that he never touched his stepdaughter ' inappropriately or sexually ' and today three top judges said the believed his story			2
the issue of alleged sex abuse was first aired before a family judge in march this year who said that there were plainly ' poor sexual boundaries in the home ' but cleared the step - father of any wrong - doing			1
he made an order that the girl should live with her mother under local authority supervision but rejected all claims of sexual abuse			2
challenging that decision , mr @entity43 argued the teenager deserved a court ruling that would vindicate her claims particularly because of the ' significant emotional trauma within the family			0
' mr @entity43 said : ' she knows that a judge has now found as a fact that she was not abused			0
' if , in truth , she was abused , it is important to her that this should be formally recorded			0
' a reversal of the findings will make a significant difference to her well - being and the coherence and functioning of her family			0
' however , after several hours of intense legal debate , the three @entity16 judges refused the council ’s appeal			0
@entity146 , sitting with @entity144 and @entity145 , said that the court would give full reasons for its decision at a later date			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0

he got into bed to comfort her and fell asleep with his arm around her waist but @entity22 ruled he did not do anything wrong
family judge ruled in march that there were ' poor sexual boundaries in the home ' but the girl was not a victim of abuse
