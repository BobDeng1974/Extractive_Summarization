' they had only been married for a matter of months			0
' he continued : ' the defendant , @entity24 , had agreed to kill @entity44 for money			0
he had agreed to kill her for the defendant @entity14			0
it was he , @entity14 , who had the plan , @entity24 and @entity14 carried out that plan to kill @entity44 with the help of their fellow defendant @entity37			2
' mr @entity70 said @entity14 had wanted mrs @entity1 ' silenced ' because he believed she would make an allegation to police that he had indecently assaulted someone , a complaint she had previously made			1
he said : ' why would @entity14 want @entity44 killed ? the answer to that question , which will remain at the heart of this trial , probably lies in the fact that @entity14 believed that mrs @entity1 was going to go to the police , as she had done before , and allege that he had previously indecently assaulted ( someone )			1
' it was for that reason , principally it seems , that @entity14 wanted @entity44 silenced , so he recruited others to help him			0
' mr @entity70 said mrs @entity1 knew @entity14 because she had been in a relationship with his father @entity84 from about 2006 to 2012			1
he said @entity14 had a ' lasting hate and anger ' towards mrs @entity1 after she made a complaint to police about the allegations of sexual assault against him when he was 14			1
a member of the police forensic team works at the scene of mrs @entity1 ' death at @entity95 in the days following her death mr @entity70 said police took no further action on the complaint and added that @entity14 ' strenuously and consistently ' denied the allegations			1
he said : ' the accusations left @entity14 with a lasting sense of animosity , hatred , towards @entity1			1
it did n't , say the @entity106 , wear off			0
' when @entity107 was about to marry his new love @entity109 in august last year , mrs @entity1 - described as a ' forthright and emotional lady ' - sent messages to his new wife - to - be on @entity113 at 2.20am on august 20			1
in it , she repeated the historical sexual allegations against @entity14 which she had first made back in 2006			1
the messages were then shown to @entity14 and he came to learn the ' strength of feeling ' mrs @entity1 was expressing against him and the threat that she was to return to the police with the allegations			1
mr @entity70 said mrs @entity1 repeated the allegations against @entity14 in august last year after she found out that @entity107 was to marry his new partner , @entity109			1
he said mrs @entity1 sent @entity113 messages to ms @entity109 saying one of the alleged victims of @entity14 would be making a statement to police			1
mrs @entity1 wrote in one message : ' good luck , you will need it , ' and in another : ' i ca n't forgive him , all the shit he gave me , i f * * * * * * hate him and all his family			1
' @entity1 ( pictured ) was tending to her horses in the @entity48 when she was killed , it is alleged mr @entity70 said : ' it was not just spoiling the new family that was starting with the imminent marriage , it was much more than that , she was trying to do something specifically to harm him , to throw his life in utter turmoil with the allegations that he says were falsely made against him			1
' the truth of those allegations matter not a jot			0
when you are simply accused of something like that it touches , in the most difficult way , all parts of your life			0
' @entity14 was going potentially to be labelled			0
people do not look beyond the allegation - it affects your relationships , it affects your own thoughts , it affects job opportunities			0
the list is endless and hugely important			0
it goes on and on			0
' @entity14 , having said from the outset so very clearly and passionately they were not true , being falsely accused of something would have instilled in him an even greater anger and bitterness , you may think			2
' mr @entity70 said : ' so it is that @entity14 came to the conclusion that killing @entity1 was the only means by which he could bring those allegations to an end for once and for all was to have her voice silenced			2
' it was not something he could do alone and he thought enough that because of his background with @entity1 everyone would immediately suspect him			0
' he needed somebody else to plunge the knife on his behalf and that somebody would have to be close enough to him to be trusted			0
police officers working at the scene where mrs @entity1 body was discovered in september last year ' that somebody was selected to be @entity24			1
' the prosecutor said police connected @entity24 to the murder scene as he dropped the keys to @entity37 's car in the field which were later found by officers searching the area			2

he added that @entity24 and @entity14 admitted knowing each other as they had a connection through drugs			2
the prosecutor said @entity14 had promised to pay @entity24 Â£ 1,500 for the killing			1
mr @entity70 said @entity24 told acquaintances that @entity14 had given his reason for the killing that mrs @entity1 had abused him as a child			1
he said @entity24 's reasons for agreeing to carry out the killing were ' money and a misguided sense of right and wrong '			0
mr @entity70 said that analysis of phone records and geo - location technology showed that @entity24 carried out reconnaissance missions prior to the killing which involved following mrs @entity1 from her work at a @entity219 's supermarket in her home town of @entity221 to the field near @entity22 where she kept her horses			1
he said that , afterwards , the phone records showed that @entity24 was in contact with @entity14			2
mr @entity70 said cctv images which captured mrs @entity1 's and @entity24 's cars on september 2 showed that he followed her in a similar way to the field on the day of her death			1
he added that @entity14 provided himself with an alibi for the day of the killing but he did not account for his whereabouts when he drove past her place of work that day			0
the trial , in which both @entity14 and @entity24 deny the charges , is expected to last four weeks at @entity33 ( pictured ) mr @entity70 said : ' he wanted to be with someone , he was with a friend , went to places where there was @entity241 so he would be in a position to say " here , have a look , i am there "			2
what he did n't mention was going to this specific location in his car			0
' he was going to see if @entity1 was there so he knew the first part of the plan was in place			0
' he said mrs @entity1 suffered 13 stab wounds caused by 10 individual strikes which showed that her attacker had a clear intent to kill her			2
but during the attack , it was claimed @entity24 managed to lose the keys to @entity260 's @entity259 in the field			2
mr @entity70 said : ' @entity24 made a grave error			0
he lost the key to the car he travelled to the murder scene so he was stranded			0
' he said @entity24 then phoned his girlfriend , @entity267 , who asked her friend @entity268 to pick him up from close to the nearby @entity269			0
@entity24 told police he had been in the area ' scoping out places to burgle ' , mr @entity70 said			0
he later returned with a friend in a failed attempt to tow the car before returning with another friend with a tow truck who successfully recovered it for @entity37			0
mr @entity70 said @entity24 later confessed to a friend and ' justified ' his actions by saying that he believed his victim was a ' nonce '			0
he then went to stay with friends near @entity285 before going to stay with his brother in @entity287 before he handed himself in			0
@entity37 said in police interview that her phone , which had been used to contact @entity14 following the murder , had been lost and then later said she had lent it to @entity24 and answered no comment to other questions			2
mr @entity70 said that when mrs @entity1 's husband found her lying in the field , he initially thought she might have been sunbathing during a ' pleasant ' afternoon			1
he said : ' he was screaming for help and became understandably hysterically distraught			0
his hysteria and his distressed wailing was heard by nearby farmworkers and they came to his assistance			0
' today , mrs @entity1 ' family - including her distraught husband and sister @entity301 - watched proceedings from the public gallery			1
