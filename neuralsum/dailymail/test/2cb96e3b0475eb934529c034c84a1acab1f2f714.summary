encounters with common dolphins off the @entity2 have more than doubled over a decade , according to experts			1
and now research is under way to find out why , with scientists proposing that climate change may have caused the surge in numbers			2
common dolphins were once a rare sight in the @entity12 , preferring warmer waters found further south , leading experts to believe that global warming has led to pods moving north			1
encounters with common dolphins ( a stock image is shown ) off the @entity2 have more than doubled over a decade , according to a leading research body			1
monitoring by @entity22 and @entity24 teams has seen the number of encounters increase by 68 per cent over the past 12 years monitoring by @entity22 and @entity24 teams has seen the number of encounters with common dolphins increase by 68 per cent over the past 12 years			1
the dolphins come to the @entity12 in spring to take advantage of seasonal food stocks , travelling in large groups and sometimes forming ‘ super-pods ’ of thousands of individuals			1
the species , which are smaller than the area ’s resident bottlenose dolphins , often approach boats and play in the wake , the trust said			0
while they were once drawn to warmer waters above 10 ° c south of the area , climate change is causing sea surface temperatures in the @entity12 to rise by around 0.5 ° c a decade			1
and warmer water species appear to be colonising new areas further north or closer to shore , the trust said			1
the dolphins are moving further north than they did decades ago , possibly because the water has become warmer			2
while the shift could create new feeding opportunities for the common dolphins , it could increase competition between other types of dolphin or seabirds			1
an oystercatcher on the @entity60 is shown the shift north could be creating new opportunities for the common dolphins to find food in new areas , but may mean the species is competing for fish with other types of dolphin or seabirds			1
volunteers will live , work and sleep on @entity73 research ship for up to 12 days			2
they will receiving training and work with scientists to conduct visual surveys , acoustic monitoring using specialist equipment , and cetacean identification through dorsal fin photography			2
they will also help run @entity73 - giving them a chance to learn to sail and navigate			0
areas covered depend on the weather but will range from @entity88 in the south , @entity90 in the north and @entity92 in the west			0
these seas are one of @entity97 ’s most important cetacean habitats			0
participation costs range from £ 683 to £ 1,500 to cover boat expenses , accommodation , training , food and insurance , and support the trust ’s research			0
more information can be found at @entity107			0
colder water species such as the white beaked dolphin could be forced to retreat further north , and while the trust said it had found no evidence of the white beaked dolphin being displaced , continued monitoring of the situation is needed			2
the charity is calling for volunteers to join its research vessel @entity73 to help conduct visual surveys and acoustic monitoring and identification of cetaceans			0
this includes dolphins , whales and porpoises			0
dr @entity128 , sightings and strandings officer at @entity130 and @entity24 said : ‘ an increase in common dolphins means that those wishing to encounter dolphins in the wild are in luck - but further research is needed to explain why this is happening , the extent to which it has been caused by human activity and the implications for other cetacean species			1
’ @entity144 , the trust ’s biodiversity officer , added : ‘ our research expeditions depend on volunteers			0
‘ in return they offer the opportunity of a lifetime to contribute to a better understanding of cetaceans and basking sharks , whilst enjoying the beautiful scenery of @entity158 ’s west coast and experiencing exhilarating sailing			0
the charity is calling for volunteers to join its research vessel @entity73 to help conduct visual surveys , acoustic monitoring and identification of cetaceans - which include dolphins , whales and porpoises - as well as helping to run the yacht			2
a stock image of the crew of the yacht is shown areas that will be covered in the forthcoming survey depend on the weather but will range from @entity88 in the south , @entity90 in the north and @entity92 in the west ( all marked on the map )			0

common dolphins were once rare in the @entity12 , preferring warmer water
but their numbers have risen by 68 per cent over the last 12 years
scientists believe this could be *due* to the waters warming by 0.5 ° c
@entity22 and @entity24 is *recruiting* volunteers for monitoring
