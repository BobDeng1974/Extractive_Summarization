new @entity1 manager @entity0 will meet with @entity2 to thrash out the @entity5 legend ’s future at the club			1
the veteran @entity8 coach will leave the @entity11 squad ’s training base near @entity12 and travel to a secret destination in @entity14 to meet with @entity2 and @entity1 chief executive @entity15			1
@entity16 will officially be unveiled as @entity1 ’s new manager thursday or friday and the club will then reveal who will join the 62 - year - old on the coaching staff			1
@entity16 is expected to offer the 40 - year - old a coaching role at the meeting and will tell him that he wants someone on the staff who knows the club and its players			1
however , whether or not @entity2 decides to stay will depend on whether he thinks the role he is offered is senior enough			2
he has already indicated privately that he will not stick around if he thinks he is not going to be a fundamental part of the set - up			0
@entity16 is currently in the thick of preparing the @entity8 team for a friendly with @entity51 on saturday and the @entity22 finals in @entity53 next month			1
on the block : @entity33 has left and @entity30 and @entity36 are facing questions over their future switch : @entity16 announced his @entity11 team will play a 5 - 3 - 2 at the @entity22 in @entity53 he revealed a shock change in tactics , from the traditional @entity8 4 - 3 - 3 to a seemingly more defensive 5 - 3 - 2 , at a press conference in @entity62 on tuesday — but refused to say much about @entity1			1
‘ that is for @entity1 to comment on , ’ he said			2
‘ no , i would not say anything about it			0
i am here for the @entity8 team , not as coach of @entity1			2
you ’ll have to wait until the process is finished or ( put ) questions to @entity1 — or perhaps to another club			0
i can not say anything further			0
’ the @entity8 players have a day off wednesday , enabling @entity16 to meet with @entity2 and @entity15 to discuss the way forward			1
different directions : @entity33 ( left ) will be cut from the coaching staff , though he has n't been told formally , while @entity30 will have a meeting on thursday to discuss his future role at the club @entity81 will attend a meeting at the club on thursday but @entity83 revealed that @entity33 and @entity34 will not be retained by @entity16 , even though @entity33 was at @entity84 and has still not been informed officially			1
@entity33 and @entity34 got the news minutes after @entity86 was informed by @entity15 his @entity1 career was over in the dressing room at @entity89 on sunday			1
@entity33 was approached by @entity90 as he emerged from the shower			0
he was n’t told he too was finished at @entity5 but he might as well have been			0
@entity15 said there might be a role for him outside the first team ; possibly in the academy			0
woods was then approached outside the dressing room			0
@entity15 told him that another goalkeeping coach was coming in — it is already known @entity16 wants to bring @entity101 from the @entity8 national set - up — and that his first team duties had been terminated			0
bearer : @entity1 chief @entity15 broke the news to @entity33 in the dressing room after sunday 's game @entity96 will also discuss exactly what that means towards the end of this week , but @entity33 and @entity34 certainly believe their time at the club is over			1
the whole episode left @entity2 , his coaches and players , stunned at @entity90 ’s insensitivity			0
when @entity1 do announce @entity16 ’s arrival , it is unlikely there will be a press conference			1
instead , @entity16 will leave @entity90 to work on agreed summer transfer targets and go about his summer business with the @entity11 team			1
@entity15 ’s performance in the transfer market came in for some harsh criticism tuesday from @entity1 legend @entity127			1
critic : former @entity1 skipper @entity127 criticised @entity15 for his transfer policy ‘ why give @entity130 a six - year contract ? he had one transfer window , and it ’s not always down to the manager when players do n’t come in			2
i think @entity15 needs to look at himself			0
he ’s got to get deals done			0
’ and @entity90 could face an awkward time on thursday when @entity1 ’s first quarter financial results are announced			2
there could be some tricky questions from investors over the hiring and firing of @entity130 and the club ’s patchy performance in the transfer market			0
@entity147 thinks it will take @entity1 four transfer windows to turn the club ’s fortunes round			0
he said on @entity152 : ‘ it ’s not a given that @entity1 will be back in the top four , whoever is the manager			1
top target : @entity89 and @entity156 left back @entity157 has been linked with a £ 27m move ‘ it ’s not a quick fix			0
‘ i think it ’s a minimum of four transfer windows — if it goes well — before @entity1 get back to where they want to be and should be			2
i ’m talking about winning big trophies ’ former @entity1 captain @entity167 told @entity152 the club need to be careful who they buy			0
@entity33 said : ‘ if he [ @entity16 ] decides he wants eight players , that does n’t mean he should go and buy eight players			2
switch : @entity174 was involved in the decision to switch @entity11 to a 5 - 3 - 2 formation ‘ signing three or four real top quality — and improving next season , bedding them in and then going again with two or three more the year after , is the organic approach i would expect @entity1 to have			2
‘ however , i did n’t expect @entity1 to sack a manager after ten months , so what ’s going to happen in the next few months , who knows ? ’ what will be of particular interest to @entity1 supporters is the fact that @entity16 involved @entity174 and @entity189 — his captain and vice-captain — in the decision to make the tactical change for @entity11 .			1

@entity0 will meet with @entity2 for crunch talks about the @entity1 legend 's future
the @entity11 boss will leave his @entity22 training base to meet @entity2 in a secret @entity14 destination
@entity16 will officially be unveiled as @entity1 's new manager on thursday or friday
@entity33 and @entity34 will definitely leave the coaching staff
@entity36 and , perhaps , @entity30 will head back to the @entity31
@entity16 is expected to offer @entity2 a role but the @entity209 may not take it
