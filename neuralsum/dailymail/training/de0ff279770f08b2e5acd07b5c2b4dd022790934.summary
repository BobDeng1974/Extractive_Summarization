@entity0 branded @entity1 ‘ fantastic ’ after the @entity3 keeper produced a top - drawer display to earn his side a @entity7 point in @entity8			1
the @entity10 champions twice took the lead in the @entity12 with goals in each half from debutant @entity15 and a deflected @entity17 effort			2
it took a blistering free - kick from @entity8 ’s skipper @entity20 12 minutes from time to salvage a 2 - 2 draw after @entity24 @entity23 had cancelled out @entity15 ’s opener with a wicked deflection off @entity27			1
but the hosts would surely have had all three points but for a sublime @entity1 fingertip stop in the first half and a stunning double save in the second			2
@entity1 produces a stunning save to stop @entity23 getting his second goal for @entity8 ‘ @entity1 ’s performance was just marvellous , ’ said @entity0 , with the @entity37 international fast consigning £ 10million predecessor @entity35 to history			1
‘ i think he has been good all season but he ’s progressing all the time and getting better and better			0
‘ he is a top professional and a fantastic man , a good boy			1
i am so glad to have him in the group			0
‘ before i came to @entity3 i had only seen him on tv when he played for @entity45 so i did n’t know all about him			2
‘ but ( goalkeeping coach ) @entity46 told me he was ready and he is showing he ’s such a fantastic goalkeeper			2
he is back at the level he was at before with @entity46 training him so well			0
he ’s done such a fantastic job , too			0
‘ together they have got back again – and they will keep on going			0
@entity1 has just been a fantastic signing for us			2
we had a fantastic goalkeeper in @entity35 but now we have another one – and a fantastic goalkeeping coach			0
’ @entity3 's @entity1 pulls off yet another brilliant save in a performance his manager called marvellous despite being beaten twice @entity59 keeper @entity1 showed he is back to his best this season @entity1 ’s form has been stunning and he is proving the doubters wrong after returning from two years on the sidelines with a knee injury			1
@entity8 coach @entity64 echoed his opposite number , saying of @entity1 ’s display : ‘ he was fantastic and saved a point for @entity3			1
’ @entity3 were accused of penny pinching after replacing @entity35 with a free transfer , but @entity0 believes the former @entity72 man is making his point on the pitch			1
he is very professional and he knows his body very well			0
he will work all the time but you never know in football - things can happen tomorrow , but so far he has been fantastic and if we keep him fit he will continue to be that			0
@entity1 salutes the @entity3 fans after a superb performance helped his side earn a point in @entity8 ‘ i think we have improved in the back four			1
we have to work on the right side because we had some trouble in the second half , but it was a good performance and the central defenders are working well together			0
‘ @entity91 has been a very good signing and @entity93 ) is improving with every match he plays at a high level			0
that gives me a good feeling			0
’ @entity0 was also delighted with @entity15 ’s debut goal and performance and sees signs of improvement in his team after a dismal double exit from the @entity104 to @entity105 and @entity106			2
‘ i love to work in football to create things and i think now we are progressing			0
we see there is a lot of work to do to get even better			0
@entity0 praised his goalkeeper @entity1 and was pleased with the progress his team are making ‘ i want to control the matches more than we do by controlling the ball , but that will take time			1
we need more fitness and quickness on the ball and that ’s what we are going to work on this year so that hopefully we will be more ready for the @entity104			0
’ meanwhile , @entity17 will today make his own way back from @entity122 - after @entity3 were forced to leave their captain behind in @entity8			1
the closure of the local airport at 11pm local time prompted a @entity3 dash for their flight minutes after the 2 - 2 draw , but goalscorer @entity17 had been called in for a @entity131 drugs test and was unable to produce a urine sample quickly			1
@entity133 was also tested and made the plane in time but @entity17 was less fortunate and will fly home alone ahead of sunday ’s game with @entity138			1
@entity3 captain @entity17 had to be left behind after a @entity131 drugs test took too long to make the team plane			1

@entity3 led twice against @entity8 in opening @entity7 clash
@entity122 hit back both times to earn 2 - 2 draw and @entity1 made several superb saves
@entity3 manager @entity0 describes goalkeeper as ' a top professional and a fantastic man '
captain @entity17 has to make his own way back to @entity37 after *missing* @entity3 team plane for a @entity131 drugs test
