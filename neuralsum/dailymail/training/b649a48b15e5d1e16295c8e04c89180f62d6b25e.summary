by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 and @entity2 follow @ @ @entity3 and @entity4 follow @ @ charliesale sir @entity5 has spoken of his anguish at the way @entity9 ’s sacking was handled by @entity10			1
speaking to an audience of 300 at a charity lunch in @entity13 , @entity5 said he found it ‘ upsetting the way it came out ’			1
@entity9 learned of his imminent sacking when the story broke on monday afternoon — 16 hours before he was officially informed by the club			1
@entity10 ’s handling of the situation might cost them dearly when it comes to negotiating @entity9 ’s exit terms			1

their chief executive @entity36 said : ‘ the @entity32 is very disappointed with the nature of @entity9 ’s departure			2
’ old guard : @entity40 ( left ) has taken over until the end of the season and is being assisted by @entity43 that view was endorsed on thursday by @entity46 manager @entity45 , an @entity32 committee member , who called the process ‘ flawed ’ and ‘ a great shame for @entity9 and for @entity10 ’s brand ’			1
it is highly significant that the @entity32 will not comment further until @entity9 ’s compensation deal has been finalised			2
it is understood the 50 - year - old believes @entity10 delayed sacking him to save millions of pounds in compensation			1
the axe fell two days after defeat at @entity27 , which meant @entity10 could no longer finish in the @entity58 places			0
@entity9 has told friends he believes this was motivated by a clause in his contract stipulating that failure to finish in the top four would limit his pay - off to £ 4.5million — a year ’s money			2

@entity10 maintain they did everything by the book and have adhered to stock - market regulations			0
a club spokesman said : ‘ we do not accept that it was handled in an unprofessional manner			0
the decision was not taken until late monday night and was communicated face - to - face first thing on tuesday morning			0
