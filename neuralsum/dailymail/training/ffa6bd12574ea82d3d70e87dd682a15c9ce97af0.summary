for most animal lovers , the fleeting dream of owning their very own wolf pup will never become a reality , but one @entity6 artist may have come up with the next best thing			1
pictured in a range of poses , artist @entity8 , 21 , creates frighteningly realistic handmade animal cubs that are so lifelike they have even fooled people into thinking they are real			1
inspired by the @entity16 wildlife that surrounded her childhood home , she turns some of the cutest creatures around , such as wolf pups , baby otters and baby pandas , into bizarre looking dolls			1
this baby panda sculpture has painted beads for eyes and synthetic fur wrapped around a flexible skeleton once completed , the baby animal sculptures are then sold on @entity8 ' ebay account for hundreds of dollars a close up of one of @entity8 ' baby fox sculptures , for which she receives hundreds of requests a day a baby wolf pup pictured in a lifelike pose			1
@entity8 ' creations have attracted @entity41 design studios @entity43 sculptures such as this normally sell from anywhere between $ 800 ( £ 475 ) and $ 5000 ( £ 3000 ) having never attended a single art class , she is entirely self taught and combines sculpture , synthetic fur and stuffing wrapped around a posable skeleton to produce the bizarre - looking soft toys			1
she also paints white beads to make the eyes as true to life as possible , hand dyes the fur and even adds weights to create the sensation of holding a real life animal			1
after spending the last eight years perfecting her craft , she has now started a worldwide phenomenon and receives hundreds to thousands of requests from people wanting to buy her sculptures everyday			1
in an effort to keep up with demand , the creations are auctioned on her aptly named ' @entity71 ' page , where fans pay anything from $ 800 ( £ 475 ) to $ 5000 ( £ 3000 ) to purchase their very own creepy critter			2
she said : ' since i grew up in the woods of @entity16 , i would see wild animals every day			2
a white lion cub , sculpted into a curled up stance - much like a real cub when being nurtured by its mother the sculptures initially took weeks to make but are now created much quicker			2
pictured is a baby otter demand for the sculptures - such as this wolf pup - has skyrocketed with orders coming from across the world the animals are available for purchase from @entity92 on what she has aptly named ' @entity95 ' ' whether it was a family of eagles nesting right outside my window , wild swans that lived on our lake that became so used to me being there , they would come when i called and let me pet them or even the moose that would eat the carrot noses off my snowmen			1
i wanted to sculpt the animals i was seeing			0
' this is what inspired me to create animals as realistic as i experienced them in life			2
' each animal varies on how long it takes to make , when i first started it took weeks and weeks working all day			0
' but it does not take as long now that i 've made over 400 animals , it 's become muscle memory			0
' however , because every single animal is made with such care and attention , it still takes a very long while			0
' i had no artistic ability at all until i turned 13 and i 've never had any lessons of any kind			0

she said she felt ' incredibly blessed ' the animal creations had brought such ' joy and excitement ' to so many people ' this was when i made my first animal sculpture , it did n't have the synthetic fur or posable skeleton but it won in an art contest and even sold the same day			1
' i receive hundreds to thousands of commission requests every day , and due to the mass , i only sell these creatures through what i call ' @entity71 ' where i let the people decide what each one - of - a - kind animal is worth			2
' when i first started making these animals purely for my own delight , i had no idea they would erupt practically over night as a world wide ' must have ' , i was so shocked and it was a little overwhelming			0
' my animals have also been noticed by the film company @entity175 , who are the makers of the @entity178 movie , as well as the film company @entity179 who are the creators of @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183			0
