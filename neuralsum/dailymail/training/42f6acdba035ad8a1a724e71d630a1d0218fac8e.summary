by @entity1 reporter a decorated @entity3 pilot turned @entity5 candidate from @entity6 who once went down over @entity8 is catching heat from fellow soldiers over claims he 's a hero			1
@entity13 , 39 , was awarded the @entity3 's highest honor for piloting prowess after he skillfully maneuvered to land his damaged spy plane in april 2001 , but as the midterm elections heat up , critics are becoming more vocal in decrying his decision as counter to centuries of @entity3 tradition			1
' once they landed on land , it was @entity27 property			1
you should n't surrender it , ' prominent naval analyst @entity28 told the @entity31			0
hero ? a decorated @entity3 pilot who 's turned himself into a @entity34 hopeful in @entity6 is facing questions about the 2001 crash landing in @entity8 that made him a hero disaster averted ? @entity13 , seen here hugging his girlfriend after returning home from being held in @entity8 for 11 days , piloted a nearly unflyable spy plane to safety in @entity8 in 2001 according to some of the @entity34 's detractors , @entity13 was wrong when he piloted the surveillance plane , which had collided with a @entity8 fighter plane , onto @entity8 's island of @entity48			1
some of them believe he should have flown the plane and all its 23 crewmen into the @entity52			1
' our standing order was " if you ca n't get back to the carrier , you put it down in the water , ” ' said long - serving @entity3 pilot from @entity6 @entity60			1
' in the 20 years i was flying — any aircraft — you were n't going to take it into @entity8 , ' @entity60 told the @entity31			1
@entity13 and his crew began destroying sensitive gear and surveillance devices as soon as it became clear they were going in for a landing at @entity48			1
' i would not have let ( the @entity8 ) take that airplane			2
i would have left it a smoldering hulk , ' said @entity28			0
@entity13 and his crew ultimately surrendered to armed @entity8 soldiers			1
they destroyed what they could , though they could n't get it all and the plane wound up in the hands of the @entity8			1
' this is , like , the worst armchair quarterbacking in the history of quarterbacking , ' @entity13 says of his naysayers			2
' my job was to bring my crew home , safely and alive at that point			0
that 's what i did			0
i did n't want anyone getting shot			0
that would n't do any good			0
' he and his crew were released after being detained 11 days			0
the pilot became a media darling and was invited to dinner at the @entity102 for dinner and mentioned in several speeches made by @entity105			2
but in addition to his decision to land in @entity8 , @entity13 is being attacked for his continued references to his naval record and accomplishments as part of his campaign			1
according to the @entity31 , @entity13 writes in a fundraising mailer : ' i set an undisputed world record by flying a nearly un-flyable @entity116 for nearly two miles — with no instruments and only 50 % power			2
' did the right thing ? now that he 's running for @entity5 , some detractors -- many of them military vets -- are saying he broke with centuries of @entity3 tradition by allowing the plane to land in the hands of the @entity8 that does n't sit well with vets like retired @entity130 brigadier general @entity129			1
' all these people who came back from @entity133 , nobody ever bragged about their experiences			0
this is bragging , ' said ' i 've never seen this kind of behavior from an officer in the military			0
' but @entity13 refuses to apologize to men like @entity129			2
' i flew combat missions in @entity143			0
i flew combat missions in @entity144			0
it is absolutely a big part of my campaign , ' @entity13 said			2
and he says it 's more important now than ever before that candidates like him make it into @entity151			0
' we have the lowest number of veterans in the @entity5 in the history of this country , ' he said .			0

@entity13 saved 23 crewmen in 2001 when he landed a badly damaged spy plane in @entity8 before being taken *prisoner*
