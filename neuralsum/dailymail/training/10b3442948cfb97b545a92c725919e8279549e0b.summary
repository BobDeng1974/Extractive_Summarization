by @entity0 @entity1 vanished on her way to school when she was ten and was held captive for eight years a top policeman assigned to probe the murky @entity1 kidnapping case in @entity7 - who was ruled to have killed himself because of personal problems - did not commit suicide , it was revealed in @entity10			1
the findings on @entity12 , 59 , once again cast doubt on the theory that the @entity16 kidnapper @entity15 acted alone			1
miss @entity1 vanished on her way to school in @entity10 in 1998 when she was ten			1
@entity15 carved a secret , sound - proof cellar beneath his home in a suburb of the city in which to keep her captive for eight years			0
long considered the victim of a paedophile who had murdered her , miss @entity1 finally escaped in august 2006			2
@entity12 was a career officer who never worked on the original investigation but was dragged into the toxic soup of allegation and counter-allegation following the setting - up of the @entity31 - a body tasked to see if others were involved in her vanishing in 1998			1
six months after the probe ended , in june 2010 , he was found shot dead in on the terrace of his home in @entity39			0
@entity15 ( pictured left ) held @entity1 captive for eight years			2
miss @entity1 vanished on her way to school in @entity10 in 1998 when she was ten his service pistol was found near his body with a bullet missing from the chamber and police ruled a suicide			1
but his brother @entity46 never believed it and hired forensic expert @entity48 to investigate the case			1
@entity50 always maintained his brother was murdered because he carried on investigating the case and was convinced there had been a high level establishment cover up to protect the identity of @entity56 's accomplice			2
@entity58 's report shows clearly how poorly the original investigation into his death was carried out			2
@entity1 was held prisoner at this house in @entity63			2
@entity15 carved a secret , sound - proof cellar beneath his home in a suburb of the city in which to keep her captive for eight years @entity1 , pictured in february at the premiere of 3,096 days , the film based on her book a bullet hole in @entity12 's wall which is supposed to have been from the gun he used to kill himself turned out to have been a hole made from a screw where a washing line had been fitted			1
police claimed that the bullet had probably passed through the wall - but there was no exit hole			0
in addition there were traces of gunpowder from the shot on both of the dead man 's hands â€“ as if he had been trying to hold the gun in what would have been a typical defensive move			0
if he had simply shot himself with his right hand this would have meant the traces from the shot would have been only on one hand			0
in fact there were more traces on his left hand than his shooting hand			0
prior to that there were many other indications that the death was not suicide , including the fact that his brother insists that the handwriting on the farewell note was not his brother 's			1
a handwriting expert that examined the dead man 's signature on his police expenses claims confirmed that the was no way the two handwriting styles had been written by the same person			0
before his death he had pleaded for the @entity1 case to be reopened - without success			1
the case was closed according to the official announcement on 8 january 2010			0
but privately he continued to work on it , including a number of interviews that he carried out which he had been forbidden to do as a police officer			0
one of the key areas @entity12 looked at was that the suicide of @entity15 in the hours after she escaped from his lair outside @entity10 in august 2006 after over eight years in captivity			1
found dead under the wheels of a train , he always believed he was pushed to his death .			0

@entity12 , 59 , was ruled to have killed himself
but his brother *disputed* the suicide theory and hired an investigator
before his death he had pleaded for the @entity1 case to be reopened
