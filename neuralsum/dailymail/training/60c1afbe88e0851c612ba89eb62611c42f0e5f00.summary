for @entity3 , the honour of hosting the start of the @entity2 presents a unique opportunity to showcase its beautiful countryside and historic towns			1
with hundreds of thousands of visitors expected to be in ‘ @entity3 ’ next weekend for the @entity2 ’s first two stages , what better chance for the local tourist industry to show off that famous @entity13 welcome			1
but not everyone is so thrilled with the imminent arrival of the world ’s biggest cycle race and the huge influx of visitors that entails			2
uphill struggle : riders tackle @entity21 on @entity3 's tour route stunned locals have been warned that the @entity2 could bring with it a crime wave at the hands gangs of thieves			1
residents are being urged , among other measures , ‘ to consider digging a trench ’ across their driveway to stop criminals with vehicles gaining access to their land			0
the warning , circulated on the internet and by email , also claims the area ’s low crime rates could be ‘ decimated over a couple of days ’ unless action is taken			1
the first two stages of the @entity2 – dubbed the @entity43 – are being held in @entity3 on saturday and sunday before the race moves on to @entity45 , bringing in millions of pounds of extra revenue for local businesses			1
however , the controversial email – attributed to @entity50 neighbourhood watch chairman @entity49 and sergeant @entity51 of @entity52 – warns that ‘ with the significant increase in numbers of visitors and enthusiasts there is evidence that there will be many criminals amongst them ’			1
it continues : ‘ our enviable record of the lowest level of criminality could be decimated over a couple of days unless we can support our police			2
‘ the amateur thief can gain access to your property if doors or windows are left unlocked or open – keep them locked even if you are at home			0
’ @entity77 won the @entity2 in 2012 , bringing a new wave of cycling interest to the @entity80 and ‘ rural members ’ have been told thieves with vehicles could steal quad bikes and other valuables			0
‘ if it is feasible do consider digging a trench across points of entry or creating other obstructions , ’ the email advises			0
@entity52 last night insisted the warning was written solely by mr @entity49 , 74 , a retired company director , who said yesterday that he stood by the advice			1
but @entity94 , the leader of @entity95 , which covers an area of the @entity97 on the race route , slammed the email as ‘ bonkers ’			2
he said : ‘ it ’s one of the most unfortunate emails i ’ve heard about in 20 years as a councillor			0
‘ i hope that everybody simply disregards it because all we want to do is welcome the very large number of visitors who are coming here not to steal , not to vandalise , they are coming here to have a really good time			0
‘ we could do without this kind of bilge and scaremongering , it is absolutely bonkers			0
’ a spokesman for @entity119 said : ‘ we are not expecting marauding gangs of thieves			0
