a @entity1 man discovered a huge sinkhole which had opened up just metres from his home late last week after he heard the sound of the earth collapsing in on itself			1
@entity7 resident @entity6 told @entity8 he was alerted to the hole when he heard a ' rumbling kind of like distant thunder '			2
' ca n't be thunder , it 's dry season , ' mr @entity6 said , before he revealed that when he ventured out into his backyard a few days later he realised something was wrong when he came across a large crack in the earth			2
mr @entity6 likened it to the famous scene from @entity27 where @entity29 's character bragged , ' that 's not a knife , this is a knife ' , and laughed that he now had the biggest sinkhole			0
in a video posted to @entity35 mr @entity6 walked less than 50 metres from the back of his home and stood at edge of the gaping hole , which swallowed trees and boulders			1
mr @entity6 told @entity8 he watched enourmous boulders swallowed by the water at the bottom of the hole his footage shows the sheer size of the sinkhole , estimated to be 40 metres wide and drop down 15 metres to the point where it 's filled with water			1
' that , is a big hole , ' mr @entity6 narrated			0
' i have no idea how deep that water is , but from the rocks that are still falling in to it ... we 're seeing massive boulders slide down and disappear underneath the surface so it 's obviously very deep , ' he continued			0
trees as tall as 20 metres which once stood tall where the hole now lies are nowhere to be seen , and experts are unsure whether the gap will continue to expand			0
before he reached the hole , mr @entity6 found a long fissure in the earth the sinkhole absorbed everything around it and experts are unsure whether it will continue to expand neighbour @entity74 told the program he was extremely grateful the gap did n't appear on his property , where he keeps his collection of 24 old @entity79			1
' they 're 30 , 40 year old @entity79 , i 've got 24 of them ... i do n't really want to lose them , not in a great big hole , ' mr @entity74 laughed			0
at the end of the @entity35 video , mr @entity6 summed up his new backyard feature in one word : ' amazing			2
