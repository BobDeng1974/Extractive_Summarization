by @entity0 many of us take to @entity3 and @entity4 to share our excitement when we have good news			1
but bad news is different			1
whether it be a break up , job loss or illness , a phone call is still our preferred choice of communication			0
now a recent study has found , despite the popularity of social media , we still deliberately choose traditional forms of communication when our news will have a negative impact			1
when experiencing negative events , people could justify interrupting their friends and preferred using the telephone , a more intrusive medium			0
' you often hear people say when the phone rings , it 's bad news , ' professor @entity24 says			1
' our data support that ' this could be down to the fact that sharing bad news on social media makes us feel worse , while sharing good news gives us a high as it makes the event feel more ' real '			1
the study , conducted by the researchers at the @entity39 , @entity40 , involved looking at the sharing habits of 300 undergraduate students at the university			2
all participants kept a daily journal to document how they shared their emotions , how they shared it and how they felt when the incident occurred			0
the study found that 70 per cent of all social sharing was through social media , texting or phone calls , and in person			1
@entity54 sharing is very widespread , says study author @entity55 , an assistant professor of communication arts			2
' it 's almost like the event is not even real until you tell somebody , ' she says participants shared positive news across several forms of media , such as through texts or @entity3 , because the information spreads quickly , and gets a response quickly			1
next time you 're in a bad mood , do n’t turn to @entity4 to cheer you up			2
research has revealed that the longer you spend procrastinating on the social networking site , the more miserable you will become			0
this is because we recognise we 're wasting our time on the site , and this lowers our self - esteem			0
the research contradicts @entity4 ’s own controversial study , published last month , which revealed posts on the site can have a positive and negative effect			2
for the more recent experiment , a total of 300 @entity85 and @entity86 - speaking participants were asked by researchers from the @entity89 to take two tests to see how @entity4 affected their mood			0
in the first , they were asked how much time they had spent on @entity4 that day , before being asked to rate their mood			0
the second study asked some of the participants to spend 20 minutes on @entity4 doing typical things such as checking their news feed and updating their status			1
a second group browsed the web , but did not use social networks , while a third was given no instructions			0
all three groups were asked to rate how ‘ meaningful ’ their overall experience had been			0
the findings revealed that in both experiments , people said they felt worse about themselves after using @entity4 , because they did not feel it was a good use of their time			1
when it came to bad news , participants preferred calling instead of posting their feelings for the world to see			1
@entity54 sharing is very widespread , says study author @entity55 , an assistant professor of communication arts			0
' it 's almost like the event is not even real until you tell somebody , ' she says			0
the study found that participants strategically chose the media that could meet their psychological needs			1
when experiencing positive events , people preferred to share via texting and @entity3 , because both media are easily accessible from smartphones and are nonintrusive in that friends do n't have to reply immediately			2
when experiencing negative events , people could justify interrupting their friends and preferred using the telephone , a more intrusive medium			0
' you often hear people say when the phone rings , it 's bad news , ' professor @entity24 says			1
' our data support that			0
' the researchers also found that social sharing via media enhanced the emotional tone of the event			1
sharing a positive event increased its impact , an effect known as capitalisation			0
' telling somebody makes you even happier , ' professor @entity24 says			0
but if you feel sad because you had a lousy trip to the dentist or a fight with your spouse and post something about it on @entity4 , you will not feel better			2
regardless of which form of media people in the study used to share bad news , they felt worse - though sharing by telephone had the smallest negative effect ' when something positive happens , you want to tell it right away , ' professor @entity24 says			1
' examining how people share their important personal events through new media and how they feel as a result of it is a golden opportunity to learn how humans work			2

study found people prefer to use the phone when they have bad news
good news , meanwhile , is usually shared via @entity4 , text or @entity3
people strategically chose the media to meet their psychological needs
sharing news on social media makes event feel more ' real ' , study claims
