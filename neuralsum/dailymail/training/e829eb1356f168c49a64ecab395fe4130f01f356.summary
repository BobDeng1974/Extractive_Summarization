@entity0 with @entity1 the orphaned wombat he 's a tiny , bright - eyed bundle of grey fluff enveloped in fleecy blankets , clutching a battered soft toy in place of his mother			1
@entity10 the koala – the youngest and most vulnerable orphan at @entity12 in southern @entity13			1
countryfile presenter @entity15 's breath is quite taken away as she settles little @entity10 in her arms			1
his tiny face looks into hers and then towards the camera			1
you can almost see him smile			1
he is , quite simply , one of the cutest animals ever to grace a television screen			1
' @entity10 's so loveable because he 's just like a baby teddy bear , ' says @entity0			1
' he 's so tiny			1
everyone is going to fall in love with koalas once they 've seen him			1
' the 36 - year - old flew @entity29 to film the two - part nature 's @entity30 , in which she meets animals who 've lost their mothers in traffic accidents , dog attacks and other tragedies			1
the charismatic cast includes koalas , wallabies , kangaroos and wombats , as well as anteaters and sloths in @entity45 , visited by @entity0 's co-host @entity46			1
the other stars are the human foster mums dedicated to saving the animals and reintroducing them to the wild – and cuddling is vital to survival			1
with marsupials such as kangaroos , the babies , called joeys , spend their first six to nine months in their mother 's pouch feeding and growing , which forges an incredibly deep bond			1
the orphaned joeys ' need for contact is so great that carers must provide it simply to keep them alive			2
' @entity64 and kangaroos are known as heart - breakers to the staff because they 're very difficult to keep alive , ' @entity0 explains			1
' the stress of being separated from their mothers takes a huge toll on their physiology			1
' @entity72 of @entity73 , near @entity74 , has a cot in her bedroom for her youngest charges			2
its current occupant is @entity80 the swamp wallaby – five weeks old when his mum was hit by a car			2
he survived , cushioned by her body , and was plucked from her pouch			2
when he cries at night , @entity72 holds @entity80 in his cloth pouch so he can hear the sound of her heart , as he would have done in his mother 's pouch			2
when he 's stronger , he 'll be paired with other wallabies to get used to life in a group			2
danny the orphaned @entity94 with his look - a - like teddy @entity72 tips @entity80 out of his pouch occasionally – like his mother would have – so he learns to stand on his own two feet			1
eventually , he 'll bounce along at up to 30mph but right now , staying upright is tricky enough			2
the wobbly wallaby leans on @entity0 's hand , but still inadvertently reenacts @entity101 on ice			2
' it was surreal , charming and highly amusing , ' @entity0 says			2
' it was like a human baby learning to walk : that trust , the need to hold on and the tentative nature of those first steps			0
they tire quickly and fall over			0
it 's wonderful to see			0
you 'd have to be on a stakeout for months in the wild to see that			0
' the charismatic cast includes koalas , wallabies , kangaroos and wombats , as well as anteaters and sloths in @entity45 like @entity80 , @entity10 the koala was found by the road			0
terribly weak , he ran up the leg of the motorist who stopped to rescue him			0
he 's bottle - fed every two hours and will be looked after for at least a year – first indoors , then in an enclosure where he 'll learn to climb trees			1
after that , the bush beckons			0
@entity131 as he is , @entity10 is n't the orphan who touched @entity0 's heart most , though			0
' that was probably @entity1 the wombat , ' the presenter admits			0
' she had a great character			0
they 're known as the bulldozers of the bush and are quite confident			0
@entity1 charged about the house head - butting and knocking things over			1
she had to be taken for walks in the garden to get her used to the outside			0
she follows sound , so you 'd walk away and stamp your feet and she 'd come charging after you , bound into your legs and start investigating			0
' what surprised @entity0 most , though , was the extent to which the carers were prepared to sacrifice their lives			0
' they 've dedicated their lives to caring for these orphans , ' she says			0
' they 'll be woken through the night and do n't get paid			0
all this care goes into one animal , and then they have to send it out into the wild not knowing how it 's going to cope			0
but you know the likelihood of them surviving otherwise would 've been virtually zero			0
' @entity165 's @entity30 , later this month , @entity166 .			0
