@entity0 has blasted @entity1 for their role in getting @entity3 sent off in their @entity4 last 16 second leg encounter on wednesday night and has warned the @entity6 that referees will be wiser to their antics in future			1
@entity3 was dismissed during the first half after challenging for a 50/50 ball with @entity1 midfielder @entity12			1
the tackle by the @entity16 star left the @entity17 international in heap as his team - mates clamoured to the referee for the 33 - year - old to be sent off			2
@entity0 has criticised @entity1 's part in @entity3 red card against them on wednesday night @entity3 's ( right ) challenge on @entity1 midfielder @entity12 earned the @entity16 striker a red card @entity3 ( centre ) holds his hands up after the challenge as the @entity1 players begin their protests @entity1 's players surround referee @entity35 as he sends off @entity3 ( second right ) in the first half @entity36 ( centre ) led the protests as he screamed at the referee following @entity3 's first - half challenge @entity6 striker @entity41 makes a beeline for @entity3 as the referee raises the red card @entity3 has since condemned @entity46 's side as ' babies ' and @entity0 has sympathy for the striker			1
writing in his column for the @entity53 , the former @entity51 midfielder believes @entity1 's pressuring of referees over decisions has been a recurring theme this season and the west @entity60 outfit need realise when they have gone too far			1
' i could tell that he [ @entity3 ] knew he was going off when he looked up and saw every single outfield @entity1 player around the referee telling him to get his red card out			2
@entity1 have been doing it all season – if it is not the players trying to referee the game , then @entity46 does it from the touchline , ' @entity0 wrote			0
' i accept that at @entity51 , we could also pressurise the referee at times and the picture of @entity76 being backed into a corner is often held up in evidence			0
but we realised that it had become too extreme and from that point there was much less of it			0
@entity1 would not be the first team to pressurise a referee but they have to know when they have gone too far			0
' when @entity41 is rushing from 60 yards away to get involved in the argument then that is a sign that things have got out of hand			0
against @entity16 the tactic worked in getting @entity3 dismissed , but it became so extreme that referees will be prepared for it in future			2
they will have it highlighted in their preparation and they wo n’t want to make the same mistake that @entity35 made on wednesday			0
' former @entity51 midfielder @entity0 believes referees will note @entity1 's antics in future now @entity51 infamously hounded referee @entity102 ( left ) after he awarded a penalty against them in 2000 the referee ( centre ) is almost completely hidden from view as the @entity1 players make their case @entity3 called @entity1 ' babies ' for their reaction to the challenge which led to his first - half dismissal			1
