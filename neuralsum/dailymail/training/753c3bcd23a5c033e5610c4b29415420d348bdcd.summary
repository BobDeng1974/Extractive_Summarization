as the autumn sun shone down and the ear - splitting sounds of pipes and drums from thousands of @entity7 marchers filled @entity8 , the @entity1 tourists could not have been happier			2
‘ this is so fabulous , ’ said @entity9 , a film location scout , smiling as her husband snapped away with his camera at loyalists parading along the @entity14 in their bowler hats and banners			2
‘ we are watching history in the making on our holiday			2
there are just 100 hours to go until voting starts in the independence referendum that will define @entity25 ’s future , yet it remains impossible to determine if we are witnessing a seismic moment in our island ’s story			1
but the result – the future of a 307 - year - old union – remains poised on a knife - edge			2
the latest poll released yesterday by @entity47 gave the no camp an eight - point lead , showing a recent barrage of warnings from business leaders and economists may have tilted the balance			2
but their rivals @entity56 insisted results from 25,000 canvas daily returns gave them a majority			2
and , confusingly , another poll showed the @entity56 campaign eight points in the lead instead of behind			1
last night this astonishing battle for @entity25 intensified as the no campaign warned that with five days left , nationalists had not answered key questions on jobs , pensions , public services and the pound			1
@entity73 , the former @entity74 chancellor leading the campaign to preserve the @entity25 , said the referendum was the biggest decision most @entity37 would ever make – yet critical issues were not resolved			1
‘ we still do n’t know with five days to go what currency we would have , ’ he said			0
‘ how confident can we be that our public services will be funded ? ’ his campaign , which saw a 22 - point lead wiped out , has been accused of lacking energy to counter the romantic appeal of independence			1
but @entity87 insisted he was confident of victory with the support of ‘ the silent majority ’ – and even displayed a rare burst of passion			0
‘ if we vote to leave by just one vote then that is it			0
if we leave , there is absolutely no going back			0
it is not just for a generation but for our children ’s children			0
’ @entity73 , the former @entity74 chancellor leading the campaign to preserve the @entity25 , said the referendum was the biggest decision most @entity37 would ever make – yet critical issues were not resolved the stumbling no campaign has been hampered by personal feuds among key @entity74 figures			1
the @entity107 are so reviled in @entity37 they have taken a back seat , even though there is so much at stake the vote potentially threatens the prime minister ’s future			1
but yesterday @entity114 , re-invigorated by this referendum after his dismal days in @entity116 , delivered another fiesty speech in his @entity119 constituency			1
‘ none of us here should allow it to be said that anybody who votes no is less patriotic and less proud of our country			0
we are patriotic @entity37 with a patriotic vision for the future			1
’ there is anger among many supporters of the union at the way @entity133 leader @entity132 has portrayed the independence vote as a struggle between @entity37 and @entity136			1
‘ i am @entity37 and proud of it , so who is he to tell me that i am unpatriotic by voting to keep the greatest political union the world has ever seen , ’ one @entity8 lawyer said to me			1
‘ i ’m sick of this nationalism which is so divisive			0
’ this came from a man i have known for three decades whom i have never seen so impassioned on a political issue – or so infuriated by a leader			0
it indicated how tensions are rising as this landmark vote comes close			0
@entity132 was on the back foot yesterday over threats of revenge against companies opposing separation , as @entity157 and several phone companies became the latest to warn prices would rise following independence			2
the first minister slapped down @entity162 , a former deputy leader of his party who warned such firms faced ‘ a day of reckoning ’			0
@entity132 said the day after a @entity56 vote would be one of celebration , not reckoning , with opposing sides uniting in ‘ @entity170 ’			0
‘ we must rise above these underhand @entity173 tactics and be confident of the new spirit in @entity37 , ’ he said			1
‘ the people are in no mood to be bullied by big @entity136 government putting pressure on big business to intimidate the people of @entity37			1
’ ' we are patriotic @entity37 with a patriotic vision for the future ' : @entity114 delivered another feisty speech on behalf of the no campaign on saturday @entity186 march during a pro union parade , less than a week before voters go to the polls yet @entity162 kept up his attacks yesterday , accusing @entity191 , @entity192 ’s chief executive who has put out an anti-independence statement , of being ‘ an agent of @entity116			1
’ however a study by @entity196 claimed a vote for separation would go down as one of the great political and economic mistakes of recent history , warning of negative consequences ‘ far beyond what people had imagined			0
’ rather incredibly , the future of the @entity25 hinges this week upon a vote in which only one in 14 of the country ’s citizens will participate			0
it could impact on everything from the economy to our place on the @entity217 @entity216			0
when the referendum was announced in 2011 , polls put backing for independence at under 35 per cent			1
last week a @entity222 poll put @entity56 in front , which woke up those south of the border			0
the @entity7 march – disowned by @entity56 campaigners although the organisation ’s membership in @entity37 is bigger than any political party – underlined this sudden focus on the debate			1
@entity232 , grand master of the @entity233 of @entity234 , told a rally : ‘ to you @entity37 sisters and brethren , this coming week is your chance to defeat once and for all the separatists , the people that want to change your way of life			1
’ another speaker put it in familiar loyalist terms			0
‘ no to independence and no surrender to separatism			2
’ joining the 15,000 marchers were loyalists from @entity252 in @entity253 suits , children from @entity255 dressed as ‘ @entity256 ’ and even a stag party of @entity258 from @entity259			0
‘ we ’re supporting @entity56 to stay part of the @entity25 , ’ said @entity260 , 27 , the bridegroom			0
@entity263 , seven , joined the @entity8 in support of the @entity265 as the parade passed a restaurant draped with @entity56 posters , its owner said their involvement would push moderates into the separatist camp			0
‘ they do n’t seem to realise this campaign is for people like them , to build a new community in @entity37 , ’ he added , shaking his head sadly			1
amid the swirl of claim and counter-claim , it is clear many @entity37 remain confused despite the intensity of debate			1
@entity87 claimed yesterday 500,000 voters – one in eight of those eligible to vote – are still to finalise their decision			0
given the lack of comparative polling data , the reduction of voting age to 16 and the anticipated turnout of 80 per cent , it remains a highly unpredictable contest			2
the appeal of the separatist cause was highlighted yesterday by a prominent @entity173 donor declaring support for independence			2
‘ i look forward to awaken to the dawning of a new @entity37 [ ... ] confident [ ... ] to face the next 100 years and beyond as an independent nation , ’ said @entity303 , founder of the @entity304 of car parks			1
already this ballot has become the biggest political betting event in history , with stakes reaching the same level as the last @entity25 general election and @entity314 presidential contest combined			0
one punter gambled £ 800,000 on a no vote			0
yes @entity37 claimed it will have 35,000 volunteers at 500 street stalls over the weekend in a last push to persuade people , with more than 2.6m leaflets being delivered			1
@entity322 , @entity37 ’s deputy first minister , said they would focus on job - creation and the health service in the final days of campaigning ; few dare point out how the @entity328 costs more and achieves worse outcomes than south of the border			1
@entity322 said : ‘ the @entity56 campaign has been carried along by a flourishing of self - confidence among people in @entity37			1
this means we can say with certainty to people still making up their mind : ‘ let ’s do this			0
’ the world is watching with great interest , especially since @entity345 ’s government holds a similar referendum on independence from @entity348 in two months time			1
@entity350 supporters and @entity352 leader @entity351 have backed independence , while president @entity354 supports the status quo			2
even a no vote looks set to alter the political landscape after the panicked pledge by all three main party leaders to offer ‘ devo max ’ to @entity37			1
this prompted @entity363 ’s @entity362 to demand a ‘ new constitutional settlement ’ for voting at @entity136 on @entity234 matters			2
but yesterday saw signs of a backlash against federalisation in @entity25 with @entity173 mp @entity369 warning that there was no guarantee the promised powers would get through parliament			0
one more thing for those 4m voters to ponder as they enter polling booths from the @entity377 to @entity8 , @entity255 and the borders			0
their decision on thursday could determine all our futures .			0

just 100 hours to go until voting starts in the independence referendum
