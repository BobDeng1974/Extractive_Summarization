way to make an entrance : @entity7 , 23 , arrived at her church wedding in a fire engine after her original transport burst into flames rescue : @entity7 and her wedding party were given a lift by firefighters after her transport , a 1969 vintage @entity11 , began smoking before bursting into flames fire fighters rushed to the scene and managed to extinguish the blaze - even rescuing bottles of champagne from the boot			1
but @entity37 and her wedding party were left stranded without a way to get to @entity40 at @entity41 , near @entity42 , @entity43			0
so the fire fighters offered to give her lift - sweeping her up to the church in style on sunday , complete with flashing blue lights			2
teacher @entity18 , of @entity49 , @entity50 , said : ' i was just laughing at first , i 'm quite a laid back person , i was just thinking " can this really be happening to me ? " ' the firefighters were simply great and we thank them so much for getting me to church			2
' this is one big day we 'll never forget ! ' her groom , @entity56 , 24 , was delighted and relieved to see her - as she finally turned up just 30 minutes late			0

' her father , mr @entity14 added : ' we just did n't know how we were going to get to church			0
' but the fire brigade came to our rescue as they put away their pumps and offered @entity67 and i a lift			0
' we certainly arrived in great style - albeit 30 minutes late ! ' but there was not enough space for all of them in the fire truck so one of the fire fighters transported the bridesmaids in a separate car			1
mr @entity14 continued : ' one of the firefighters had to go in a @entity89 with the bridesmaids and they were over the moon about that			0
' we had a few panic - stricken moments ' but it all worked out ok in the end			0
' the happy couple had two days to recover from their excitement before they jetted off to @entity101 sunshine island @entity99 today on a two - week honeymoon			0
