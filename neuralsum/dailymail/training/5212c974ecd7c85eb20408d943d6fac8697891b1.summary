by @entity0 published : 19:31 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 19:50 est , 14 june 2013 a lawyer for the @entity3 who had an affair with @entity6 ’s barrister played a significant role in the inquiry , @entity1 admitted last night			1
the judge had initially suggested that @entity10 played only a minor role in his inquiry , carrying out work that was ‘ largely mechanical ’			1
but , following revelations that she was paid £ 218,000 for her work between july 2011 and november 2012 , he came under pressure to reveal more about her role			1
affair : @entity22 ' barrister mr @entity21 and mrs @entity23 , a member of @entity1 ’s legal team , claim their relationship did not start until after the inquiry in a letter to the @entity30 mp @entity29 , the judge said she had also played a key role in drawing up lines of questioning used by the inquiry ’s lead counsel @entity33 , as well as questioning witnesses herself , reviewing witness statements and researching areas of the law			1
however the letter said nothing about her role in drawing up the so - called rule 13 letters outlining the inquiry ’s criticisms of the @entity46 before the report was published			1
@entity1 insists the conclusions of his report were his alone			0
but mr @entity29 said the revelations would underline public concern about whether the @entity3 ’s findings could have been compromised by an affair between miss @entity23 , a married mother of two , and @entity55 , a barrister representing mr @entity6 and other celebrities campaigning for regulation of the @entity46			1
miss @entity23 , who became known as the ‘ woman on the left ’ during the televised hearings , was junior counsel in the team led by mr @entity33			1
she went on holiday to the @entity64 island of @entity65 with mr @entity55 in august last year – while the inquiry was being conducted			0
@entity1 admitted that the barrister had in fact had a significant role in the inquiry the pair claim they simply discussed the ‘ possibility of a future relationship and decided against it ’			2
they say they changed their minds later and became a couple after the inquiry ended in december			0
mr @entity29 said : ‘ we now learn that @entity10 did indeed provide important legal advice to the @entity3 , and dealt with witnesses and made assessments of the evidence on behalf of the inquiry			0
this must have had some bearing on the inquiry ’s work , whether she had a formal input into the drafting of the report or not			1
‘ it would be completely inappropriate for someone to carry out these important tasks for an impartial public inquiry while developing such close personal relations with one of the parties ’ barristers to the point that they went on holiday together to contemplate an affair			0
holiday together : the pair went on a break to the island of @entity65 ( pictured ) in @entity64 ‘ i am very surprised that @entity1 has not already taken the many opportunities available to him to make this clear			0
’ in his latest letter , @entity1 again denied that miss @entity23 influenced his final report			2
he said she had ‘ no input into the conclusions or recommendations in the report itself ’			0
in april last year miss @entity23 told people at the inquiry she was helping to draft the rule 13 letters , which set out criticisms of the @entity46 across 120 pages that appeared largely unchanged in the final report later in the year			0
the letters were sent to newspaper editors in mid-august , when miss @entity23 claims she was contemplating an affair with mr @entity55			2
@entity1 ’s latest letter makes no reference to her work in this area , focusing on her work in the early stages of the inquiry			2
he has previously said she merely ‘ assisted in the largely mechanical exercise of collecting and organising the evidence to support the generic criticisms ’ set out in the letters .			0
