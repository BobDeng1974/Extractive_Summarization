severe nicotine poisoning can cause dangerous irregular heartbeat , coma , convulsions , confusion and dizziness as well as prompting the heart to stop pumping blood around the body causing cardiac arrest			0
nicotine can be lethal in adults at doses as low as 40 mg , with the threshold for children likely to be much lower at around 1mg per kg of weight			1
yet nicotine cartridge refills are available in various strengths , ranging from 6 mg / l ( 0.6 per cent ) to 36 mg / l ( 3.6 per cent ) , and at the higher strength , just a few drops could have serious side effects in a child under five			1
the warning came after a toddler was rushed to casualty at the @entity40 in @entity41 and nearly dying after swallowing nicotine from a device			1
the two - year - old vomited after picking up a cartridge containing the chemical and putting it in her mouth			1
the child was given the all - clear after being monitored for several hours			0
figures released by the @entity51 @entity52 ( @entity52 ) earlier this year showed a ' massive rise ' in calls to poison centres related to accidental swallowing of liquid nicotine contained in e-cigarette refill cartridges			1
these rose from one in september 2010 to 215 a month by february 2014 with more than half the calls involved children under the age of five			0
dr @entity63 , who treated the child at @entity40 in march , urged parents to be careful with the refills			1
he also called for more legislation around the safety of e-cigarettes , in a letter to publication @entity71			0
the consultant said : ' our case highlights an important emerging issue related to the use of increasingly popular e-cigarettes			0
' the exploratory nature of young children and the attractive packaging of refills is a dangerous combination likely to lead to a growing incidence of accidental exposure to concentrated nicotine solution			1
' we do n't want to see children die from this , but there is a possibility that they could depending on the concentration of the liquid and the size of the child			2
' in the worst case scenario it could kill a very small child who ingests the substance			0
' two or three drops are enough to cause palpitations , vomiting , dizziness and high blood pressure			0
' dr @entity63 said the girl 's case was the first of its kind seen at @entity40			2
it comes as it emerged a two - year - old was rushed to the @entity40 in @entity41 and nearly died after swallowing nicotine from a device			1
doctors have called for increased safety regulation of e-cigarettes but he said he had researched several incidents of adults needing medical treatment over similar alerts			0
' some refills have screw - cap type lids and others simply snap into the e-cigarette and are a lot safer , ' he said			1
' it is the screw - cap type , which are dangerous and the risk has grown because there are so many products like this being developed by companies			2
' what started out as a beneficial thing has now turned into a risk for children			2
' it can be quite a concentrated solution and there needs to be more awareness around it			0
these refills , which are in colourful attractive packaging , need to be kept away from children			2
' the risk posed by nicotine liquid to children needs to be recognised , acknowledged and acted upon by all			1
this includes public education and legislation to improve the safety profile of e-liquid containers			0
' @entity41 director of public health , dr @entity153 , said : ' e-cigarettes are a new product and , while they are undoubtedly less harmful than traditional cigarettes , they are not without risks			2
' this report clearly highlights the need for regulation and more needs to be done to protect children and young people			0
