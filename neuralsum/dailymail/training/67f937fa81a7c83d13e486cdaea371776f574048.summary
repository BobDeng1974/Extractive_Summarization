the message from the @entity3 fans was all too clear as they crashed to another defeat : ' we want @entity6 out , ' they chanted			2
there was some murmuring of discontent during last week 's narrow 1 - 0 @entity10 win over @entity11 but nothing like this with boss @entity6 also taunted with ' you do n't know what you 're doing ' after he substituted @entity16			2
in the end @entity3 fell to @entity19 's goal just before half - time but it could easily have been a lot more as @entity22 showed they have the fight to stay in the @entity24			1

referee : @entity81 @entity82 : @entity19 ( @entity22 ) attendance : 31,728 see how @entity19 found the net to give @entity22 the lead - and click here for more from our brilliant @entity87 for @entity19 it was a moment to remember , as he drilled home after nemesis @entity64 had failed to clear @entity92 's hopeful cross			1
it came only a month after the former @entity94 left back was sent off – later rescinded – for clashing with the right back at @entity96 and this was another fiery encounter with @entity52 and @entity66 both sent off late			1
@entity50 made only his second start for @entity22 following his summer move from @entity3 as @entity100 opted for an attacking system with @entity55 occupying the other flank and @entity35 and @entity56 operating up - front			1
@entity22 's @entity49 climbs above @entity74 in a spirited @entity104 at the @entity29 @entity3 's @entity75 attempts to block the pass of @entity107 ' @entity106 as @entity22 claims a valuable three points it was the hosts who defied their league position to take control of this game with @entity56 seeing an early shot deflected wide from @entity106 's cross			1
@entity22 really should have taken the lead on 13 minutes from a delightful break			0
@entity55 's powerful long ball was well controlled by @entity50 whose run picked out @entity56 who somehow sidefooted wide with @entity55 also queuing up to score behind him			0
@entity100 's side missed another good chance as @entity56 headed wide from almost on the goal - line as @entity35 headed on @entity55 's cross			0
@entity56 misses a golden opportunity for @entity22 as @entity3 's @entity125 keeper @entity63 makes himself big @entity3 could have capitalised on @entity22 's failure to take advantage of their early chance as @entity75 caught the home defence napping but shot well wide			1
then @entity71 saw an effort deflected into the hands of @entity46 , preferred in goal to @entity61 , from the edge of the area while @entity65 blazed well over from @entity136 's corner			0
but @entity22 finished the half strongly with @entity56 seeing a volley from the edge of the area come back off the bar with the headed rebound from @entity35 going over			2
they got their goal in the first minute of stoppage time to @entity19 's delight			1
it was his fifth goal in 146 @entity107 appearances			0
@entity22 continued where they had left off at the start of the second half with @entity63 spectacularly saving to keep out @entity52 ' header from @entity50 's cross			1
from the resulting @entity52 corner @entity136 's header nearly went into his own net			2
@entity3 fans had had enough as they chanted ' we want @entity6 out ' and they cheered ironically when @entity74 shot tamely at goal			0
they had @entity63 to thank again when he saved well from @entity50 who had burst through to run onto a @entity56 pass			0
@entity3 were fortunate not to concede a penalty as @entity136 appeared to foul @entity35 in the area as he shaped to shoot from @entity55 's pass			2
@entity22 striker @entity35 gets the job done in defence as he clears the ball from a corner with a strong header @entity3 fans appeared to lose patience with their sides run of form with some chanting ' we want [ @entity6 ] @entity6 out ' @entity3 striker @entity74 is pushed wide by @entity107 keeper @entity46 as his side is kept scoreless @entity22 's @entity48 makes a bold challenge on @entity74 sub @entity51 missed another good chance for @entity22 blazing over from more hold up play by @entity56			1
but it did not matter as @entity3 – with just 11 goals in 21 @entity24 games this term – never looked like scoring			1
there was drama late on with @entity183 sent - off for a tackle on @entity65 while @entity66 was dismissed for a second booking for his part in the ensuing melee			0
@entity52 and @entity66 appeared to clash as the players made their way towards the tunnel			2
@entity52 ' sliding tackle on @entity65 that started an ugly brawl at the close of the match referee @entity81 is perfectly placed to rule on the studs - up lunge by @entity22 's @entity52 @entity3 's @entity66 ( second right ) and @entity22 's @entity52 ( centre ) clash after @entity52 ' challenge the bench gets involved as @entity52 and @entity66 come together again after being dismissed @entity65 lays on the ground after the challenge from @entity52 , for which the @entity22 midfielder was shown a straight red card @entity66 ( second right ) was dismissed for a second booking after being cautioned for his involvement in the melee no love is lost between @entity66 and @entity52 as the @entity3 defender takes exception to his opponents tackle late in the match @entity66 ( left ) sees red after his second bookable offence following the clash with @entity52 @entity81 sends off @entity52 ( centre ) with a straight red card for the tackle on @entity65			1

@entity19 scored for @entity22 in the first minute of time added on in the first half
after being sent off in the reverse *fixture* at @entity96 on *december* 7 last year
