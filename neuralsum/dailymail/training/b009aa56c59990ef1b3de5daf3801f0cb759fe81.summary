@entity0 was plunged into a diplomatic crisis over @entity2 last night after @entity4 police fired shots at a @entity0 jet - skier in waters around the @entity8			1
in an extraordinary incident , a boat from @entity4 ’s @entity10 entered @entity13 waters and took potshots at 32 - year - old @entity15 as he rode his jet - ski close to a popular beach			1
mr @entity15 is not wanted for any particular crime and is not thought to have strayed out of @entity0 waters into @entity4 territory – although the line between the two is far from clear to people in the sea			1
he said he had confronted his @entity4 counterpart @entity38 yesterday to protest ‘ in the strongest possible terms ’			2
mr @entity34 added : ‘ i made it clear that the discharge of a weapon in or near @entity2 is completely unacceptable			2
i urged mr @entity38 to investigate urgently and to take action to ensure this will not happen again			0
’ father - of - three mr @entity15 described how he had been fired at on two separate occasions as he tested his new jet - ski with family and friends on sunday afternoon			1
‘ i was very shaken and furious , ’ said the delivery driver			2
‘ when a huge boat is hurling after you and you hear gunshots it is very scary			0
there were three policemen on the boat and i actually saw one of them with a gun in his hand			0
worrying : the jet ski rider said he had been taking friends and family members on rides when he was chased by the @entity10 vessel dramatic : this video footage shows the jet ski being chased ‘ i was just about to drop my friend off at @entity68 when i heard the first shot			1
‘ i do n’t really think we took it seriously or believed it could be a gun , but clearly it was			0
‘ i jumped back on again and whizzed off before realising the boat was chasing after me and had soon fired three more shots at me			1
‘ i had only just taken my friend ’s ten - year - old daughter out for a spin and was about to pick up her grandmother so we were not being threatening or doing anything wrong			1
the sovereignty of @entity2 is a major source of tension between the @entity0 and @entity4			1
both in 1967 and 2002 , the people of @entity2 rejected proposals for @entity4 sovereignty			2
yet , despite this , @entity4 still asserts a claim to the territory			2
the tension began in 1704 when an @entity93 - @entity92 force captured @entity2 from @entity4 during the war of the @entity4 succession			2
the territory was then ceded to @entity0 under the @entity96 in 1713			2
historically , it has proved to be an important base for the @entity99			0
now , its economy is based on tourism , financial services and shipping			0
under the 2006 constitution of @entity2 , the territory governs its own affairs although defence and foreign relations are still the responsibility of the @entity110			0
located on the southern end of the @entity113 , it is an area of 6.8 square kilometres			0
‘ maybe these guys were bored – it being a sunday – but i really hope something is going to be done about it , as it is outrageous			0
’ shots can be heard on a grainy video filmed by a witness			0
@entity0 sources said it was thought the @entity4 police fired rubber bullets at the man			1
witness @entity127 described the @entity10 as ‘ trigger - happy ’ , adding : ‘ the @entity128 has to do something now because when someone is shot in our waters then everybody will start flapping			0
’ the @entity0 ’s charge d’affaires in @entity135 was also despatched to make direct representations to ministers in the @entity4 capital			1
the incident is believed to have been witnessed by an off - duty officer from the @entity141 , which has launched a formal investigation			0
but a spokesman for @entity4 ’s @entity144 said ‘ no incident ’ had taken place ’ and ‘ no shot fired ’			1
@entity0 was given @entity2 in the @entity96 , but @entity4 has said it will never renounce its claim to sovereignty			1
@entity0 sources said @entity2 suffered frequent illegal incursions into its waters by @entity4 boats , including police and naval vessels			1
from december last year to april , officials recorded 176 illegal incursions by @entity4 boats			2
last november , @entity135 was accused of an unlawful incursion into @entity0 ’s territorial waters after a @entity4 warship called @entity161 , a 288ft corvette , came within three miles of @entity2 ’s coast			1
the ship ignored radio warnings to leave the area and @entity167 , a seven - man patrol boat , was scrambled to intercept			0
@entity2 chief minister @entity168 described the incident as a ‘ scandalous act of aggression which is illegal , imprudent , unprofessional and irresponsible ’			0
shooting : this map shows how the incident unfolded action : following the shooting , a @entity175 similar to this intercepted the @entity177 and told it to leave the waters incident : the @entity181 boat which the shots were fired from is similar to this @entity10 boat in a joint statement , @entity186 meps @entity184 , @entity187 and @entity188 – who represent @entity2 in the @entity189 – said @entity4 provocation was ‘ a form of international political posturing by a struggling government which hopes to distract attention from its domestic failures ’			1
they added : ‘ for a shot to be fired will push to a new level the offence caused to the people of @entity2			0
' this action is wholly illegal and as provocative as it is reckless			0
