the next mrs @entity0 says she ’s nifty with a knife , as her future husband , being a @entity4 - starred chef , has taught her			1
she goes to show me and i think : ‘ oh yawn , she ’s going to chop carrots			1
’ but no ! it turns out to be much more thrilling			1
she ’s talking about throwing knives , not dicing veg with them			1
‘ i ’m quite good now , ’ says @entity13 , a 39 - year - old brunette who hails from @entity14 but is currently in the @entity15 , planning her wedding in a castle			1
it started when he was chopping one day and threw the knife down on a board			1
he showed me how , and i got quite into it , to the point where we even put targets on a barn door at home for practice			1
‘ he has a portrait of himself in the kitchen and once i tried to hit it			1
bingo ! i took a chunk out of his face			1
who knew kitchen skills were so transferable ? if the bottom falls out of the food industry , they could become a circus act			1
still , being able to inflict such damage is arguably useful when you ’re set to marry a man famed for his way with the ladies			1
having read the newspaper cuttings as i travelled to meet the happy couple , though , i can see the attraction in taking a sharp implement to mr @entity58 : for as well as apparently being the sexiest chef on the planet , he might also qualify as the most sexist			1
this , after all , was the man who said of @entity63 : ‘ from the back , she looks 60			1
’ his explanation for this is little more than him gazing at me with puppy - dog eyes ( at 53 , he ’s filled out a bit since @entity71 but the swoon - factor is still great ) , and saying he was caught out with a ‘ silly little interview ’			1
@entity13 , 39 , met @entity0 in an airport where she was doing promotional work and he was catching a flight ‘ i was a prat and i should have been in control of that , but it was a ridiculous thing			1
’ so , is he sexist ? he looks appalled and says he is hurt i could think that			1
he ca n’t possibly be sexist because ‘ it ’s as bad as being racist ’			1
he says he has lots of friends who are women			2
@entity86 hugged him the other day			2
‘ and the tv chef @entity87 is one of my best friends			1
i gave her her first job — would i have done that if i was sexist ? ’ his fiancee , being from @entity14 rather than @entity91 , has a less romantic approach			1
‘ he can be such an * * * * hole , ’ says @entity13			1
‘ i did go mad with him			2
it was an outrageous thing to say			2
he was furious with @entity63 because she said she preferred @entity98 food to @entity100 food			1
‘ no other @entity100 chef reacted like he did			1
@entity102 did n’t go off on one			2
but @entity21 did — and in the most awful way			2
i said to him , “ you have n’t just insulted @entity63 but every woman on the planet			1
my sister , my mum			2
” ’ but he is n’t sexist ? ‘ no ! he just says things without thinking			2
things he does n’t even mean ! ’ hmm			2
@entity0 also tends to say things that are n’t quite true			1
like they ’d marry in @entity111 , where they first met eight years ago ( she was doing promotional work ; he was catching a plane )			2
‘ oh that ’s @entity21 making up stories , ’ she says			2
‘ he does like to tell people things they want to hear			2
’ although the pair have a home in @entity122 — where his cookery school is — they spend summers at their second home , an hour outside @entity127			2
despite getting engaged seven years ago and raising a young family , the romance is still alive for the couple everything about them is dramatic — outwardly at least			2
he was part of that wave of chefs who became as famous as rock stars ; their @entity4 stars as shiny as gold discs			2
at the height of his fame , he was appearing on tv , bringing out books , running a string of restaurants and endorsing products			1
voted the world ’s sexiest chef , he could do no wrong			1
then , in 1999 he went bankrupt			2
friend @entity150 appeared brandishing a cheque book			2
‘ i told him to f * * * off , ’ he says			1
‘ i was too proud to take his money			2
he said , “ @entity21 , do not be a prat			1
tell me how much ”			2
’ his private life has been a rollercoaster , too			2
hearing his fiancee describe it is quite an eye - opener			1
he no longer sees his first wife , @entity162 , who he met when he was just 22 , despite having an adult daughter , @entity163 , together			1
@entity13 says she was n't put off by her @entity100 fiance 's reputation as a womaniser their split , after she cheated on him , was acrimonious			1
‘ he was never at home , ’ explains @entity13			1
you can see how that would n’t work			2
’ his second marriage , in 1999 to @entity176 model @entity174 , ended in divorce in 2005			0
‘ they should n’t have married			0
’ many women would run a mile from getting involved with someone with such a colourful past			0
and , to be fair , they are not in a rush to make the union official			0
they got engaged seven years ago , and since then have had two sons — @entity21 , six , and @entity186 , two			0
she says her friends groan and go ‘ not again ’ when she tells them they have a date : august 2016			0
2016 ? ! ‘ there ’s no rush , ’ she says			0
‘ i feel we ’ve been married from the first moment we set eyes on each other			0
’ when they first met , @entity13 was determined not to be another notch on his bedpost			1
she took a job at his cookery school , but resolved to keep their relationship professional			0
‘ i thought he was incredibly handsome , and i could easily fall for him — but i was n’t going to			0
i remember saying “ do n’t look into his eyes , @entity13 ”			1
for six months , i did n’t			0
’ what was she afraid of ? ‘ he had a reputation			0
he was @entity100 , famous , you know			0
’ yet he was smitten			0
within six months , he ’d seduced her			0
he took her to dinner with his friend , the late chef @entity214			1
she knew she was in love with him when she saw him dancing in a club afterwards — badly			0
‘ i was already on the dance floor — and this manic figure came towards me , all arms and legs flying			0
he dances like he does everything else — throws himself in			0
’ @entity13 ’s very pretty , with astonishing eyes , but regards herself as ‘ nothing special ’			1
it took a while for her to trust him			0
‘ oh yes , at the start i went through his phone messages , thinking i was going to catch him out , but i did n’t			0
then i realised “ he means this ”			0
he wants a family life			0
’ what about the female attention he attracts , though ? they can be blatant , she says , slipping numbers into his jacket pocket			0
she stands up and thrusts her chest out , to demonstrate what women do in front of him			0
how does he deal with it ? ‘ he ’s very good at repelling it , ’ she says			0
‘ he ’s the most loyal person i know			0
’ he is n’t at all aware of his looks , she says			0
@entity21 gets all @entity100 when i ask him about fidelity			0
‘ it is the most important thing			0
if someone is unfaithful at home , you must question everything about them			0
’ despite admitting to booze - fuelled rows , the couple have settled into domestic bliss did he and his big mate @entity260 ever discuss fidelity ( @entity260 being another of the culinary world ’s supposed bad boys ) ? he looks shocked			0
‘ @entity260 was never unfaithful			0
i know this for a fact			0
he ’s a remarkable man			0
’ what ’s interesting is how many parallels there were , in the early days at least , between @entity21 and @entity13 ’s fiery relationship and the one between @entity260 and his ( now estranged ) wife @entity270			1
@entity13 says they had their fair share of huge , often booze - fuelled rows , where petty jealousies and insecurities came to the fore			1
‘ about two years ago , we actually changed the way we were doing things because we were drinking too much , and rowing through the drink			0
i ’d accuse him of flirting with other women			0
he ’d do the same			0
’ although he still appears on tv , @entity21 ’s main job is now the cookery school			1
neither seem to miss the restaurants			0
‘ not having them — and the hours that go with them — means we have a chance of a family life , ’ says @entity13			1
he must miss the @entity4 stars , though ? ‘ i am still a @entity4 - starred chef , ’ he says			1
‘ i always will be			0
’ what about @entity13 ? it now seems almost de rigeur for tv chef @entity299 to launch their own career ( @entity303 ’s clothing range , @entity305 ’s cookery book )			1
it seems we should n’t hold our breath for the latter			0
‘ oh @entity311 no , i ’m a hopeless cook , ’ she says			0
‘ she could , though , write the definite book on how to tame a man			0
@entity314 knives optional , obviously .			0

@entity13 , 39 , will become @entity0 's third wife
the tv chef *publicly* insulted @entity63 , saying in an interview looks ' from the back , she looks 60 '
@entity0 admits he was a ' prat ' while fiancee says he can be an ' * * * hole '
@entity327 , by @entity0 ( @entity326 ) , is out now .
