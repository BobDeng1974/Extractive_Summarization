in a world first , phone maker @entity0 has confirmed it will start selling flexible screens for smartphones and tablets - and they could be launched as early as next month			1
the 6 - inch display will be made of bendy plastic substrates , rather than glass , and the panel can be attached to any curved device			1

the 6 - inch display , pictured , will be made of bendy plastic substrates , rather than glass , and the panel can be attached to any curved device @entity11 , the @entity13 firm 's research arm , has additionally said it is ready to unveil its curved battery prototype			1
the team has been testing its ' cable battery ' , pictured , on lcd screens and it is so bendy it can be tied in knots @entity11 used thin strands of copper wire , coated with nickel - tin , which are then spun into a ' metal yarn ' and wrapped around a rod			2
the rod is then removed , leaving a strong spring which can be tucked into tight and small spaces			0
the team said : ' in our experiments we found that our prototype was exceptionally ﬂexible and could suffer large strain without malfunction			0
' they added that , when designing new devices , ' the limiting factor is often the shape of the battery ' and that their battery could be ' a disruptive technology that could open up a path for design innovation			0
' although rival @entity54 similarly announced plans to launch its own flexible display last month , @entity0 is expected to beat the company to making the technology available to consumers			2
the @entity17 phone is rumoured to launch next month			1
although the handset is n't expected to be bendy , the use of a flexible screen could mean it has a more curved display than current phones			1
@entity54 's @entity68 and @entity69 phones have slightly curved , oled screens , but they both use curved glass , not flexible plastic			2
however , the first truly curved devices may not be available to customers until next year			0
' @entity75 is launching a new era of flexible displays for smartphones with its industry - leading technology , ' said dr. @entity81 , executive vice president and chief technology officer of @entity75			0

although the handset is n't expected to be bendy , the use of the screen , pictured , could mean it has a more curved display than current phones the design is made of 0.44mm - thin plastic and has a protective film attached to the back , making it ' bendable and unbreakable			1
' it is vertically concave from top to bottom , has a radius of 7cm and weighs 7.2g			0
@entity75 's technology could also be fitted to smart watches , and other devices , that can be wrapped around items , pictured @entity75 claims the flexible oled panel is the ' world 's slimmest among existing mobile device panels			1
' the company 's new battery technology could also revolutionise smartphones because it is so bendy it can be tied in knots			2
this means it can be shaped around other components			0
it could even improve the battery life of phones because manufacturers could add more power into the batteries , if they 're not restricted by size or shape			0
@entity11 's cable - type lithium - ion battery can even woven into textiles			2
this means the technology could also be fitted to clothes , and users could end up ' wearing ' phone chargers			0
both @entity0 and @entity54 have already produced curved 55 - inch oled tvs on sale for around £ 8,500			1
it is unsure how much the 6 - inch display or the @entity17 phone will cost , but the technology is expected to come at a premium			1

@entity148 's prototype screen was so flexible it could be rolled around a pencil both @entity0 and @entity54 have already produced curved 55 - inch oled tvs on sale for around £ 8,500			1
@entity154 's ( organic light - emitting diodes ) are used to create digital displays in tvs , computer monitors , phones , tablets and games consoles			0
an oled display works without a backlight , which means it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display ( lcd )			2
in low lighting , an @entity154 screen can produce a higher contrast ratio than an lcd , too			0
in march last year , @entity75 also developed the world 's first 6 - inch @entity171 ( @entity171 ) based on e-ink that had a plastic back panel			1
however , @entity148 was the first company to unveil flexible display technology back in 2010 , but it has not been made available to customers			0
@entity148 's prototype screen was so flexible it could be rolled around a pencil			2
rumours before @entity54 launched its @entity180 in august believed it would have with a flexible display , however , the device has a solid 2 - inch screen fitted to a traditional watch strap			1
this was said to be because technology firms have yet to figure out how to mass produce the parts cheaply and come up with display panels that can be as thin as a sheet and highly heat resistant			0
@entity191 - based @entity190 is an expert on flexible displays and has created a number of prototypes and devices , including the 10.7 - inch @entity198 tablet and the @entity199 that is set to be a thin and light flip cover for @entity201 , @entity148 and @entity54 phones			1
