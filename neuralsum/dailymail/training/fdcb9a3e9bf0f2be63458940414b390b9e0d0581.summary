@entity0 has begun new screenings for @entity3 passengers flying into @entity4 from countries being ravaged by the ebola virus			1
as many as 150 travelers per day who arrive from @entity8 , @entity9 or @entity10 will now be stopped and checked with contactless thermometers in the hope of keeping the disease out of the @entity14			1
anybody who has a fever will be interviewed to see whether they have had contact with an @entity6 sufferer , and from there can be quarantined if necessary			2
pictured is a test taking place in @entity29 , @entity30 - much closer to the outbreak high - tech : this is how the advanced thermometers will work without putting public health workers at risk roll - out : the tests will only affect some 150 passengers per day from the worst - hit countries			1
pictured above are queues at @entity0 the new scheme , which began today , will be expanded over the next week to @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity48 's @entity47			1
between them the five airports carry around 95 per cent of passengers from the countries worst afflicted by @entity6			2
no airlines fly direct to the @entity14 from the three countries			0
but @entity55 can track passengers ' routes even if they make several stops			2
announcement : @entity60 , commissioner of the @entity61 , explains the new screenings to be implemented at @entity0 and other airports quarantine : authorities across the country have been making ready for @entity6			1

president @entity78 said wednesday that the new screening measures are ' really just belt and suspenders ' to support protections already in place			0
first @entity14 victim : @entity85 , a @entity8 who flew to @entity87 , died of @entity6 this week @entity89 agents already look for people who are obviously ill , as do flight crews			2
passengers are also screened for the virus when they leave @entity3			0
public health workers are expecting some false alarms from travelers who have a high temperature from other illnesses			1
@entity6 is n't contagious until symptoms begin , and it spreads through direct contact with the bodily fluids of patients			0
however , even these measures are not a foolproof block on the disease			0
the extra screening would n't have identified @entity85 when he arrived from @entity8 last month - because he had no symptoms while traveling			1
@entity85 was the first person to be diagnosed with @entity6 in the @entity14			0
he died on wednesday in @entity108 , @entity87 .			0
