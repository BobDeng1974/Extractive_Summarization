more than 400 migrants were stopped from getting into @entity1 from @entity2 this weekend as they used end - of - summer traffic jams to climb on board vehicles queueing for ferries to @entity6			1
police found 300 stowaways in 69 trucks on saturday alone , forcing them to divert freight traffic along a ‘ secure route ’ accompanied by riot squads			0
the number of migrants found hidden in vehicles in @entity2 in 2014 is expected to reach 30,000			1
some 3,000 are now found every month			0
@entity26 , of the @entity27 , said : ‘ while @entity2 to @entity6 remains the preferred route for migrants trying to cross to @entity1 , our members have reported stowaways trying to get into their vehicles at ports such as @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
’ @entity39 , of @entity41 haulage firm @entity42 , said : ‘ we see more and more migrants in western @entity41 , in ports in @entity45 and @entity46			1
’ the @entity41 government will today be urged to approve plans for a ‘ @entity53 - style ’ camp outside @entity2 and a series of ‘ welcome centres ’ for @entity1 - bound migrants across @entity41			1
@entity2 mayor @entity54 will tell interior minister @entity55 that providing shelter , food and information on asylum to migrants determined to reach the @entity1 is the only way to take back control of her town			1
but the proposed camp has been likened to the notorious @entity65 at @entity53 that was used by 60,000 as a springboard for illegal entry to @entity1 before it was closed in 2002			2
mrs @entity54 blames @entity1 ’s generous welfare and asylum systems for attracting a stream of migrants from @entity72 , @entity73 and the @entity74 which have brought havoc to the streets of @entity2			1
action : the @entity41 government will be urged to approve plans for a ' @entity53 - style ' camp to curb the figures the influx dramatically increased earlier this year when the crisis in @entity83 allowed migrants from @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 to reach @entity42 from the @entity89 coast			2
@entity41 authorities are struggling to maintain order with up to 2,000 living in makeshift camps and squats in and around the town			0
the number could reach up to 5,000 by the end of the year , politicians fear			2
armed gangs fight pitched battles for control of the best vantage point from which to break into trucks boarding ferries to @entity6			0
riot police are expected to launch a fresh assault on the biggest encampment , known as @entity108 , in the coming days			0
but local leaders say a crackdown will not end the problem			0
under the mayor ’s proposals a summer camp for children close to the ferry port will be transformed into a hostel for 400 , providing regular meals and washing facilities			0
mrs @entity54 has urged the leaders of other towns and villages where migrants have congregated to set up ‘ welcome centres ’ which will not provide accommodation but will offer advice on their rights			0
and she will also ask for a change in the law to allow migrants to make applications for asylum in @entity1 while still in @entity41 .			2

number of hidden migrants crossing into @entity1 set to reach 30,000 this year
situation has led to haulage firms advising drivers to bypass @entity2
it means stowaways are now targeting other ports with lower security
