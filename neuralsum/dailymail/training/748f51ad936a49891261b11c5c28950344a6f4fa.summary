he 's on the three - man shortlist for this year 's @entity2 but @entity3 did n't quite end his stellar year as planned on friday night			1
the 28 - year - old has made a lot of strikers look foolish with his impressive outfield ball skills , but this time the @entity9 goalkeeper got a taste of his own medicine as the @entity13 giants travelled to @entity14			0
@entity3 was made to look rather foolish for the hosts opener on 21 minutes as @entity17 's left - footed shot at the near post rather embarrassingly nutmegged him			1
video : @entity21 's reaction after getting nutmegged for @entity17 's opener @entity17 hits the ball through the legs of @entity3 in @entity14 's 2 - 1 loss to @entity9 @entity3 starts to fall over after being taken aback by the low driven strike from @entity17 the ballon d'or nominee fails to hold his balance as the ball crashes the back of the net @entity3 hits the deck as @entity17 wheels away in celebration after scoring against the @entity13 international in a moment that would be more akin to a slapstick comedy , @entity3 's reaction to conceding the goal is priceless as the towering @entity13 is literally left flat - footed by @entity17 's strike and ends up falling over to the ground			1
the 34 - year - old 's goal was @entity9 's fourth conceded in 17 league games , the fewest ever in the first half of a @entity46 season			2
despite the @entity48 's effort though , @entity3 would eventually have the last laugh as strikes from team - mates @entity51 and @entity53 saw @entity55 's side turn the match on it 's head			0
@entity53 's 90th minute winner sends @entity46 leaders into the winter break with a commanding 14 - point lead			0
their eighth successive league victory also maintains the @entity65 outfit 's unbeaten run in @entity67 's top tier this season .			0

@entity9 won 2 - 1 away at @entity14 in friday 's @entity46 clash
@entity17 gave the hosts the lead with a near post finish on 21 minutes
@entity17 's strike nutmegged @entity3 and the keeper fell over
