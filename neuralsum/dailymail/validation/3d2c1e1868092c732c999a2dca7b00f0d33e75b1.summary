@entity2 said in his @entity11 address that @entity13 ' advance had been stopped , @entity0 said			2
' that is simply not true			0
' ' he says @entity13 is not a religious movement			0

' to deny the fundamental religious nature of the threat and downplay the seriousness of it is naive , it 's dangerous , and it 's misguided , ' @entity0 , a self - described ' wannabe ' presidential candidate said at a @entity26 's @entity26 event this morning			1

we did n't choose it , but we need to have the will to finish it			0
' @entity0 was the guest speaker at the @entity55 , @entity10 , breakfast for major presidential hopefuls that the historic college lauds as a ' must - stop ' event on the campaign trail			1
other maybe - presidential candidates who have headlined the event in the ' @entity61 in the @entity63 ' state so far this year are former @entity65 ceo @entity64 , former @entity67 ambassador @entity66 , @entity69 sen. @entity68 and @entity71 sen. @entity70 , whose appearance came earlier this week on monday			1
famed in presidential politics as the second state to hold a presidential contest every four years and the first one to hold a primary - @entity34 , the first state to vote , holds a caucus - @entity10 is a popular destination for would - be contestants for the @entity80			2
the speech was an opportunity for @entity0 to flex his muscles and explain why he 'd make a better commander in chief than close to a dozen other @entity85 flirting with national campaigns			2
but at the end of the event , possibly unaware that his mic was still hot , the @entity1 @entity85 revealed that he was being coached on foreign policy by his friend - and likely presidential candidate - @entity70			1
asked to sign what appeared from a distance to be a program of this political season 's @entity26 speakers , @entity0 announced that he would sign his name next to @entity70			1
' @entity70 's my buddy			1
i am a big @entity70 fan , ' @entity0 disclosed			1
' i think he 's one of the most knowledgeable people that we have on foreign policy , and we , we need to listen to him			2
he is a very , very bright @entity104 senator , who is ...			0
you know he 's carved out his niche , and it is foreign policy			2
' @entity108 , @entity0 said , ' i talked to him night before last , just ... picking his brain a little bit about what 's going on in @entity112 , in particular ... [ @entity115 president @entity114 ] @entity113 is , is a dangerous guy			1
' and this strategy of kind of strategic patience with him , i do n't think is wise , ' @entity0 added , still talking about @entity113			0
senator @entity70 of @entity71 speaks to reporters at the @entity121 on tuesday			2
@entity0 , possibly unaware that he was still being recorded , admitted today that the @entity123 member - who is plotting his own presidential bid - is advising him on foreign policy @entity2 said in a december interview with @entity127 that he 'd learned throughout his nearly six years in office the value of ' having some strategic patience ' when it comes to @entity115			1
' you ’ll recall that three or four months ago , everybody in @entity134 was convinced that president @entity113 was a genius and he had out maneuvered all of us , ' @entity2 stated			0
' i said at the time we do n’t want war with @entity115 but we can apply steady pressure ... being the backbone of an international coalition to oppose @entity115 ’s violation of another country ’s sovereignty , and that over time this would be a strategic mistake by @entity115			0
' and today , you know , i ’d sense that at least outside of @entity115 , maybe some people are thinking what @entity113 did was n’t so smart , ' the @entity104 president proclaimed			0
@entity0 , still miked up , said he does n't ascribe to the @entity2 administration 's theory that the slump in oil prices and economic downturn in @entity115 will crack @entity113			2
' you got ta remember the ' 90s and how bad it got in @entity115 , ' @entity0 told an admirer			0
' it 's not anywhere near as bad as that now			0
' @entity0 asserted that @entity113 has ' like $ 386 billion of reserves ' of oil and gas money that he put aside			0
' it 's actually a lot better now , and so , trying to wait him out is not a good strategy , ' he said			0
spelling out how he 'd handle @entity115 's aggression , @entity0 said , ' i think you have to fund the lethal weapons to the @entity112 military			1
' ' you take the @entity175 banking ability from him , ' he said , referring to the @entity176 , and international banking system , and ' go after the 1,000 people or so that actually run @entity115 and have all the money ' - the oligarchs			0
then , @entity0 said he 'd ' flood @entity182 with liquifed national gas			0
' ' and that would really bring him to his knees			0
' keynote speaker of a monday politics and @entity189 program , @entity70 signs wooden eggs for guests at the political speech series in @entity55 , @entity10 a spokesman for @entity0 did not immediately return the @entity195 's request for clarification on whether the former @entity1 governor and 2008 presidential candidate knew he was still being broadcast when he made the remarks about @entity70 and @entity113			1
@entity70 , a defense hawk and member of the @entity123 who is building his presidential bid around his foreign policy credentials , has also been critical of @entity2 's ' strategic patience ' claims			1
' i doubt @entity13 , the @entity208 mullahs , or @entity113 will be intimidated by president @entity2 's strategy of " strategic patience , " ' @entity70 said last month in response to @entity2 's announcement that the mantra would drive his national security strategy moving forward			1
' from their point of view , the more " patience " president @entity2 practices the stronger they become , ' he said in a statement			2
' the @entity222 , or " strategic patience , " has led to a world in chaos			0
' ' applying more " patience " to president @entity2 's failed foreign policy just prolongs failure			1
