the @entity1 plane that crashed into the @entity2 last month climbed faster than ' normal speed ' and stalled , @entity4 's @entity3 has revealed			1
all 162 people on board flight @entity7 are thought to have died when it crashed during a short trip from @entity11 to @entity12			1
at an earlier parliamentary hearing , @entity13 said radar data showed the @entity16 was climbing at a rate of 6,000ft ( 1,800m ) a minute before the crash			1
he added : ' i think it is rare even for a fighter jet to be able to climb 6,000ft per minute			1
' for a commercial flight , climbing around 1,000 to 2,000 ( feet ) is maybe already considered extraordinary , because it is not meant to climb that fast			2
' stalled : @entity4 's @entity25 said flight @entity7 was climbing abnormally fast before it stalled unusual : citing radar data , @entity28 revealed it was climbing at 6,000ft per minute - which is ' rare even for a fighter jet ' , he said conclusive : as a police officer guards part of the fuselage of the jet , investigators are analysing the flight data recorder , which monitors every major part of the plane to determine what caused the crash lost : all but seven of those on board the routine flight from @entity11 to @entity12 were @entity4 tragedy : the @entity1 jet crashed into the @entity2 last month with 162 people on board , who are all thought to have died investigation : judging from the plane 's voice recorder , investigators ruled out the possibility that terrorists were to blame for the crash the country 's meteorological agency thought bad weather may have caused the tragedy , and investigators are still studying the plane 's black box before releasing an official report			1
but it 's emerged the pilot asked for permission to climb to a higher altitude to avoid the storm , moments before the plane disappeared from radar			2
his request was not granted due to ' heavy air traffic '			0
the transport minister added : ' in the final minutes , the plane climbed at a speed which was beyond normal			2
' the plane suddenly went up at a speed above the normal limit that it was able to climb to			0
' this latest revelation comes as @entity4 investigators focused on the possibility of human error , or mechanical problems with the plane having caused the crash - following an initial analysis of the cockpit voice recorder			0
terrorism had already been ruled out according to investigator @entity92 , who said : ' we did n't hear any other person , no explosion			0
' as well as the cockpit voice recorder , the committee is also examining a wealth of information in the flight data recorder , which monitors every major part of the plane			2
a preliminary report will be releasd on january 28			1
mourning : rescuers have only been able to recover 53 bodies from the plane , after a massive international search helped to discover the crash sites confusion : moments before the plane disappeared from radar , the pilot 's request to climb to a higher altitude to avoid a storm was denied discovery : last week , a @entity12 navy ship located the jet 's main body , with the @entity1 motto ' now everyone can fly ' painted on the side unsuccessful recovery : divers have failed to reach the fuselage , despite several attempts due to bad weather ships from several different countries , including the @entity130 and @entity131 , were involved in a huge international hunt for the crashed plane			1
@entity4 search and rescue teams have so far recovered just 53 bodies from the sea			1
but last week , a @entity12 navy ship located the jet 's main body - with the @entity1 motto ' now everyone can fly ' painted on the side			0
rescue teams hope they will be able to find many of the passengers and crew inside			0
divers have so far failed to reach the fuselage despite several attempts due to bad weather , high waves and strong underwater currents			0
all but seven of those on board the flight were @entity4			0
the foreign nationals were from @entity156 , @entity12 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 .			0

radar data shows plane climbed at 6,000ft per minute before disappearing
' rare for a fighter jet ' to be able to climb that fast , said @entity3
investigators will release preliminary report of all findings on january 28
