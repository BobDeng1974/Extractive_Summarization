by @entity0 last updated at 9:03 pm on 9th november 2011 at 11.11.11 on 11.11.11 the time and date will be a perfect same - numbered palindrome , reading the same backwards as forwards - an event which can only happen on one day every 100 years			1
but for @entity6 and @entity7 , 11.11.11 is an even more special day - their 11th birthday			1
the twins , from @entity11 , @entity12 , have already received their present from an aunt – a bag containing 11 bags , each containing 11 little presents			0
special day : @entity6 and @entity7 will celebrate their 11th birthday on friday , the 11th november , 2011 ‘ if we go to school , we 'll stay for 11 minutes , ’ @entity6 told the @entity20			1
‘ or they may count down on the school clock to 11 minutes after 11 , ’ @entity7 suggested			0
spoon - bending ' psychic ' @entity25 believes that thanks to its status as a ' balanced ' number , ' 11.11 is the pre-encoded trigger and key to the mysteries of the universe and beyond ' the twins , born 17 minutes apart on saturday , nov. 11 , 2000 , have been deemed the ' child messiah ' by @entity37 , which recognizes 11.11.11 as the date that most closely resembles the material			1
but friday 's date will also hold meaning for many others			2
it will be : the reason the date is so unusual is that 11.11.11 is the only double - figure palindromic date , since there is no 22nd month			2
and the last time it happened , on november 11 1911 , an almost supernatural event saw temperatures drop by more than @entity50 in a single day			1
this was the @entity52 , a cold snap which hit the @entity54 causing blizzards and tornadoes as well as record falls in temperature			0
in @entity60 , it was as warm as @entity62 ( @entity61 ) in the morning - but this had dropped to @entity64 ( -12c ) by the end of the day			0
a new film being released on friday , entitled simply 11 - 11 - 11 , predicts that the day will see the opening of a portal in to @entity69 , and says : ' on this day , innocent blood will spill			1
' remembrance : november 11 is best known in the @entity72 as @entity73 , or @entity74 in the @entity54 the film by @entity76 , director of several entries in the saw franchise , features a man whose family dies in a car crash at 11.11am , and who then begins to be haunted by the number 11			1
it plays on beliefs long held by some spiritualists , who say that the number has a special significance and claim that many people have a mystical attraction to the time 11.11			1
one group believes that 11.11 is the special symbol of the ' @entity93 ' , a group of 1,111 celestial beings who supposedly look after mortals and manifest themselves in mid-morning			0
spoon - bending ' psychic ' @entity25 has written that the number represents ' the need to find balance in life ' , and added : ' when i see the number 1111 , i pray for sick children and world peace			2
' horror : this friday sees the release of apocalyptic film 11 - 11 - 11 , which predicts the opening of a hellmouth he also believes that thanks to its status as a ' balanced ' number , ' 11.11 is the pre-encoded trigger and the key to the mysteries of the universe and beyond '			1
however , most of those who have chosen this friday as a day to get married are more attracted by the pleasing coincidence than by any deeper significance			1
@entity124 : the romantic town in the @entity126 will have an upswing in marriages on 11.11.11 the small town of @entity124 , a traditional wedding venue near the border between @entity132 and @entity133 , will host at least 50 weddings on 11.11.11 , compared to fewer than a dozen on a typical november friday			2
wedding mania will be even more pronounced overseas , such as in @entity137 where thousands of couples have judged the date to be auspicious for a successful marriage			0
@entity141 , a @entity142 journalist who is getting married in @entity143 on friday , said that it ' means a lot to be able to get married on such a historical date			2
' she added : ' we chose 11.11.11 for our wedding day because it 's a date which nobody , including my rather absent - minded fiancé , will ever forget			1
' like @entity6 and @entity7 , the day will also be one of celebration for a number of children who will be turning 11 on 11.11.11			1
trousers : one group which is taking the day in its correct spirit is the @entity37 , which has anointed 11.11.11 as ' @entity160 ' because it is made up of straight lines for @entity162 , of @entity163 in @entity164 , @entity133 it will be even more special , as she sees in her 11th birthday at her house - number 11			1
most famously , the 11th of november is @entity73 in the @entity72 - @entity74 in the @entity54 - when we celebrate the end of @entity169 and commemorate the victims of that war and subsequent ones			2
the reason we ascribe significance to 11.11.11 is apophenia - the urge to find patterns in seemingly random data			2
it is this that explains why we see clouds forming certain shapes , and why we often hear of people finding ' faces ' in things like potato crisps			0
@entity187 is also important in the psychology of gamblers			0
it can either encourage those on a winning streak to believe that it will continue , or convince losing gamblers that their luck must inevitably change			0
while it can be a symptom of mental illness if taken to an extreme - as depicted in the film a beautiful mind - apophenia is instinctive to all humans as a way of drawing conclusions about the world			0
this phenomenon helps us , for example , to recognise abstract drawings as representing human figures , and to remember phone numbers which seem to follow a pattern			0
the end of the @entity169 came on november 11 , 1918			0
given the carnage seen in the war , we can assume that the date was not deliberately chosen , but was simply the earliest possible opportunity for a ceasefire			0
however , the decision to end the war at exactly 11 o'clock certainly was deliberate , at the @entity220 was signed around five in the morning ( @entity221 time ) , to take effect at the symbolic point a few hours later			2
tragically , fierce fighting continued right up until the official ceasefire , and one @entity54 soldier was killed at 10.58			0
of course , there is no real significance to the date 11.11.11 - not even at the time of 11.11.11 - but it is a classic example of apophenia , the human urge to see patterns in essentially random events			1
with that in mind , perhaps the group which is taking the day in its correct spirit is the @entity37 , which has anointed 11.11.11 as ' @entity160 ' because it is made up of straight lines			0
however , to say that the date is no more than a coincidence would have provided little comfort to those who endured the bizarre weather on the last 11.11.11			0
it remains to be seen whether 11.11.11 will produce such surprises this time around , but people should be sure to keep a careful eye on the weather - and on any local @entity249 - at 11 seconds past 11 minutes past 11 o'clock .			1

date and time will hit 11.11.11 11.11.11 on friday
only occurs on one day every 100 years
@entity73 , celebrated around the world .
a day of spiritual significance for those who believe the number 11 has a mystical power .
perhaps even the @entity261 , according to some ' *prophecy* ' *web* forums .
