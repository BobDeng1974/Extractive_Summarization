' monday looking at a low pressure trough bringing showers and storms in afternoon and evening but it will still be quite warm			0
' but the heat stretched far and wide to @entity4 , the @entity166 and @entity167 although it skipped @entity168			0
@entity170 hovered just below it 's forecast top of 35 degrees at around four oc'lock , @entity169 surpassed it 's top to reach 39 degrees and a usually mild @entity176 also surprisingly reached its expected top of 38 degrees			2
