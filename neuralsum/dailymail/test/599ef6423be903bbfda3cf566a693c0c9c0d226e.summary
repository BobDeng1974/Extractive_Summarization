made famous by their ' matchy matchy ' style and twin - like looks , the @entity1 based fashion duo @entity3 , 22 , and @entity4 , 27 , @entity2 are now set to take their crazy style collaborations to a new level			2
the sisters have teamed up with ' @entity15 ' - an innovative online @entity17 - based company that allows you to digitally design your own prints - and @entity21 shoes , the brand behind the @entity13 ' trademark platforms			1
introduced to the company via a mutual friend in the @entity25 , the girls knew it was a match made in heaven			1
' we both have a love of colour and prints and so we said lets do something crazy together , ' says @entity4			1
while the duo look posed and polished in the pics , they let us in on a little secret , according to the ' how two @entity58 ' girls , they insist they do n't actually like modelling , despite the 1732 posts on @entity61 that would suggest otherwise			1
' we do n’t like to model , so we decided to add wigs and sunnies so we can hide behind them and they do n’t see us , ' says @entity3			2
candy coloured palettes : @entity4 , 27 ( left ) and @entity3 , 22 ( right ) @entity67 have over 111,000 followers on @entity61 @entity69 says they use the term ' modelling ' loosely as they do n't see themselves as professional models , they just happen to be in the photos showcasing the clothes			1
the photo shoot which took place in @entity81 's @entity80 provided the perfect backdrop for the crazy , clown - like antics of the collaboration			1
' they closed the park for the day so we had a couple of hours to take over and shoot			2
it provided the perfect creepy abandoned backdrop			2
' model shy : the girls admit while they love wearing clothes , they are actually camera shy theme this : @entity81 's theme park ' @entity80 ' was the backdrop for their crazy colour pop collaboration the shoes featured are also as part of the collaboration and are from the brand ' @entity104 ' which are the same brand who sky - rocketed platforms into the mainstream when they were famously worn by the @entity13 during the 90s			1
' we 'd been collaborating with the guys from @entity21 shoes but we were n't sure what our following would think , so we posted a pic on @entity61 and everyone has been dying over them - so it 's had a great response , ' says @entity3			1
while the photo shoot for their current collaboration only took a quick 45 minutes , the @entity2 sisters had a lot of other projects keeping them busy			1
down - to - earth duo : 45 minutes is all it took to string together the glamour shots as seen throughout pop princesses : the platforms made by @entity104 are the same company made famous by the @entity13 first there 's their new shoe label , titled ' @entity132 , ' coming out in june in @entity25			1
' we did a shoe collaboration with @entity135 a year and a half ago and once we got a taste for shoes we fell in love , ' says @entity3			1
' this first line will be all about sandals with flat and platform soles , ' she said			0
according to @entity3 , platforms are a must because they 're much more comfortable than heels - ' you ’re feet wo n't be sore at the end of the night and you still get the height			2
' flair for fashion : with a natural knack for fashion the girls are now releasing a ' how - to ' book titled @entity152 colour craziness : ' how to live ' have become well known thanks to their colourful @entity156 style questioned why @entity25 is their first market , the sisters admit escaping to summer weather is their biggest appeal , especially as their based most of the year in @entity1 ( known for it 's southerly chill )			1
' we ’re going to go for three months then decide if we 'll stay on permanently			0
we love @entity39 , and we already have a fan base and connections to the shoe industry over there so it just made sense , ' says @entity4			2
they also have a book in the works , with the very insta - worthy title ' # howtwolive ' coming out in september			0
celebrity scene : in their short two and a half years of blogging they 've met @entity175 and @entity176 the book offers 36 ' how - two ' projects including fashion , recipes and nail art ideas			0
as for more collaborations ? there 's more on the cards but according to the girls it 's still under tight wraps at the moment			0
not that the fashion bloggers will need any help with exposure			0
the duo have met a lot of fashion royalty in the two and a half years since their blog 's conception - with highlights including @entity175 at @entity199 and @entity176 when they guest edited for @entity201			0
fame and fortune aside , at the end of the day all the girls really care about is representing fashion			0
' in the @entity156 blogging scene , everyone does the same thing , so we decided early on our goal was to bring colour into the @entity156 market , ' says @entity3			0
patriotic pair : despite business endeavours in the @entity25 they take pride in representing @entity156 designers and it 's their vibrant and uniquely @entity156 approach that seems to be working			1
' when we met @entity175 we were wearing an amazing @entity156 designer @entity221 and she came up to us and was like ‘ " i love what you ’re wearing , you girls look so crazy , " ' says @entity3			0
' it also helps that we were wearing big sunnies , very @entity175 , she adds			0
' we love to promote @entity156 designers when we 're overseas			0
when we guest edited @entity229 , it was so cool to have people from @entity231 come up and ask us who we were wearing , ' she said despite their recent success , the duo from @entity1 remain down - to - earth about their life and even admit that despite receiving the odd gifts here and there they prefer to buy all their own clothes			0
' it 's flattering to receive gifts but we 're a bit picky and it 's always better to buy what you love and stay true to what your style is , ' says @entity3 .			0
