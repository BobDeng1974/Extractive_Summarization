chatting on your phone drains its battery , but in the future , all this talk time could actually be used to boost its power			0
researchers from @entity7 have created a chin strap that harvests energy from jaw movements , including chewing and talking			1
it is hoped the device could soon be used to power electronic devices , such as hearing aids , cochlear implants , and even phones			0
the chin strap , ( setup pictured ) is made from a smart piezoelectric material known as @entity20 , which consists of integrated electrodes and adhesive polymer			1
it produces an electric charge when it stretches , and is subjected to mechanical stress the strap is made from a smart material known as @entity20			1
@entity20 is a type of piezoelectric material made up of integrated electrodes , and an adhesive polymer matrix			1

to ensure maximum performance , the chin strap was fitted snugly to the user , so when the user ’s jaw moved it caused the strap to stretch			2
to test the performance of the device , the subject was asked to chew gum for 60 seconds while wearing the head - mounted device			0
the maximum amount of power that could be harvested from the jaw movements was around 18 microwatts , but researchers claim that a realistic output is closer to 10 microwatts			1
this is still just a fraction of the energy used in a typical phone charger , which uses between 10 and 16 watts per day - but the strap is still in an experimental phase			0
in their study , researchers from @entity64 in @entity65 ( @entity66 ) in @entity67 , @entity7 , created an energy harvesting strap made from a single layer of @entity20 and attached it to a pair of ear muffs using a pair of elastic side straps			1

the first results of the device ’s performance have been published in @entity94 ’s journal @entity95			0
jaw movements proved to be one of the most promising candidates for generating electricity from human body movements , with researchers estimating that an average of around seven microwatts of power could be generated from chewing during meals alone			0
co-author of the study @entity107 said : ‘ given that the average power available from chewing is around seven microwatts , we still have a long way to go before we perfect the performance of the device			0

the maximum amount of power harvested from the chin strap ( pictured ) was 18 microwatts , but researchers are working on increasing this output significantly ‘ the power level we achieved is hardly sufficient for powering electrical devices at the moment ; however , we can multiply the power output by adding more @entity20 layers to the chin strap			1
' for example , 20 @entity20 layers , with a total thickness of 6mm , would be able to power a 200 microwatts intelligent hearing protector			2
' the only expensive part of the energy harvesting device is the single @entity20 layer , which costs around $ 20 ( £ 12 )			0
‘ considering the price and short lifetime of batteries , we estimate that a self - powered hearing protector based on the proposed chin strap energy harvesting device will start to pay back the investment after three years of use , ’ continued @entity107			0
‘ additionally , the device could substantially decrease the environmental impact of batteries and bring more comfort to users			0
‘ we will now look at ways to increase the number of piezoelectric elements in the chin strap to supply the power that small electronic devices demand , and also develop an appropriate power management circuit so that a tiny , rechargeable battery can be integrated into the device			2
