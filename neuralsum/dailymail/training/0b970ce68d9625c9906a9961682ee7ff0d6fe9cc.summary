diligence : @entity9 dispatcher @entity8 stayed on the phone with a stroke victim for 8 hours as emergency workers searched desperately for her using information from the cell phone tower that had routed the call from the victim , @entity23 , the medics first rushed to an @entity27 71st street @entity26 address according to the @entity28			1
but @entity29 was n’t there			2
still on the phone with @entity29 , @entity32 continued speaking to @entity29 and trying to get as much information about her location as possible			0
‘ throughout the entirety , she worked to keep the patient awake , she never lost her own composure and remained calm while attempting to elicit more information from the patient , ’ wrote @entity37 capt. @entity36 @entity44 in a letter recommending to the @entity9 that @entity32 be given recognition for her valiant efforts			1
desperate : the @entity9 , fire marshal , and @entity50 all searched for victim @entity23 on monday			1
@entity51 was finall able to pinpoint her location using her cell phone before any of that could happen , however , the ailing @entity29 needed to be found			0
@entity32 ’s boss , lt. @entity56 , enlisted the @entity58 ’s office for help			0
together they searched patient databases and for people who shared @entity29 ’s name			0
though that search would prove futile because , as it turned out , @entity29 was n’t calling from her home			2
the @entity50 threw their hat in the ring as well , as did @entity70 , in an effort to precisely pinpoint the victim ’s location			2
found : it turned out , @entity29 was n't at home , but at work			0
she was finally found at an apartment where she is a housekeeper on @entity26 's @entity79 and was taken to @entity80 ( pictured ) where she remains for the rest of the day , @entity32 stayed on the phone with @entity29			1
finally , @entity29 was located with the help of @entity70			0
as it turned out , she ’d suffered the stroke at her workplace — an @entity90 apartment where she worked as a housekeeper			2
@entity29 was rushed to @entity80 , where she remains in intensive care			0
and the largely positive outcome can all be traced back to the heroic efforts of @entity32 who remained diligent throughout the day - long search			1
‘ i have no doubt that without the efforts of all involved , ’ wrote @entity99			0
[ that the ] outcome would not have been positive			0

@entity9 dispatcher @entity8 kept stroke victim @entity23 calm and *conscious* while emergency workers *scoured* @entity26 for an entire day in search of the woman
