a fire department that sponsors a controversial cull of squirrels in a village in @entity4 has come under fire from animal rights protestors			1
the @entity9 , in the @entity7 , in eastern @entity8 , has been hosting ' @entity10 ' , an event promoting the hunting of the animals for prizes , for the past six years			2
this year 's event , set to take place on february 16 , includes a 14 years and under prize category , a move that has drawn the ire of animal advocates			1
more than 7,500 people have signed petitions started by animal charity @entity23 and @entity25 animal rights activist @entity24 calling for a halt to the event			1
the annual ' @entity10 ' in @entity28 , @entity4 , has attracted criticism after offering youngsters prizes to kill the woodland animals			1
file picture the @entity23 petition , which will be presented to mayor @entity35 , @entity33 states : ' with so much controversy surrounding guns , and guns in the hands of children , the public is outraged that this event targets a children â€™s category that allows a child to take home money for killing squirrels			1
' it is a sadistic form of entertainment that is sponsored by the @entity9			0
although it is stated that this event follows all the hunting rules of the state of the @entity4 , it does not mean that just because it is legal , that it is morally right			1
' the @entity9 is said to follow federal , state and local standards , and yet it is unreal that they promote such act of violence in the hands of young people or that the whole state of @entity4 finds this event as something that represents their culture and beliefs			1
the annual cull is in its seventh year and is sponsored by the @entity9 , a volunteer service			0
file picture under @entity4 state regulations , 12 - 15 year - olds can hunt small game , which includes game birds , small mammals - such as squirrel and rabbit - and reptiles and amphibians			2
young hunters must have completed a hunter education course and have a junior hunting license			0
hunters aged between 12 and 13 must be accompanied by a parent , legal guardian , or a person who is 21 years or older and fully - licensed and accredited , while 14 - 15 - year - olds youth must be accompanied by an 18 - year - old			0
hunting with rifles for big game like deer and bear is still prohibited for those under 14 in @entity4			2
it continues : ' just this past december 24 , the nation saw the fatal shooting of two firemen in western @entity4 , yet the @entity9 has no respect for those that lost their lives , and continues patronizing this senseless massacre for what they call a " tradition "			0
' there is also a @entity106 page , ' stop the 7th annual " @entity108 " @entity28 @entity107 ' which now has nearly 1,000 followers			0
the @entity9 is a volunteer organisation and was not available for comment at time of writing			0
however , the website states that the event follows all the hunting rules of the state of the @entity4			2
the website www.holleyfire.com has recently posted on their website an event that calls for people to register in the adult and the youth category of the event , although it was today inaccessible .			0
