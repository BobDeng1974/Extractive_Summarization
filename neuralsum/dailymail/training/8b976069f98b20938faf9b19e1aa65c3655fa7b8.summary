by @entity0 last updated at 3:49 pm on 30th october 2011 in a chilling photograph unearthed last week , the @entity2 hockey team look on nonchalantly as they are confronted with the @entity5 salute , and three sharp cries of ‘ @entity7 ’			1
now one of the boys in the image has revealed how they got their own back on their @entity13 opponents – by taking photographs on the away leg of their sporting clash that would provide vital intelligence to the @entity19 bombers			1
@entity20 , who was 15 at the time of the ‘ friendly ’ game in march 1939 , has told how the schoolboys travelled to @entity24 in the @entity26 valley a few weeks later for a return match			2
@entity28 : the @entity2 hockey team playing at home to a @entity13 side were stunned when their opponents suddenly clicked to attention and gave the hated @entity5 salute during their trip , they visited the new @entity37 dam , taking sightseeing photographs that would provide invaluable information about its design for @entity19 ’s daring raids on the nearby @entity42 and @entity43 dams four years later			1
mr @entity20 , now 88 , said that he submitted his holiday snaps after the government appealed for any pictures of @entity13 infrastructure citizens might have			1
‘ they asked for any photographs of the dams on the @entity26 and the @entity54 , ’ he recalled from his home in @entity49 , @entity50			2
‘ i had taken pictures from the top of the dam			1
‘ i gave them everything i had			2
it allowed our people to look at the way the @entity13 dams were constructed			1
it might have helped the @entity19			2
got his own back : @entity20 , pictured here during his @entity66 days , took pictures on his school hockey team 's away leg in @entity13 which provided vital intelligence to the @entity19 bombers ‘ at the time i had no idea that the photographs would mean anything at all			1
i ca n’t really recall what the dam looked like , though i seem to remember some big spherical boulders			2
it was just part of the sightseeing trip			2
’ although @entity37 was not targeted by @entity81 ’s bombers , information about the construction of the dams was vital in ensuring @entity86 ’s bouncing bombs would avoid defences and strike vulnerable points			2
the 1943 raids caused flooding , badly damaging @entity13 production , including the @entity93 arms factory in @entity24			1
mr @entity20 , who thinks he is the third boy along in the photograph , obscured but wearing glasses , said : ‘ it was just a routine hockey match			1
‘ beforehand , the dear old master mr @entity97 said , “ they are going to line up and they will give you their normal salute			0
you are not to laugh , grimace or make any other gesture			0
just be @entity104 and when they have done it , get on with the match			0
” there was no hatred			0
this is what they did , then they played hockey			1
we did not know then what it meant			0
we had no idea of the horrors to come			0
’ mr @entity20 said that during their visit to @entity13 , they went to a @entity123 meeting			1
he said : ‘ we were entertained by a @entity123 and , typically of @entity104 youngsters , we wanted a souvenir			0
i got a bayonet with a @entity123 badge on the handle			0
’ the picture of the @entity5 salute was discovered by former @entity132 newsreader @entity131 , 77 , and an archivist for the @entity134			0
mr @entity131 said : ‘ although i was a pupil at the grammar school from 1943 this was the first time i had heard of the incident , and i do n’t mind admitting that it sent a shiver down my spine			1
’ mr @entity20 later served as an infantryman with the @entity142 , seeing action at @entity144			0
after demob , he worked for a bank and a chemical firm and ran the village post office in @entity149 , @entity50 , with his wife @entity150 , 80 , for 26 years until they retired in 1990			0
he added : ‘ it is a shame but i think all the others in the hockey team have died			1
i can remember the names of some of them : @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , and @entity160 was the goalkeeper			0
‘ it was so strange to see that photograph after all these years			0
they were our guests and at that time i do n’t think anyone was serious about the @entity167			0

*teenager* took pictures on school hockey team 's away leg in @entity13 and passed them to government
