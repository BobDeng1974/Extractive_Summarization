but this year 's over-all winner is a @entity10 photographer who got up close and personal with @entity10 elephants to capture the moment they congregated around a still body of water that caught their reflections , while one of the baby mammals ran past			1
a 14 - year - old photographer won @entity21 of the year 2013 for his image of gharial crocodiles that sees a mother croc wearing her brood on her head , which looks a little like a crown made of crocodiles			1
essence of elephants : @entity10 photographer @entity32 beat almost 43,000 entries from 96 countries to be crowned this year 's winner with his enigmatic portrait of @entity10 elephants in the @entity38 in @entity39			1
the image was taken from a hide at ground - level using a slow shutter speed to create an atmosphere and show the giant animals in a ghostly way mother 's little headful : @entity50 's image shows gharial crocodiles on the banks of the @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55 - an area increasingly under threat from illegal sand mining and fishing			1
the hatchlings swam onto a female 's head , presumably because they felt safe there , said the young photographer the winners of the competition were announced at a gala held at the @entity68 , where the photographs will go on show to the public from october 18			1
@entity10 photographer @entity32 beat almost 43,000 entries from 96 countries to be crowned this year 's winner with his enigmatic portrait of @entity10 elephants in the @entity38 in @entity39			1
called essence of elephants , the image was takn from a hide at ground - level using a slow shutter speed to create an atmosphere and show the giant animals in a ghostly way			1
mr @entity32 used a wide - angle lens tilted up to emphasise the size of whatever elephant entered the foreground and chose a narrow aperture to create a large depth of field so that any elephants in the background would also be in focus , as well as using a polarising filter			1
@entity93 moment : @entity95 photographed the famous @entity97 macaques around the hot springs of @entity99 and was fascinated by the surreal effects created by the arrival of a cold wind			1
occasionally , a blast would blow through the steam rising off the pools and if it was snowing , the result would be a mesmerising pattern of swirling steam and snowflakes , which would whirl around any macaques warming up in the pools			2
he waited in the snow until an adult appeared and jumped on a rock in the middle of the pool			2
' when i started shaking off the snow , i knew this was the moment , ' he said the fact that most images of polar bears show them on ice says more about the practical difficulties faced by humans than it does about the bears ' behaviour			1
mr @entity131 took his boat to @entity133 , @entity134 and spotted this bear 30 miles offshore			2
' i approached her very slowly and then drifted			2
it was a cat - and - mouse game			1
i could hear her slow breathing as she watched me below the surface or the exhalation as she surfaced , increasingly curious			0
it was very special , ' he said			0
the midnight sun was filtered through smoke from forest fires raging farther south , a symptom of the warming @entity148 however , while considerable skill was required to create the final picture , the photographer got lucky when a baby elephant raced past the hide so close that he could ahve touched her , allowing mr @entity32 to capture the movement seen in the final picture			1
ever since he first picked up a camera , mr @entity32 has photographed @entity10 elephants			1
he said : ‘ for many years i ’ve wanted to create an image that captures their special energy and the state of consciousness that i sense when i ’m with them			1
this image comes closest to doing that			1
’ ' my goal was to throw caution to the wind ; to abandon conventional photographic practices in an attempt to capture a unique elephant portrait			1
this image hints at the special energy i feel when i am with elephants , ' he added			1
mr @entity32 's photo will take centre stage at the forthcoming exhibition that celebrates the rich array of life on our planet , reflecting its beauty and also highlighting its fragility			0
after its @entity185 premiere , the exhibition embarks on a @entity187 and international tour , to be enjoyed by millions of people across the world			1
the cauldron : @entity192 's photograph is the only one not to contain an animal			0
on november 29 2012 heard that @entity194 - one of the two volcanoes in the @entity197 volcanic plateau in @entity198 - had begun to erupt			1
he boarded a helicopter to get a photograph of the event and despite hot air buffeting the helicopter , mr @entity192 strapped himself to the open door of the aircraft and kept taking photographs dive buddy : the beaches of the @entity209 , @entity210 are traditional nesting sites for the endangered green turtle , which attract tourists			2
' the turtles are so used to seeing people in the water that they think we 're just part of the environment , ' said mr @entity221			2
' this metre - long female , grazing on seagrass , took no notice of me , apart from glancing up briefly ' chair of the judging panel , accomplished wildlife photographer @entity227 said : ' @entity32 ’s image immediately catapults us to @entity10 plains			1
this image stood out for both its technical excellence and the unique moment it captures – it is truly a once in a lifetime shot			1
' fourteen - year - old photographer @entity50 has also been recognised as @entity238 2013 for his image called @entity241 ’s little headful			1
it shows an arresting scene of gharial crocodiles on the banks of the @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55 - an area increasingly under threat from illegal sand mining and fishing			1
to take the photograph , mr @entity50 camped near a nesting colony of gharials on the banks of the @entity53 – two groups of them , each with more than 100 hatchlings			1
the spat : @entity259 's @entity258 was the setting for a jaguar fight			0
a male appeared and approached a female , who was lying in what appeared to be a pose of enticement but she rose , growled and suddenly charged , slamming the male back as he reared up to avoid her outstretched claws			0
the pair then disappeared into the undergrowth to resume their courtship sticky situation : in may , the seafaring lesser noddies head for land to breed			0
their arrival on the tiny island of @entity279 in the @entity280 coincides with peak web size for the red - legged golden orb - web spiders			2
the female spiders , which can grow to the size of a hand , create colossal webs up to 1.5 metres in diameter in which the tiny males gather that can catch passing birds			0
noddies regularly fly into the webs			0
this bird was exhausted , said mr @entity294 said freed the bird to save it from its fate before daybreak , he crept down and hid behind rocks beside the babies			0
‘ i could hear them making little grunting sounds , ’ he said			0
‘ very soon a large female surfaced near the shore , checking on her charges			0
some of the hatchlings swam to her and climbed onto her head			0
perhaps it made them feel safe			0
’ it turned out that she was the chief female of the group , looking after all the hatchlings			0
gharials were once found in rivers all over the @entity55 subcontinent but today just 200 or so breeding adults remain in just two per cent of the former range			0
mr @entity50 said : ‘ the @entity53 is the gharial ’s last stronghold but is threatened by illegal sand - mining and fishing			1
’ other finalists captured a variety of animals from fighting jaguars and a to a monkey in @entity97 shaking snow from its coat to create a flurry of flakes			0
they also got involved in the shots including interacting with a turtle underwater , freeing a bird from a sticky spiderweb and even risking life and limb to capture a volcanic eruption			2
lucky pounce : mr @entity337 spotted this fox in @entity339 , @entity340			0
it quartered the grassland , back and forth , and then started staring intently at a patch of ground , giving the photographer just enough warning of the action to come			2
when it sprung up , @entity348 got his shot			0
and when it landed , the fox got his mouse @entity192 's photograph is the only one not to contain an animal			0
on november 29 2012 he received a phone call he had been waiting for to tell him that @entity194 - one of the two volcanoes in the @entity197 volcanic plateau in @entity198 - had begun to erupt			2
' i 've gone to the area many times , but it had been 36 years since the last eruption , so i dropped everything and went , ' he said			0
he had to take a helicopter in temperatures as low as -40 degrees @entity366 and flew towards the cloud of ash , smoke and steam to wait until a strong wind parted the clouds and he had a fleeting glimpse of the crater			0
in these moments he could see a 200 - metre high fountain of lava and fast - flowing molten rivers of lave running down the volcano , sweeping away all nature in their path			2
despite hot air buffeting the helicopter , mr @entity192 strapped himself to the open door of the aircraft and kept taking photographs			2
' i just kept shooting , changing lenses and camera angles , knowing i had one chance , hoping that i 'd take one image that might do justice to what i was witnessing , ' he said			2
the flight path : this female barred owl had a territory in @entity399 , @entity400			0
mr @entity337 watched her for some time , familiarising himself with her flight paths until he knew her well enough to set up the shot			0
he set up his camera and put a dead mouse on a platform above the camera and waited for the swoop			0
' she grabbed the mouse , flew back to her perch and began calling to her mate			0
it is one of the most exciting calls to hear in the wild , ' he said			0

a @entity10 photographer who got up close to @entity10 elephants to capture the moment they congregated around a still body of water while a baby ran past , won the overall competition
fourteen - year - old photographer @entity50 has also been recognised as @entity238 2013 for his image of crocodiles called @entity241 ’s little headful
the photographs will go on show to the public at the @entity435 , @entity185 , from october 18 before a national tour
