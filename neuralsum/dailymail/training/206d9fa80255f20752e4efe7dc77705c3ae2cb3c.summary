@entity0 dealt the @entity1 a significant blow on thursday by withdrawing just three days before he was due to attempt a 5,000 and 10,000 metres double			1
the world and @entity6 champion ’s ‘ tough decision ’ was hardly a surprise , given @entity8 spent two days in hospital with abdominal pains only three weeks ago and missed a substantial block of training , but his timing left fans and @entity1 organisers disappointed			1
images of @entity18 ’s greatest distance runner have been widely used to promote these games and trumpet the stature of the athletics competition			0
@entity44 ( cycling ) - @entity47 ' 2013 world champion misses games with knee problem @entity51 ( athletics ) - veteran pulled out of @entity28 's men 's sprint relay squad to concentrate on @entity54 @entity55 ( boxing ) - @entity47 ' @entity6 silver medallist did not travel to @entity22 after having his accreditation refused			1
@entity59 ( athletics ) - opted out to concentrate on @entity60 @entity61 ( athletics ) - only running the 10,000m , was picked to double up @entity65 ( athletics ) - charged with doping offences and not selected @entity68 ( jam , 100m ) - another with doping offences , ban was reduced but has only raced once on comeback @entity73 ( athletics ) - @entity75 100m and 200m @entity6 silver medallist has opted against racing in @entity22 to focus on his build - up to the @entity79 @entity81 ( athletics ) - missed @entity75 trials so only granted relay spot , along with ... @entity84 ( athletics ) @entity6 800m champion @entity86 will provide some much - needed stardust and @entity84 is scheduled to compete in the 4x100m relay over the final weekend , but the second fastest man in history , @entity73 , has long said the @entity1 were not in his ‘ best interests ’			1
@entity8 ’s withdrawal is another setback for @entity28 ’s chances of success at @entity96			2
@entity37 , the favourite for heptathlon gold in the absence of new mother @entity25 , has been forced to pull out with a left foot injury and world 400m champion @entity101 only runs in the 4x400m relay			0
@entity8 ’s withdrawal means that , of the three athletes who won @entity6 gold on ‘ @entity106 ’ at @entity107 , only long jumper @entity103 is here			1
@entity22 2014 chief executive , @entity109 , said : ‘ there ’s no question we ’re disappointed that @entity0 announced he would be withdrawing			2
we ’re very disappointed for @entity0			0
we knew how much he wanted to be here			0
‘ i ’m sure there will be some disappointed people , but there are plenty of great athletes here			0
’ @entity8 , 31 , has opted to stay at his training base at altitude in @entity122 in @entity123 , rather than travel to @entity22 , after finally deciding on wednesday night he is not in good enough shape			1
it is understood he considered forfeiting the 5,000m on sunday to give him five days ’ extra recovery for the 10,000m on friday , but ultimately opted to sidestep the @entity1 altogether after discussions with his coach , @entity131 , and @entity134 performance director @entity133			0
@entity8 said in a statement : ‘ i have taken the tough decision to withdraw from the @entity1			2
the sickness i had two weeks ago was a big setback for me			0
training is getting better here in @entity122 but i need another few weeks to get back to the level i was at in 2012 and 2013			2
@entity142 out of @entity1 blow for @entity22 : @entity84 will only take part in the 100m relay while @entity73 ( below ) has pulled out ‘ i really wanted to add the @entity1 titles to my @entity6 and @entity146 but the event is coming a few weeks too soon for me as my body is telling me it ’s not ready to race yet			1
’ @entity8 is still , however , intending to compete in the 5,000m and 10,000m at the @entity54 in @entity149 in august , and @entity134 officials remain confident he will finally reach the start line after pulling out of the @entity22 @entity153 and @entity154 in recent weeks			1
his competition within @entity157 , is significantly inferior to @entity158 he might have faced in @entity22 — including @entity160 , 21 , who has run @entity161 for 5,000m this year			0
@entity8 has managed only 13min 23.42sec , after he returned to the track following his eighth place in the @entity24 in april , but was understood to be ‘ flying ’ in training in the @entity166 before suffering stomach pains			2
on top of the world : @entity8 won two @entity170 in @entity171 in 2012			0
