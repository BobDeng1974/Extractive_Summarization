a teenage girl who felt like @entity1 after suffering from a cancer that gave her 20 tumours in her neck has entered a beauty pageant to regain her confidence			1
@entity7 , 18 , was only diagnosed with thyroid cancer in june this year but has made an incredible recovery			1
doctors found 20 tumours growing in her - one the size of a @entity13 - and acted quickly to remove them			2
the 18 - year - old had the tumours removed through surgery this summer and resulting scar left her feeling like @entity1 as a result of the surgery , @entity7 was left with a scar running down the side of her neck from just below her right ear			1
despite the major surgery only taking place four months ago , the teenager from @entity15 , @entity29 , is already into the finals of miss @entity29			2
@entity7 said : ' when i woke up from surgery i felt like @entity1 - there was this massive scar			1
' i had always been confident about my looks beforehand , but it made me really insecure			0
' i 'm starting to feel better about myself now and i want to use the pageant to raise awareness of thyroid cancer			2
' it goes under the radar a bit and does n't get as much press as it should			0
' @entity7 spent much of the summer in hospital recovering from surgery @entity7 was n't aware of the massive lump in her throat and only went to the doctor after weeks of being tired			2
as an avid horse rider , she was used to getting up early and being very active			0
all of a sudden the 18 - year - old found it impossible to get out of bed and was constantly drained of energy			1
@entity7 said : ' i felt silly going to the doctors ' just ' because i was tired			0
' the doctor asked me to swallow and immediately noticed the lump in my throat			0
' i had a biopsy that did n't show anything but a subsequent ct scan showed i had 20 tumours in my throat - one was even the size of a satsuma			0
the scar that was left after surgery left @entity7 feeling insecure about her looks ' after they confirmed it was cancer i had a course of radio - iodine treatment to kill off the cancerous cells			1
' since recovering from her treatment , and subsequently celebrating her 18th birthday , @entity7 has raised more than Â£ 1000 for thyroid cancer charities			1
she is hoping that by appearing - and hopefully winning - in the finals of miss @entity29 on sunday november 2 will increase donations			0
the 18 - year - old said : ' of course i 'd love to win - just like all of the girls involved			1
' the main thing for me though is to raise awareness and make sure people are more aware of the symptoms			0
' fingers crossed we can make a bit more money too ! '			0
