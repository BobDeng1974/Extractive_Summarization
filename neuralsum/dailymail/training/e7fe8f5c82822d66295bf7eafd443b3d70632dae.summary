by @entity0 published : 03:48 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 04:32 est , 11 september 2012 @entity1 has revealed new pictures of @entity3 ' looking back ' at one of its cameras on the martian surface			1
it comes as they confirmed the rover has now tested its robotic arm successfully , using a 1909 penny and a piece of rock from @entity15 to calibrate its instruments			1
the team admitted even they were surprised by the quality of images being sent back after dust covers were removed from the rover 's main cameras			0
@entity1 today released this incredible image of @entity3 on the red planet , showing off its wheels and four ' navcams ' which act as the rover 's eyes on the red planet			0
' wow , seeing these images after all the tremendous hard work that has gone into making them possible is a profoundly emotional moment , ' said @entity35 principal investigator @entity34 of @entity36 , @entity37			1
' it is so exciting to see the camera returning beautiful , sharp images from @entity41			0
' @entity1 's @entity3 stepped through activities on sept. 7 , 8 and 9 designed to check and characterize precision movements by the rover 's robotic arm and use of tools on the arm			1
the activities confirmed good health and usefulness of @entity35 , or @entity35 , and used that camera to check arm placement during several positioning activities			1
@entity35 took an image with its reclosable dust cover open for the first time on @entity41 , confirming sharp imaging capability that had been obscured by a thin film of dust on the cover during previous use of the camera			0
it took images of cameras at the top of @entity3 's mast , of the underbelly of the rover and of @entity35 's own calibration target , among other pointings			0
the camera 's calibration target includes a 1909 @entity76 penny that @entity34 purchased for this purpose			1
the team calibrated the camera using a ' lucky penny ' on the rover 's mast ' we 're seeing the penny in the foreground and , looking past it , a setting i 'm sure the people who minted these coins never imagined , ' @entity34 said			2
the penny is a nod to geologists ' tradition of placing a coin or other object of known scale as a size reference in close - up photographs of rocks , and it gives the public a familiar object for perceiving size easily when it will be viewed by @entity35 on @entity41			2
' the folks who drive the rover 's arm and turret have taken a 220 - pound arm through some very complex tai chi , to center a penny in an image that 's only a few centimeters across , ' said @entity35 deputy principal investigator @entity112 of the @entity114 - based @entity113			1
' they make the impossible look easy			0
' the arm characterization activities , including more imaging by @entity35 , will continue for a few days before @entity3 resumes driving toward a mid-term science destination area called @entity119			2
in that area , the rover may use its scoop to collect a soil sample , and later its drill to collect a sample of powder from inside a rock			2
curiosity is five weeks into a two - year prime mission on @entity41			0
it will use 10 science instruments to assess whether the selected study area ever has offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life			0
a sample of basaltic rock from a lava flow in @entity15 serves as a calibration target for the rover 's @entity140 - made @entity139 @entity1 today revealed stunning new images of @entity3 's wheel on the martian surface taken using the high resolution @entity35 camera , which had its dustcover removed for the first time wheels down : @entity1 used the newly uncovered @entity35 camera to take a series of images of the rover 's wheel on the red planet 's surface the new images also give tantalising views of the nearby mountains that @entity3 will eventually climb in its quest for for ingredients of life on the red planet the images also reveal @entity3 's large wheels and distinctive tyre tracks , which leave morse code messages on the surface as it travels video : @entity1 scientists explain where @entity3 currently is on its mission ...			1

*engineers* say seeing latest pictures were a ' profoundly emotional moment '
