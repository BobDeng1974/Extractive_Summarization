by @entity0 the famous battle took place nearly 1,000 years ago , but the badly scarred skull of a man could be the first - ever recorded victim of the @entity6			1
experts have revealed that it belongs to a 45 - year - old man who was hacked six times with a sword to the back of his head – and could provide first - hand evidence of the brutal battle of 1066			1
no bones have previously been discovered of anyone who fought and died during the historic event			1

experts have revealed that it belongs to a 45 - year - old man who was hacked six times with a sword to the back of his head the skeleton belongs to a 45 - year - old man and was found in @entity30 , @entity31			1
scientists believe the man was likely to have been involved in fighting at the time of the @entity35 invasion and the @entity6			1
his skull shows that he was hacked six times with a sword at the back of his head			1
one osteoarcheologist said : ‘ the first injury was probably a cut to the right side of the ear and upper jaw			0
‘ this was then followed by a series of sword cuts , all delivered from the left hand side behind the victim , in a downward and horizontal motion			2
’ bone analysis also revealed that the man ate a diet rich in marine fish			2
he had some spinal abnormalities , suffered from sinus infections , and had lost a few teeth			0
he also had two small tumours on his skull and had sustained another head injury up to two years before he was killed			2
the skull forms part of a skeleton that was first dug up in 1994 during excavations in @entity30 , @entity65 - around 20 miles from the famous battlefield			1
bones were originally sent to experts at the @entity69 as part of preparations to celebrate the 750th anniversary of the @entity73			1
but radiocarbon testing of the remains at the @entity76 dated them to 28 years either side of 1063			2
scientists believe the man was therefore likely to have been involved in fighting at the time of the @entity35 invasion and the @entity6			1
based upon the way he was buried , they think he was probably @entity85			1

‘ when i heard the news i was completely gobsmacked			0

’ @entity244 said : ‘ this is a fascinating discovery and a potentially very interesting piece of evidence from the second half of the 11th century			0
it certainly demonstrates the violence of the period			0
‘ it would be a reasonable hypothesis that this individual could have some links to the @entity145 , but further research is essential in understanding the potential significance of this skeleton			0
’ a new battle : in late 2013 , experts claimed that @entity159 died with an arrow in his eye not at the site of @entity263 ( which has a dedicated vistor 's centre - but on a spot that is now a roundabout on the @entity267 in late 2013 , experts claimed that @entity159 died with an arrow in his eye not at the site of @entity263 ( which has a dedicated vistor 's centre - but on a spot that is now a roundabout on the @entity267			1
archaeologists from @entity273 's time team excavated grounds around the @entity263 and the other site proposed by historian @entity276			2
they found no evidence that either place was where the army of @entity153 triumphed over the forces of @entity159 , the @entity106 @entity159			0
using aerial laser imaging , @entity281 then mapped the terrain - on the basis of which a group of experts agreed that the most likely location for the battle was a roundabout joining @entity290 and @entity291 in the town of @entity19			1
@entity281 said the mapping had ‘ proved ’ that the traditional battlefield - on the land directly below the @entity263 - would have been too boggy for @entity152 ’s cavalry			1
‘ military analysts studied the data to see where @entity159 , a skilled commander , would most probably have mounted his defence , ’ explained a @entity273 spokesman			0
‘ they identified the only ideal battlefield			0
it seems @entity159 ’s fearsome @entity158 shield wall straddled a narrow strategic pass that is on today ’s @entity267			0

remains were found @entity30 , @entity65 - around 20 miles from the famous battlefield - on the site of a medieval hospital
they belong to a 45 - year - old - man who took six sword blows to the top of his head before dying
scientists used radio carbon dating to conclude that the man was probably involved in fighting at the time of the @entity35 invasion
they think he was likely @entity85 because of the way he was buried
no bones have previously been recovered of anyone who fought and died in the battle of 1066 and experts are *excited* by the discovery
