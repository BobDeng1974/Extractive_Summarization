the city that never sleeps spent the night at a virtual standstill and cloaked in darkness , waking up today to deal with the aftermath of @entity15 which has so far claimed the lives of 18 people and caused what is expected to be $ 20billion of damage			1
as daylight finally illuminated the streets this morning , @entity1 were faced with a flooded subway , shuttered financial markets , closed schools , deserted streets and many homes still without power after a night which saw a wall of sea water and high winds slam into the city			1
homes devastated by fire and the effects of @entity15 at @entity38 borough water floods the @entity40 in lower @entity41 , @entity1 and debris fills the steps a man looks at the flooded @entity45 after @entity15 left most of lower @entity41 without power buildings were destroyed , tunnels going into and out of @entity41 were flooded , dozens of trees and power lines were felled and thousands had fled from their homes			1
some would have no homes to return to after at least 50 in the @entity38 area flooded and caught fire			1
this morning , there were police officers on every corner , patrol cars circling the neighborhoods on the lookout for looters and casualties			1
traffic lights were down and streets and subways were eerily empty			1
those on the streets seemed confused as to what to do and how to go about it			2
high above midtown , the broken boom of a crane continued to dangle precariously over a neighborhood			2
@entity1 police officers put up police tape in front of a subway station today a playground stands surrounded by water pushed up by @entity15 in @entity81 , @entity1 the city 's subway , which is 108 years old , has never faced a disaster as devastating as last night , an @entity83 spokesman said today			1
' we knew that this was going to be a very dangerous storm , and the storm has met our expectations , ' mayor @entity87 said today			2
' this is a once - in - a - long - time storm			2
' from 8pm last night , lower @entity41 was bathed in darkness as the power went out from one neighborhood to another like a domino effect			2
soon after , the city 's cell phone networks stopped working leaving people in virtual obscurity			1
' we see a pop. the whole sky lights up , ' said @entity106 , 30 , who was watching the storm from the roof of her building in the @entity110			2

' it 's really a complete ghost town now			2
' @entity125 , 15 , a tourist from @entity126 , was watching television in her hotel when a voice came over the loudspeaker and told everyone to leave			0
' they said to take only what we needed , and leave the rest , because we 'll come back in two or three days , ' she said as she and hundreds of others gathered in the luggage - strewn marble lobby			0
' it could be several days to a week before all residents who lost power during the storm get their lights back , officials said			0

in uptown @entity41 , windows of apartments and businesses glowed and curious faces peered from windows , eager to see the damage			1
but to cross through midtown was to be swallowed by darkness			0
only a few emergency or backup lights appeared in buildings			0
further downtown , only the flicker of candlelight could be seen from windows , the usually bustling financial district was both flooded with water and cloaked in darkness			0
even though the worst of the storm had passed , authorities warned people to be on the alert when moving around today for falling debris , felled trees and downed power lines			1
a woman looks and gestures at debris left behind along the @entity186 ' this will be one for the record books , ' said @entity189 , senior vice president for electric operations at @entity190			0
' this will be the largest storm - related outage in our history			0
' ' folks do n't realize that this is the most dangerous time , ' @entity195 , a municipal prosecutor for the town of @entity197 , told @entity200			0
' your guard is down , you think your family is safe , the storm is over ... then you step on a rusty nail , a branch falls on you during cleanup , or you wade through a puddle and there is a live wire			0
' a man uses his mobile phone to photograph a closed and flooded subway station in lower @entity41 ' it ’s the worst i ’ve seen , ' said @entity217 , watching the storm from his home in @entity220 , @entity221 ' the ocean is in the road , there are trees down everywhere			0
i ’ve never seen it this bad			0
' ' we are at the mercy of the @entity83 -- our staff has to be able to get to work -- and @entity190 , ' restaurateur @entity231 wrote in an e-mail to @entity233			0
his @entity234 flooded and he ’s waiting in @entity221 without power , to hear how @entity236 and @entity237 fared in the storm			0
' as the storm has come and gone , time will tell how we all fared , the degree of damage suffered , the amount of lives sadly lost to this natural disaster and how long it will take before the city that never sleeps resumes being the be-all and end - all for so many of us			1
