by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:17 est , 14 may 2012 updated : 02:20 est , 15 may 2012 evidence : @entity3 , @entity4 's former spin doctor , appears at the @entity6 inquiry today @entity4 took three calls from @entity9 during the frenetic run - up to the @entity11 , his former spin chief confirmed yesterday			1
but @entity3 insisted that the then prime minister was never told what to do by the media mogul			2
he told the @entity15 into media standards that , in the three calls , he believed mr @entity9 had just wanted ‘ a chat about what is going on ’			1
he added : ‘ i was never witness to and do n’t believe there was ever a discussion that said , “ now , @entity28 , if you do this and this and this , my papers will back you ”			2
’ mr @entity4 faced criticism that his government had placed few restrictions on the operation of @entity34 ’s newspapers or @entity35 , in which @entity34 owned a 39.1 per cent stake , during his time in office			1
mr @entity3 admitted mr @entity4 was grateful for mr @entity9 ’s backing , particularly during the build - up to the @entity41 , when the prime minister was accused of following @entity44 leader @entity43 blindly into war			1
the @entity50 switched support to the @entity52 he said : ‘ it was perfectly clear that most of the media were opposed to what we were doing and mr @entity9 ’s titles were in favour , and i think it ’s also fair to say that the prime minister would have appreciated that support			1
’ asked why mr @entity4 made time for three calls during a period of frantic diplomacy , mr @entity3 said : ‘ what i think was going on is that @entity9 has placed a call and @entity4 has taken that call , and @entity9 is just wanting to have a chat			1
‘ he is a news man			0
i think it is a combination of @entity9 trying to find out what is going on and also probably saying , “ you know , we ’re going to support you on this ”			2
’ mr @entity3 said @entity74 records showed the two men had spoken on the phone a total of only six times between 2002 and 2005			1
he conceded that mr @entity4 would have been ‘ crazy ’ not to want the media mogul ’s backing but denied the two men had made a deal in 1995 , when the @entity52 leader attended the @entity34 annual conference on @entity84 , off @entity85			1
in written evidence to the inquiry , he said : ‘ it ’s simply not the case to say no big decision was taken without @entity9 ’s reaction being taken into account			2
‘ i could list dozens of policy decisions on which he would have had no advance knowledge , from budgets to @entity98 ’s speeches to peace processes and military action			0
’ mr @entity3 said mr @entity9 had tended to use the back door during his visits to @entity103 , but said other visitors had employed the same method of entry if they wanted to avoid cameras outside the front door			1
mr @entity9 ’s former right - hand man @entity109 hit back yesterday at a parliamentary committee which had accused him of ‘ selective amnesia ’ while giving evidence into phone hacking			1
in a damning report , mps claimed the ex-chairman of @entity117 had misled @entity118 and was ‘ complicit ’ in a cover - up over the scale of the scandal at the @entity122			2
but mr @entity109 described the findings as ‘ unfair , unfounded and erroneous ’ and demanded that the @entity125 ’s allegations be withdrawn			2
press reform : @entity3 told the @entity6 inquiry today he thought there was a lack of political will to reform the way the media is regulated the @entity15 website was today apparently brought down by hackers as @entity3 gave evidence			1
the website provides live video coverage of the hearing as well as copies of witness statements			0
on @entity141 users were blaming hacking group @entity142 - but no one had claimed responsibility for the site			0
@entity142 and @entity146 have previously claimed they have hacked into government and @entity117 websites			0
users said the website homepage had gone blank - although others were having no difficulties getting on it at all			0
it is possible that rather than being hacked there was an internal problem with the website			0
a spokesman for the inquiry said they were investigating the problems			0
lack of political will : @entity162 said the @entity6 inquiry had given rise to a ' chilling atmosphere ' which threatened freedom of speech in the @entity167 @entity3 also said that @entity168 did not want to set up the @entity6 inquiry and there was a lack of political will to reform press regulation			1
mr @entity3 said comments made at a @entity175 lunch by @entity162 in february were part of a wider government strategy			1
the @entity178 said the inquiry had given rise to a ' chilling atmosphere ' which threatened freedom of speech in the @entity167			0
when asked if there was a political will to regulate the media , mr @entity3 replied : ' no , if i 'm being frank			1
i thought that @entity162 's speech to the parliamentary gallery was part of the political strategy			0
' i do n't think that @entity168 particularly wants to have to deal with this			2
' i do n't think he wanted to set up the inquiry			0
he had to in the end			0
' i think it will be very difficult for him not to go along with whatever recommendations - or at least a very large part of the recommendations - the inquiry produces			0
but i do n't think there 's much of an appetite			0
' meanwhile , mr @entity3 said that mr @entity4 and other members of the @entity52 government had long believed there was a ' real problem ' in the relationship between the press and @entity205 , they did not take action to address the issues			1
' i think there was a political point of pragmatism that @entity4 would have taken the view that it was not politically sensible , ' he said			2
' it is no secret that this was one of the few things that we argued about			0
' he added : ' he was further of the view that whereas it was possible to fight and win elections and to govern with consensus with some of the media offside , to seek to do so with all of them offside and in kill mode is very difficult indeed			0
