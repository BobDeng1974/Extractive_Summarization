the doppelgangers will compete in ' @entity1 ' the global lookalike contest held in @entity3 @entity5 impersonator has become so popular he is releasing an album of his own by @entity8 and @entity9 last updated at 11:32 am on 8th september 2011 at first glance they may seem like a rather unlikely group of friends			1
but these famous faces have something in common beyond their star quality			1
they are all professional lookalikes – and caused a few raised eyebrows when they gathered in the unlikely setting of an @entity22 restaurant in @entity23 , @entity24			1
diners at the @entity27 restaurant were stunned to see britney spears ( 7 ) feeding @entity29 ( 10 ) onion bhajis - before whacking him when he pinched one too many			2
@entity29 ’s double @entity31 , 52 , was once chosen by the music mogul as his favourite lookalike , while @entity35 impersonator @entity34 , 27 , has received recognition on the singer ’s website			1
i 'm a lookalike , get me out of here : fourteen doppelgangers at a get - together in @entity23 , @entity24 for those who impersonate celebrities from left : @entity47 ( 1 ) , @entity5 ( 2 ) , @entity48 ( 3 ) , @entity49 ( 4 ) , @entity50 ( 5 ) , @entity51 ( 6 ) , britney spears ( 7 ) , @entity52 ( 8 ) , @entity53 ( 9 ) , @entity29 ( 10 ) , @entity54 ( 11 ) , @entity55 ( 12 ) , @entity56 ( 13 ) , @entity57 ( 14 ) the pair were joined by @entity55 ( 12 ) , or 60 - year - old @entity59 , who earns up to £ 1,000 a week as the late @entity61 opera singer , and @entity62 , 38 , who performs as comedian @entity63 ( 1 )			1
@entity5 ( 2 ) is better known as @entity64 , 44 , but has become so popular as a lookalike that he is even releasing an album of his own			1
@entity68 , 62 , is the spitting image of former @entity70 character @entity48 ( 3 ) , while @entity71 , 47 , has appeared in anything from health and safety videos to charity events as @entity49 ( 4 )			2
taking a break from @entity77 are @entity78 , 40 , who impersonates actor @entity50 ( 5 ) , and @entity79 , 47 , as @entity51 ( 6 )			2
there ’s also @entity57 ( 14 ) in the form of @entity82 , 49 , who says he has been complimented on his act by the singer himself , and @entity56 ( 13 ) played by @entity85 , 32 , who has made a full - time career out of his similarity to the footballer and stood in for him in adverts			2
@entity53 ( 9 ) is better known as @entity90 , 46 , and formula 1 driver @entity54 ( 11 ) goes by the name of @entity92 , 29			2
@entity93 , 74 , is regularly approached for autographs by fans who think he plays @entity52 ( 8 ) in the @entity52			0
do n't hit me , baby : the @entity35 lookalike swings at ' @entity29 ' at a dinner for the best celebrity doppelgangers in @entity101 customers at the restaurant became even more confused when a spat broke out between pop princess spears and music mogul @entity29			1
one said : ' i could n't believe what i was seeing when i saw @entity35 and @entity29 having dinner together			0
' ' it looked friendly at first and even quite intimate with them feeding each other onion bhajis but suddenly he said something and she stood up and slapped him one			0
' it was astonishing and everyone in the restaurant gasped until they both started laughing and explained they were lookalikes			0
' it was hilarious but they really did have everyone fooled			0
people had their mobile phones out filming it thinking they 'd got a big celebrity scoop			0
' before the storm : the ' row ' broke out when it appeared @entity29 had munched on all the onion bhajis at the @entity22 restaurant in @entity23 - on - @entity129 living it large : @entity131 as the late opera singer @entity55 is shown indulging in two glasses of wine while @entity53 's lookalike laughs beside him mind if i try some of that ? @entity56 is joined at dinner by @entity138 and @entity139 from hit comedy @entity77 - or so it would appear the group , led by the @entity55 doppleganger @entity59 , 60 , will compete in the global lookalike contest ' @entity1 ' in @entity3 on february 21 next year			1
@entity59 , who earns up to £ 1,000 a week for appearing as the late opera singer , said : ' we are all looking to fly out to @entity3 to take part in an annual convention for look - a - likes			1
every year , @entity150 romp away with the awards			0
we want to go out there to fly the flag for @entity101			0
' @entity150 like to come first and it is our plan to get a good number of lookalikes together and go over and take part			0
' it will be a bit like the @entity101 @entity161 team but for impersonators			0
we are in touch with a public relations guy and we are putting a package together			0
' can you feel the love tonight ? sir @entity5 's lookalike grabs @entity56 's bottom as they leave the curry restaurant			1
