by @entity0 published : 21:01 est , 10 december 2012 updated : 02:51 est , 11 december 2012 @entity1 : the original @entity3 movie came out in 2009 @entity6 director @entity5 ’s 2011 film , @entity4 , is one of the most repellent exercises in sexual sadism that i have ever witnessed in a cinema			1
its 2009 predecessor , @entity3 , was an amazingly unpleasant horror film about a mad scientist joining three people together surgically			2
evidently , mr @entity5 thought this had n’t gone far enough , for last year he came up with the sequel , which is roughly ten times more extreme , filthy and psychopathic than the original			0
the sadistic anti-hero @entity20 ( played with slobbering relish by @entity22 ) is a huge fan of the first @entity3 movie			0
an obese , inarticulate , retarded man who lives with his mother , @entity20 gets his kicks by abducting motorists from a multi-storey car park and taking them to a disused warehouse , where he attempts to join 12 of them together as a human centipede with one digestive system			0
to this end , he maims , cuts , slices off pieces of anatomy , indulges in sadistic , unskilled dentistry , rapes them and forces them into other vile acts			0
the producers of this exercise in extended sexual aggression proudly advertised it as ‘ a film so sick the @entity47 did n’t want you to see it ! ’ the @entity47 did , indeed , initially deny the film an 18 certificate on the grounds that no amount of cuts could overcome the central problem – that the plot revolves around the sexual arousal of the central character by the torture and degradation of others			1
however , in perhaps the most lily - livered act in its inglorious history , the board reversed that decision after an appeal by the film ’s distributors			1
too far : @entity4 is directed by @entity5 , pictured shocking : a scene from @entity4 , a ' repellent exercise in sexual sadism ' a total of 32 cuts were made , totalling 2 minutes 37 seconds , but these did little to disguise anything that was happening			1
@entity74 : directors such as @entity76 , pictured , would have seen many of their films blocked by the censors before 1996 , says @entity0 sadly , @entity4 is not an isolated example , and one movie – a @entity83 film – is even more disgusting in its celebration of sexual torture			1
the truth is that ever since it let through another exercise in sexual sadism , @entity89 , in 1996 , the @entity47 has repeatedly allowed 18 certificates for films that wallow in sexual degradation , rape and torture			1
mostly these were abstruse foreign - language films			2
more recently , however , a new genre of mainstream , @entity97 - language films has sprung up , often called ‘ torture porn ’ , in which @entity76 and other directors have wallowed in the erotic degradation of both sexes			2
many of these have had ‘ hostel ’ or ‘ @entity113 ’ in the title , but there are dozens of them , and as a film critic i have had the misfortune to see them all			2
none of them would have got past the censors before 1996			1
if , at long last , the authorities are starting to see sense and realise that films like this do influence people in real life , it ’s not before time			0
several questions need to be answered much more honestly than they have been			0
should the opportunists responsible for films like this be ashamed of themselves ? yes			0
do films like this help to brutalise some of those who see them ? of course			0
does the @entity47 care ? not sufficiently			2
do we all have to live with the social and criminal consequences ? yes			0
degrading : so - called ' torture - porn ' films such as @entity137 , pictured , have emerged and ' wallow in the erotic degradation of both sexes ' according to @entity0 slipping standards : censorship has n't been the same according to @entity0 since 1996 film crash , starring @entity143 , pictured , made it through the net			1

@entity0 *describes* the @entity47 *'s* decision to reverse a ban on @entity4 as ' the most lily - livered act in its inglorious history '
he says that such films would never have made it past the censors before *controversial* 1996 film crash
