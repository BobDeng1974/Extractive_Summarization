by @entity0 published : 03:22 est , 4 may 2012 updated : 04:22 est , 4 may 2012 a @entity2 bar owner has sparked outrage by displaying a sign outside his establishment calling @entity6 a ' n * * * er '			1
@entity7 , of @entity8 , insists that the sign beside the @entity10 is not racist and is simply a political protest over the president 's policies			1
yet the owner advertises his drinking hole as a ' @entity16 ' - a clear reference to far - right group the @entity19 - and has a history of catering to some of the most notorious racist organisations in the @entity23 offensive : the large sign calling the @entity23 president a ' n * * * er ' is displayed prominently outside @entity7 's @entity10 the message on @entity7 's sign reads , ' i do not support the n * * * * * in the @entity31			1
' but @entity7 said he ' did not feel bad about anything whatsoever ' , according to @entity34 's @entity33			2
he added : ' i say just because you 're offended by it does n't mean you do n't have the right to say something just the opposite			0
controversial : the @entity2 bar owner says he is not racist , despite calling his establishment a ' @entity16 ' ' therefore , they can go out and put their own sign in their own yard and i will not be offended			1
it is not the first time he has caused uproar by placing offensive slogans outside his bar			2
in 2009 , he installed a sign that read , ' @entity6 's plan for health - care : n * * * * * rig it			2
' again , he maintained it was simply a protest against the government 's policies on healthcare , rather than racist abuse			0
asked why he had chosen to use the word , @entity7 replied , ' well , i 've used it most of my life			2
there are different ways to put your opinion up , but that 's just the words i choose			0
' @entity33 5 reported that @entity8 officials know about the sign , but can do little to prevent it			0
in the @entity23 , hate speech is legal ( except for obscenity , defamation , incitement to riot , and fighting words )			0
laws prohibiting hate speech are unconstitutional in the @entity23 ; the federal government and state governments are broadly forbidden by the @entity83 of the @entity84 from restricting speech			0
unchecked : @entity7 has angered the community previously by displaying similar signs criticising the president using racist language shocking : @entity7 also has displays of prominent black leaders alongside racist imagery inside his @entity8 bar unsuccessful protests have been mounted by the @entity95 [ @entity95 ] , a group of which @entity7 bizarrely once told @entity96 he was a member			1
his signs have been a long - standing issue in the area , as have the displays of prominent black leaders alongside racist imagery inside his bar			1
@entity7 is not the first to protest against mr @entity6 with language that many would consider patently racist			1
@entity103 distributed a much - maligned ' do n't re-n * g in 2012 ' @entity105 bumper sticker			0
she too argued that neither she nor her product were actually racist .			0

@entity7 *horrified* the community with a similar sign at his bar in 2009
@entity112 of the @entity10 *decorated* with racist imagery
@entity7 advertises the establishment as a ' @entity16 '
