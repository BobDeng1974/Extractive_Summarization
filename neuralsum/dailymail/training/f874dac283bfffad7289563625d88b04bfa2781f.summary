@entity1 map : around 13 per cent of @entity2 , including actress @entity3 , have red hair - compared to 1 - 2 per cent of the world population they are often the butt of cruel jibes and perhaps blame it on their parents ’ genes			1
but now research suggests that redheads can in fact put their colouring down to the weather			0
experts believe that @entity2 ’s gloomy climate has seen a deliberate genetic adaptation to help exploit rare sunny days and boost @entity21 production			2
@entity22 , managing director of the @entity24 project , said the country ’s dull weather was responsible for a larger number of flame - haired men and women being born			0
only about 1 - 2 per cent of the world ’s population has red hair but in @entity2 the figure is much higher , with about 13 per cent , or 650,000 people , with flaming locks			1
famous @entity2 with red hair range from @entity37 actress @entity3 to football manager @entity38 , while the @entity41 / @entity40 movie @entity42 features a red - haired @entity2 princess @entity43			1
researchers are investigating how many people carry the red - hair gene and their findings will be used to make a ‘ ginger ’ map of the @entity50			2
mr @entity22 said he wanted to map the number of possible carriers of the gene in @entity2 in a bid to try to explain why so many @entity2 have red hair			1
but yesterday he revealed his own theory , saying : ‘ i think it ’s to do with sunshine			0
we all need @entity21 from sunshine but @entity2 is cloudy			0
‘ we have an @entity63 climate and we need light skin to get as much vitamin d from the sun as possible			0
’ a person who does not have red hair can still produce red - haired children if their partner is a carrier of the gene			1
in the spotlight : famous @entity2 redheads include @entity38 , left , and @entity41 / @entity40 heroine @entity75 , right red hair appears in people with two copies of a recessive gene on chromosome 16 , which causes a mutation			1
but despite concerns that red hair could be dying out , the experts say that it is likely to continue for many more generations			1
the @entity87 think tank recently controversially claimed that redheads suffer more discrimination per head of population than ethnic minorities			0
they conducted an experiment and found that ' a job applicant with ginger hair is seven times more likely to be rejected than a dark - haired applicant , and eight times more likely than a fair - haired applicant			0
' @entity102 , lecturer in psychology at the university of the @entity106 , and herself a redhead , said : ‘ red hair still gives out deep cultural signals			2
' women , for example , are wild and quick - tempered , while ginger - haired men are unattractive and geeky			0

one or two per cent of the world ’s population has red hair but in @entity2 the figure is about 13 per cent
