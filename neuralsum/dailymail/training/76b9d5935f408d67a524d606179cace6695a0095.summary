bullets could have come through the window			0
anything could have happened man			0
they were n’t thinking , they were n’t thinking at all			0

holes were blasted into a townhouse where a 12 - year - old dove for over and a four - month - old baby slept in a crib			0
another neighbor said officers were laughing as they pulled the bullet - riddled bodies of @entity7 and @entity8 from the @entity22			1
' the policemen that had on the black and white vests were out there laughing like it was so funny , ' the neighbor told @entity26			0

when the 13 - year police veteran approached the vehicle , @entity7 shot him in the stomach			1
the fugitive then took the officer 's pistol and sped off in his squad car			2
@entity175 reports that @entity16 could be heard gasping for breath as he radioed in a description of the man who shot him			0
' that set off a frantic manhunt across the city			0

officers spotted him in his grandmother 's blue @entity22 , which witnesses later said he had taken from her home			1
a police pursuit ensued and @entity7 , who was driving with @entity8 , crashed			1
