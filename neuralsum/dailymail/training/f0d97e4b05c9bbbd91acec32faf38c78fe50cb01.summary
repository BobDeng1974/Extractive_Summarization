by @entity0 published : 07:40 est , 16 august 2013 updated : 07:41 est , 16 august 2013 battle : @entity2 , 67 , says he has been the victim of a ' relentless pursuit ' by the @entity4 in the past five years a sub-postmaster accused of stealing £ 85,000 by the @entity4 has won a five - year battle to clear his name			1
@entity2 , 67 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , has been told he will face no further action after the company said it could not enter any evidence just months before he was due to appear in a civil court case			1
police launched an investigation when it emerged there was a £ 85,426 shortfall at @entity18 in 2007 , but after four years looking into the claim , they told him he would not face criminal charges			1
mr @entity2 , who was given a certificate of valour by the @entity4 in the mid- 90s after fending off a knife - wielding robber , has always maintained the shortfall was the result of a glitch in the company 's controversial @entity28 computer system			1
it is claimed more than 100 people across the country have been the subjects of false allegations by the @entity4 as a result of a computer error			1
a campaign group , the @entity37 , run by @entity38 , of @entity39 , @entity40 , helped in mr @entity2 's fight			1
a number have registered an interest in suing the @entity4 over the false accusations			1
despite police dropping the case , lawyers acting for @entity46 pursued two charges of false accounting against mr @entity2 through the civil courts			1
but the company has said it no longer pursuing the case because it is ' not in the public interest ' and a judge has recorded not - guilty verdicts			1
mr @entity2 , a grandfather - of - three , says he is relieved but has criticised @entity4 bosses for their ' relentless pursuit ' over the past five years			1
he said : ' i 've lost nearly £ 300,000 in property , lost my home , been declared bankrupt and had my name dragged through the mud			2
i knew there was something wrong in the shop and i thought somebody was taking money but i kept it quiet for six months			2
' that 's the biggest mistake i made			0
when the @entity4 did an audit they found all this missing money and i was suspended			1
' without my salary i could n't afford to pay the staff and i could n't afford to pay the bills			0
they wanted to search my house and they went through my car			0
i said to them , ' you wo n't find £ 85,000 in there "			0
' mr @entity2 lost his wife , @entity83 , to breast cancer in 2003 at the age of 57			1
the couple had worked together since 1981 when they bought the @entity89 post office before taking control of a site on @entity92 in @entity93			0
problems : mr @entity2 always maintained the £ 85,000 shortfall was due to a computer glitch mr @entity2 said : ' because my wife was ill - they said she only had 18 months to live , but she survived for three years - we gave up the branch and moved into a new house			1
' after she died , i started working in @entity102 in @entity18 and eventually bought the site			0
' i had a three - bedroom detached house in @entity106 and a flat across the road , which i rented out			2
' when i was suspended i lost all that and i lost £ 50,000 a year in @entity4 salaries			1
all the staff i 've ever worked with in @entity111 think i stole £ 85,000			0
they 've dragged my reputation through the dirt			0
' when i was told that it was all over i was over the moon , i was absolutely elated			0
but the hardest thing is knowing that my wife and i worked for so many years , doing so much to try to make sure my family was secure			0
' mr @entity2 has now entered into a ' mediation ' period with @entity4 bosses as he wants compensation for five years of ' torture '			1
@entity125 mp @entity124 has championed mr @entity2 's fight and raised his plight in @entity128			1
last night mr @entity124 told @entity129 it was a ' scandal ' , stating : ' the way @entity132 has been treated is verging on cruel			0
' ministers must now act to ensure victims of these @entity4 allegations get the compensation they deserve			2
i have written to ministers today and will be pursuing @entity132 's case very hard			2
' backtrack : mr @entity2 was months away from appearing at @entity139 for the civil case before it was dropped last year the @entity4 instructed a firm of forensic accountants , 2nd @entity144 , to conduct an independent review of 10 existing cases raised by a number of mps and the law firm @entity149			1
about 100 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses have registered an interest in suing @entity46 over its @entity28 computer system , which records financial transactions in branches across the @entity156			2
the @entity4 has repeatedly denied there is a problem with the system , saying the claims have been made by a very small number of people			2
but mr @entity124 criticised business minister @entity163 during a parliamentary debate last month , saying a report had found there was scope for the @entity4 ' to improve aspects of its support and training for sub-postmasters '			1
a @entity46 spokeswoman said : ' @entity46 has determined that in this case it is no longer in the public interest to prosecute			2
' she added : ' @entity46 is committed to supporting its people and improving the way we do so			0
the interim review published recently by independent investigators @entity182 makes it clear that the @entity28 computer system and its supporting processes function effectively across our network			2
' as the review notes , it is used by around 68,000 people in more than 11,500 branches , successfully processing more than six million transactions every day			0
the review underlines our cause for confidence in the overall system			0
' in relation to other cases , she said : ' we would not comment on other cases			0
however , cases are only prosecuted where they meet and continue to meet the requirements of the code for crown prosecutors			0
that code requires both an evidential test and a public interest test to be applied			0
the code also requires the prosecution to keep under review whether or not that test continues to be met			0

@entity2 , from @entity9 , suspended after shortfall was discovered in 2007
@entity213 - of - three always maintained it was the result of a computer glitch
police found no evidence of criminality but @entity4 pursued civil case
@entity222 finally dropped the claim just months before case was due to begin
