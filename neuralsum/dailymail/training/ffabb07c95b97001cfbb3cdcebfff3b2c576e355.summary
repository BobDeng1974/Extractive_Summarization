@entity2 's @entity1 future is up in the air and the midfielder has a big decision to make regarding his future with the only club he 's ever played for			1
having made his @entity9 debut 16 years ago , @entity2 came on for the final 15 minutes of @entity1 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity11 having been rested by manager @entity12 , who confirmed after the game that the club have offered their captain a new contract with his current 120,000 - a - week deal ending next year			1
here , @entity18 's experts give their verdicts on whether the @entity21 legend , who turns 35 in may , should stay on @entity22 or go in search of pastures new			1
@entity1 captain @entity2 turns 35 in may and has a big decision to make regarding his @entity21 future @entity2 has spent his entire career with @entity1 having made his debut for the club 16 years ago the midfielder was rested and benched for @entity1 's @entity32 clash against @entity11 on saturday @entity1 boss @entity12 brought @entity2 on for the final fifteen minutes as the @entity9 won late on @entity2 was in relaxed mood while watching the @entity32 action at his home on sunday @entity37 - @entity36 go			1
go and get some sunshine and few bucks in the @entity40			0
@entity2 has been an ambassador , a tremendous footballer and a terrific professional			1
he is also someone who wo n’t be fully appreciated by all until he has gone			0
he did n’t win the medals like @entity45 and @entity46 and he has n’t scored as many goals as @entity48 , but he ’s my no. 1 and he should go out while he ’s still remembered ( by some ) in that way			0
i get the ‘ one club man ’ desire , but @entity55 fans do n’t think any less of @entity56 , do they ? @entity57 - stay he should stay and @entity1 simply ca n't afford to let him leave			1
even if his powers are diminishing , his presence remains vitally important			2
if that means gently moving him into a player - coach role , so be it			0
he 's too important a figure to lose			2
@entity2 has always been an important figure at @entity21 and has scored a number of vital goals for the club @entity2 netted a late leveller against @entity71 in the 2006 fa cup final as @entity1 lifted the famous trophy @entity74 - @entity36 he should go , not because he is n't needed and not because he 's not good enough , but because he has done enough at @entity1			1
he does n't have to prove himself as a one - club man			1
he 'll always be revered at @entity21 no matter what happens now			1
it 's clear @entity1 wo n't be winning the league this season and it would be extraordinary if that moment came again in his playing life , so now is a great time to seek new challenges and fresh stimuli			1
it 's regenerated @entity48 and he only went to @entity85			0
but preferably , go abroad , learn a language , enjoy a new culture and the last two years of your career with a fresh challenge			1
@entity2 , pictured celebrating against local rivals @entity91 , will always be revered at @entity21 no matter what @entity2 made his senior @entity1 debut in november 1998 , coming on as a substitute against @entity95 1980 : born may 30 , in @entity96			1
1988 : joins @entity1 academy			1
1998 : november - makes senior @entity1 debut as substitute against @entity95			1
1999 : september - one of three players sent off in bad - tempered @entity22 derby as @entity91 win 1 - 0 at @entity21			1
december - @entity103 first @entity1 goal in 4 - 1 victory over @entity105			1
2003 : september - appointed @entity1 captain			1
2004 : march - named @entity108 captain for friendly in @entity110 in the absence of @entity112 and @entity113			0
2005 : may - @entity115 trophy , scoring the first goal as @entity118 's team fight back from 3 - 0 down to win on penalties against @entity120 in @entity121			0
2006 : april - named @entity123 player of the year			0
may - @entity124 twice as @entity1 win @entity125 with defeat of @entity71			1
2008 : october - scores his 100th goal for @entity1 against @entity130			2

2010 : november - comes off the bench to score a second - half hat - trick in a 3 - 1 @entity140 win against @entity141			0
2011 : july - ruled out of the start of the new season after suffering an infection related to his groin problem			0
october - scores on his return in 1 - 1 draw against @entity150			0
2012 : february - @entity1 defeat @entity151 on penalties in @entity154 final at @entity155			2
@entity157 hat - trick for @entity1 in 3 - 0 @entity22 derby win over @entity91			2
august - celebrates 250th game as @entity1 captain			2
2013 : july 15 - @entity162 contract extension with @entity1			2
2014 : april 6 - @entity103 twice as @entity1 beat @entity71 2 - 1 to move top of the @entity32			2
april 27 - @entity1 lose 2 - 0 to @entity164 that effectively ends their @entity32 challenge			1
@entity2 celebrates winning the 2005 @entity115 with @entity1 - one of many trophies he has won @entity167 stay			1
this is heading towards being the hardest decision @entity2 has had to make			1
in his mind , the biggest point that needs answering is whether he will still be able to make a contribution next season			0
if he can answer it positively , then he has to stay			0
if he wants to try a new challenge and sample life in a different part of the world , not one person could begrudge him			0
there are still things for him to achieve and he is the iconic figure at the club			0
@entity1 would not be the same if he left			2
whatever he decides , he will be given full support			0
what @entity1 must ensure , though , is to remind him of exactly how valuable he is to them			2
@entity188 - @entity36 @entity2 has been a phenomenal player for @entity1 since his debut 16 years ago , but my fear is his legs do n’t have enough battery left in them			1
if @entity196 was still there , they would be title contenders – but now they look a few years off challenging again			0
@entity2 does n’t have the luxury of time for another slow , rebuilding project			2
@entity2 has captained @entity1 for a number of years and the club must show how valuable he is to them @entity1 featured @entity2 on the front of their programme against @entity11 to celebrate his 16 years at the club @entity205 - @entity36 it sounds unthinkable , but it 's time for @entity2 to leave @entity1			1
i saw him at @entity71 earlier in the season and he looked a shadow of the player he was			0
it might be too far fetched to say his legs have gone , but he can no longer produce those rampaging displays that made him one of @entity215 's best players in the @entity32			0
he should go to a league where the pace of the game is much slower ; @entity219 perhaps			0
he 'll be able to prolong his playing career by doing that			0
@entity222 - @entity36 @entity36 : for his own sake			0
his @entity1 career has been magnificent but a couple of years playing in the @entity227 , or @entity228 will clear his head and give him the space to think and recharge after a career under scrutiny from start to finish			1
he can consider his future and if that is to be in coaching , he can get his qualifications and return to @entity240 football ready for that			0
@entity242 stay , for now			0
the @entity40 , however , is where he should ultimately head			0
@entity2 has not become a bad player , he just is n't the brilliant force of old , and probably has n't been for a few years			1
only now is this being highlighted - on and off the pitch - in light of @entity1 's struggle			1
were he not ' @entity2 ' , his performance would not merit the scrutiny it is currently receiving			2
i saw him play at @entity252 this season , and he was @entity1 's best player			1
rather , he was let down by team - mates			0
but @entity2 should try something new , for him and his family			2
the @entity40 is an exciting place to be right now and @entity259 need a marquee player			0
the only question is , could one city accommodate @entity2 and @entity48 ... @entity2 , pictured celebrating against @entity150 last term , may follow in the footsteps of former @entity108 team - mate @entity48 and try his luck in the @entity40 stay 4 - 7 go @entity266 - @entity36 why not go abroad for his final few years and experience a different scene ? some of @entity219 ’s giants are crying out for a midfielder of his stature – the recent @entity120 derby attested to that – and his playing days would extend further than with @entity1			1
would be a fresh challenge in the twilight of his career and he could still return to @entity21 a legend in whatever capacity befits			1
@entity282 - @entity36 it ’d be a crying shame if @entity2 ’s career merely petered out at @entity21 over the next year or two			1
he owes it to himself to go and play abroad , trying to win a league title somewhere ; that could rejuvenate him			0
@entity289 is a division which is beginning to operate at a faster pace but it ’d suit the 34 - year - old			0
it ’s not as if he ’s never going to enjoy a role at @entity1 when retirement does come			2
@entity296 - stay he should stay			0
not that his legacy at @entity1 needs enhancing , but there is something endearing about a one - club player			1
besides , even if his form were awful , which it is n't , the club still owe him playing time for sticking around at his best .			0

@entity2 is a ' one club man ' having spent sixteen years at @entity1
@entity2 turns 35 in may and has a big decision to make about his future
@entity12 is keen to keep @entity2 at @entity21
@entity2 's @entity1 future remains *increasingly* *uncertain* however
@entity18 's experts give their verdict on whether @entity2 should stay at @entity1 or go in search of a new challenge
