@entity1 , 60 , was sent a demand for the meagre amount despite the fact his 86 - year - old father @entity13 died in the summer			2
@entity15 's revenue and benefits team has since apologised for the upset the bill caused but said it is legally obliged to send it			0
however , it said mr @entity1 is not expected to pay the outstanding bill			1
mr @entity1 , who is still receiving his father 's mail from his home in @entity15 , @entity24 , said council officials should use common sense			1
the demand , which includes deductions for single occupancy and benefit payments , states if a bill is less than £ 5 , then the recipient does not need to pay the balance			0
however , mr @entity1 , managing director of a construction firm , said : ' if i am being told that i can disregard the letter , then why have they sent it out and what am i supposed to do with it ? ' it just seems like a ludicrous waste of taxpayers ’ money , especially at a time when the council is looking to save cash			1
' here is the perfect example of something they could have written off , but they did n’t , they put a stamp on it and posted it			0
' if you asked the man on the street , i ’m sure they would say that it makes no sense whatsoever			0
' i know the council are probably following rules and procedures that have been laid down , but perhaps they should look at reviewing those regulations			0
' the council spokeswoman added : ' we have a legal obligation to send out the letter , but we are not expecting mr @entity1 to pay the amount			2
' the letters also help us keep track of a number of things , including changes within council tax bands			0
' waste : mr @entity1 said the council should use ' common sense ' as the 1p bill , pictured , would have cost more in postage than the outstanding amount			1

@entity1 said @entity15 must show common sense
local *authority* posted it even though they never expected him to pay
