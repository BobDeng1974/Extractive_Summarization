by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 08:13 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 08:13 est , 16 july 2013 lawyers for @entity4 filed an appeal just before a midnight deadline monday that challenges the imprisoned former @entity9 governor 's corruption conviction and 14 - year prison term , including on grounds the trial judge allegedly committed a litany of errors			1
the 100 - plus page filing with the 7th @entity17 @entity16 in @entity18 comes more than two years after the @entity18 @entity20 's retrial and 16 months after he entered a federal prison in @entity22			2
jurors convicted @entity4 , 56 , of engaging in wide - ranging corruption , including that the two - term governor sought to profit from his power to appoint someone to the @entity29 seat that @entity30 vacated to become president			1
corrupt : former @entity9 governor @entity4 attempted to sell an appointment to the @entity29 seat once held by president @entity30 @entity4 's most shocking crime in the eyes of most observers was no crime at all , the appeal contends			1
@entity4 was merely engaging in standard politics when he floated the idea of securing a @entity17 @entity43 seat or ambassadorship for himself if he appointed @entity30 confidant @entity45 to the @entity29 seat , it says			1
neither @entity30 nor @entity47 have ever been accused of any wrongdoing in the case			0
" the record shows that @entity4 's proposed exchange was an arm 's length political deal , described by @entity4 as a political ' horse trade , ' " the appeal says			1
it was n't criminal " because the political deal proposed by @entity4 was a proper and common exchange under our democratic system of government			0
" the appeal also points to what it says was a lack of evenhandedness by @entity17 district judge @entity66 throughout @entity68 's two trials			2
it alleges @entity66 gave @entity4 little choice but to testify at his retrial after repeatedly ruling arguments the defense viewed as crucial could only be broached by @entity4 himself from the witness stand			0
once on the stand , @entity66 prohibited many of those statements , including @entity4 's attempt to tell jurors he believed at the time that his actions were legal , it contends			1
14 years : former @entity9 gov. @entity4 , left , walks with attorneys as he arrives at the @entity84 in @entity22 in march 2012 to serve a 14 - year sentence " had @entity4 been permitted to present his good - faith defense , it would have been a powerful defense , likely to produce an acquittal , " his lawyers argue			2
the appeal also blames @entity66 for allowing a juror who allegedly expressed bias against @entity4 to remain on the jury despite defense attorneys ' objections			2
the appeal only referred to the panelist as juror no. 174 , saying he said about @entity4 during jury selection , " i just figured him , possibly , to be guilty			2
" the appeal also raises longstanding claims that @entity66 barred @entity103 wiretap evidence that might have aided the defense , that he sided overwhelming with prosecutors and that he miscalculated the appropriate prison term for @entity4			1
the appeal was filed about 30 minutes before midnight			0
@entity4 was convicted on 18 counts over two trials , jurors in the first deadlocking on all but one count			0
taking the stand in the second , decisive trial in 2011 , @entity4 insisted his talking about wanting to sell @entity30 's seat was just that â€” talk			1
@entity66 imposed a lengthy prison term at a sentencing hearing later in 2011 , telling @entity4 he had abused voters ' trust and undermined the democratic process " to do things that were only good for yourself			0
" @entity4 : @entity4 speaks to the media outside his home in @entity18 , as his wife @entity126 wipes away her tears a day before he was to report to prison many observers at the time said @entity4 's best hope on appeal was n't that a higher court would overturn his convictions but that appellate judges would agree his sentence was too harsh			1
appeals can take years to play out , and defendants rarely prevail			0
another @entity9 governor convicted for corruption , @entity141 , filed multiple appeals over years and lost every key ruling			1
the former @entity145 leader was recently released after more than five years in prison and seven months of home confinement			0
secret wiretaps of an often foul - mouthed @entity4 eager to earn big money were at the core of prosecutors ' case			0
" i 've got this thing and it 's f --- --- golden , " jurors heard @entity4 saying in one wiretapped conversation about @entity30 's vacated seat			1
" and i 'm just not giving it up for f --- --- nothing			0
" as inmate no. 40892 - 424 in the @entity84 in suburban @entity161 , @entity4 's life is highly regimented , including frequent head counts and having to wake at dawn			2
' @entity164 ' : @entity4 wanted to appoint @entity30 adviser @entity45 to the @entity29 in exchange for an ambassadorship for himself in a @entity168 posting this year , @entity4 's wife , @entity126 , said her husband is spending time in prison teaching @entity172 history and learning to play the guitar			1
she added that he frequently jogs around a quarter - mile prison track			0
" all that we have been left with is a aching hole in our lives , " she added about herself and the couple 's two daughters			0
after the then - governor 's dec. 9 , 2008 arrest , @entity4 hit the talk show circuit to declare his innocence and to rail against prosecutors			2
he even appeared on @entity187 's reality show , " @entity188			0

@entity4 claims his prison sentence is too harsh
the former governor was convicted on corruption charges after floating the idea of securing a @entity17 @entity43 seat or ambassadorship for himself if he appointed @entity30 confidant @entity45 to the @entity29 seat
@entity4 's appeal is unlikely to be *successful* , *experts* say
