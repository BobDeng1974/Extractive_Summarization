this was one of the most poignant moments in modern history			2
on a bleak january day in 1965 , the cranes along the @entity5 dipped as the launch carrying @entity8 ’s body passed the giant metal structures on the wharves on its journey from @entity13			1
commentating for the @entity15 , @entity14 described the scene			2
‘ across the river , even the jibs of the cranes of @entity20 ’s @entity19 are being lowered in a final salute , unique , strangely touching , as they bow forward towards the other side of the river where the coffin is going away on its launch upstream			1
’ @entity8 ’s grandson and now a @entity29 mp , @entity28 , was in the family party aboard the launch			1
he recalled the spectacle of the dipping arms of the cranes , saying it ‘ undid us all ’			1
however , it has now been claimed workers had to be paid to do it due to their anti-churchill sentiments the @entity44 reported : ‘ for a week , every detail of the procession arrangements had been written about			1
and so it was that one gesture , with the added element of surprise , held for many watchers the strongest jolt to unbraced emotions			2
‘ as the launch carrying the coffin moved upstream , the jibs of cranes dipped in ragged salute			1
@entity59 ’s dockers , the last men usually associated with sentimental gestures , expressed their feelings for one who also had a reputation for tough , uncompromising directness			2
’ but in wednesday night ’s @entity67 documentary , @entity8 : the @entity68 , a docker cast doubt on the spontaneity of the occasion by claiming the workers had to be paid			1
@entity74 , who was working in 1965 , said : ‘ they [ the dockers ] did n’t like @entity8			1
i think i can speak for most , they did n’t like him			0
when they were asked to do it , the atmosphere was “ no ”			0
they were paid to do it			1
we did n’t work saturday afternoon [ the day of the funeral ] , we would n’t have been there			1
‘ there was a lot of arguments and rows about it			0
the atmosphere was that @entity8 was n’t a working class person			1
you ’d see him with a cigar in one hand and sometimes a drink in the other , he just did n’t associate with us at all			0
’ @entity97 , who presented the programme , said he watched the funeral as a schoolboy on television			1
he said he was conscious of the comment of his mother ( who had driven ambulances in the war ) about @entity8 : ‘ we were so lucky to have him , you know			1
’ he added : ‘ as a child i did n’t question the ritual that marked his death			0
’ but although the lowering of the cranes was universally seen as a ‘ spontaneous bowing in respect ’ by dockers in recognition of the great man ’s role in saving the country from @entity120 tyranny , @entity97 said it ‘ was n’t anything of the kind ’			2
the flag - draped coffin of @entity8 on board the @entity126 during his funeral in 1965 this revelation is a reminder of one of the most shameful aspects of both @entity132 and @entity133 : the disgraceful lack of patriotism of many in the @entity138 movement			1
indeed , even in 1965 , there were trades unionists who considered @entity8 as a class enemy			1
some of that hatred dated back to 1910 , when @entity8 was home secretary and he sent troops into @entity145 to control striking miners			1
for many trades unionists , the two world wars offered the perfect opportunity to blackmail their employers and the government into giving them better terms and conditions of service , and for expanding union power , with the threat that the country would suffer if the government and their employers did n’t give in			0
all too often the government did surrender , or pressured private sector employers to do so			0
this cave - in was partly down to @entity8 ’s minister of labour , @entity165 , who insisted that — with the @entity168 about to put their jackboot on @entity171 ’s throat — there must not be a repeat of the havoc wrought during the @entity132 by militant strikers			1
indeed , the @entity176 has a shameful history of unpatriotic and self - interested behaviour during war - time and which was often directed at our war leaders			0
at the height of @entity132 , in february 1915 , workers in munitions factories on the @entity184 had walked out , with industrial unrest spreading to factories in @entity188 and @entity189			1
later in the year , 15,000 @entity184 shipyard workers went on strike again in protest at the compulsory deduction of rent arrears from their pay packets			2
then , in 1917 , 200,000 workers in 48 different towns walked out , mainly over wages , but also over food prices , exemptions from military service and what they termed ‘ war profiteering ’			2
even in 1965 there were trade unionists who considered @entity8 ( pictured ) a class enemy and so when war came in again in 1939 , the many @entity209 in the @entity138 movement felt no urge to support the war effort			1
their views were articulated by the late @entity216 historian @entity215 , a friend of @entity218 ’s father @entity217 , and then a naïve 22 - year - old , that since there was a non-aggression pact between @entity223 and their hero , @entity226 , it was wrong to attack @entity120			0
meanwhile , rising to prominence in the union movement at the time was @entity230 , who went on , as @entity231 and general workers ’ union leader , to lead his members out on a series of strikes and who was , after his death , exposed as a paid agent for the @entity239			1
in 1939 , he became a full - time union organiser in the car factories of the @entity242 which were being used for the full - time production of tanks , planes and armoured vehicles			0
although @entity230 had been a @entity247 soldier , he was a fervent communist and fought in the @entity249			0
while men were dying for their country , @entity230 was establishing a @entity248 - approved organisation of shop stewards in the factories of his @entity242 bailiwick			0
pathetically , the bosses rolled over and allowed the unions to establish enormous power in their factories — which would linger on after the war and , by the @entity261 , effectively kill the @entity171 car industry			2
@entity209 went further — and refused to abstain from strike action until 1941 and the @entity120 invasion of @entity265 and their beloved @entity226			0
even though strikes had been made illegal in wartime , there were at least 900 in the first few months of the war			0
in may 1940 , as @entity223 launched his attack on the @entity272 and @entity273 , the @entity274 — the newspaper of organised @entity209 in @entity171 — described the war effort as ‘ the @entity277 ’			2
much of the @entity279 union movement , believing their employers were getting enormously rich on the back of the huge armaments programme , saw more and more reason to strike to try to get a bigger share of the money			0
in truth , however , their employers were having to pay massively increased income tax , corporation tax and taxes on dividends to help finance the war , so the idea of them profiteering was largely illusory			0
that did n’t stop local union organisers demanding more			0
during the rest of the war , there were strikes all across the country — in engineering factories , the coal mines , aircraft manufacturers , shipyards , and by bus drivers and conductors			0
in 1943 , workers at a factory in @entity59 making tail - fins for @entity313 bombers went on strike and more than 16,000 women and some men walked out of the @entity318 factory in @entity319 — where they should have been making engines for fighter planes			2
a key area of industrial unrest during the @entity133 was centered around the docks			1
pictured here are strikers at @entity327 in 1945 another key area of industrial unrest was the docks			2
in december 1943 , 1,000 dockers went on strike in @entity332 and 1944 was considered to be an annus horribilis in terms of strike action , with lightning walk - outs in many ports at full stretch preparing for the invasion of @entity340			0
there were strikes at docks in the west of @entity345 , including @entity346 , in january , over the suspension of 11 men who refused to move to another port and work for less pay			0
no interest was too selfish to put before the good of the country			0
and so , it was against this background that the behaviour of the @entity59 dockers on january 30 , 1965 , should be seen and the revelation that they had to be be given money to pay @entity8 tribute			1
to be fair , many trades unionists were disgusted by the way some of their number behaved during the war , and many unions disowned the unpatriotic extremism of some of their brethren			0
but when one realises the full extent of union militancy in @entity171 ’s darkest hour , bolshy @entity59 dockers demanding money to show respect to the great leader who took the country through that grave ordeal is , i ’m afraid , all too plausible .			0

dipping of cranes during @entity8 *'s* funeral a moment remembered by all
but the crane operators had to be paid due to @entity389 sentiment
it was *unsurprising* given the lack of patriotism shown by striking workers
there was plenty of industry unrest during the @entity133 effort
