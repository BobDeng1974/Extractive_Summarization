for most viewers , the last time they saw @entity2 on television , he was smartly dressed , calmly relaying the world ’s news			1
so they can be forgiven their shock at seeing the 68 - year - old ’s return to the screen last night on i ’m a celebrity … @entity13			0
face aghast and stretched by the wind , the 30 - year veteran of @entity15 looked anything but composed as he skydived from a helicopter			1
