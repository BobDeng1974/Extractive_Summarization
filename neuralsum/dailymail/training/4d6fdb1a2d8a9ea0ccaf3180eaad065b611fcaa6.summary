@entity1 is set to launch a giant @entity2 called the @entity3 this year to take on the rising challenge from @entity6 's surface and @entity8 tablets , it has been claimed			1
the firm is also hoping the larger screen will help it differentiate the @entity2 from the big screen @entity11			1
the big screen tablet is believed to be planned for release towards the end of the year			1
@entity18 , an analyst at market researcher @entity19 , said the pans were already well advanced			1
' our supply side ( sources say ) it 's a go for 2015 , ' @entity21 told @entity27			1
' the release timing is fuzzy , it may not appear until @entity29 ( fourth quarter ) with the other @entity2 updates			2
' we are , however , getting input from both the component and [ product ] side that this is a real product , and part of their 2015 building plan			2
' @entity1 ceo @entity40 , in the company 's most recent earnings conference call in january , talked about the @entity2 's future			2
' over the long arc of time the @entity2 is a great business , ' he said			2
' i also have visibility obviously of what 's in the pipeline and feel very , very good about that			2
' earlier this month a pose on @entity50 networking site @entity49 leaked what it claimed were the specs for the device			1
apparently , the tablet will feature a 12.9 - inch display with @entity56 , and a 7mm thin profile			2
the leak also said the tablet is supposed to weigh 700g and pack a large 11,000 mah battery , significantly bigger than the @entity62 's 7,340 mah battery			2
the tablet is also expected to have four speakers , and could even features two charging ports allowing it to remain plugged in when in either portrait of landscape mode			2
late last year a leaked design for a case revealed more details of @entity1 's much rumoured @entity2 tablet			1
according to @entity75 blog nowhereelse.fr , the case is from a ' reliable source ' which has previously given them advance details of @entity1 's product , which the firm is notoriously secretive about			2
it ' would be equipped with a screen measuring from 12.2 to 12.9 inches diagonally , ' it says			2
the tablet is also expected to have four speakers , and could even featur two charging ports allowing it to remain plugged in when in either portrait of landscape mode			2
it comes weeks after an image was leaked that appeared to be a mould for the device			1
the photo was reportedly taken at @entity1 manufacturer @entity94 's factory in @entity50 and is said to measure approximately 12 inches high by 8.7 inches wide			2
it follows a leaked sketch from last week that claimed to show one corner of the so - called megapad , @entity99 or @entity100			1
the photo of the mould ( pictured ) was reportedly taken at @entity1 manufacturer @entity94 's factory in @entity50			1
experts have estimated that the mould would produce a tablet that measures 12 inches in height , 8.7 inches wide and 0.27 inches deep ( 305.3mm x 220.8 mm x 7mm )			1
the latest image was posted on @entity50 social network @entity49			2
if the rumours are true , the @entity99 would be significantly larger than the current @entity110 2			1
experts have estimated that the mould would produce a tablet that measures 12 inches in height , 8.7 inches wide and 0.27 inches deep ( 305.3mm x 220.8 mm x 7mm )			1
by comparison , the @entity115 is 9.4 inches by 6.7 inches by 0.24 inches ( 240mm x 169.5mm x 6.1mm )			0
name : popular suggestions for the name of the supersized tablet include the @entity100 - taking its lead from @entity1 's @entity11 smartphone , and the @entity123 size : the tablet is rumoured to have a 12.2 inch screen , although other dimensions have also been suggested			0
rumours suggest it will be just 7mm thick			0
design : the leaked ' sketch ' suggests that the @entity100 will be similar in design to the @entity110 2 , with its rounded corners and also share the same placement of buttons on its edges			1
@entity137 : the image differs from the smaller tablet however , because of grilles on the top of the shell , which suggest the device will include stereo speakers , as rumoured			0
launch : sources have suggested different launch times , but there is some consensus that the tablet may make its debut before the summer			0
the @entity62 has a 9.7 - inch display , while the @entity99 is rumoured to have a 12.2 - inch screen			0
this would put the @entity155 on par with @entity158 's 12.2 - inch @entity157 , which launched in february			0
last week 's leaked sketch , also reportedly taken by an employee who works at @entity94 seemed to show a grille that will also boast four speakers for stereo sound			1
the image was released by @entity75 website @entity165 , which has previously leaked details from unannounced smartphones and @entity1 gadgets which proved to be true , citing a @entity94 source			1
the source said that initial testing for the @entity100 was stopped in the summer and @entity1 's suppliers will soon start mass production of the tablet			0
the sketch suggests that the tablet will look similar to the @entity110 2 in design , with rounded corners and the same standby button , rear camera , microphone and volume buttons placement			1
however , seemingly confirming rumours that the larger tablet will offer stereo sound , there appears to be a speaker grill on the top of the shell			0
@entity193 magazine @entity191 claimed in december that the @entity100 will also feature a much faster a9 processor and is set to launch between april and june			0
by comparison , the @entity110 2 ( pictured ) is 9.4 inches x 6.7 inches by 0.24 inches ( 240 mm x 169.5 mm x 6.1 mm )			1
sources have suggested different launch times for the @entity100 , but the general consensus is that the supersized tablet may make its debut before the summer a leaked photo of a sketch ( pictured ) reportedly taken by an employee who works in a @entity94 factory , where @entity2 are made , also suggests that the rumours of an ' @entity100 ' with a 12.2 inch screen , are true @entity207 and other publications reported that @entity1 was planning on releasing the device sometime in early 2015 , while a recent report from @entity211 said the @entity213 firm had postponed mass production of the larger ipad from december 2014 into next year as suppliers struggled to meet demand for the @entity11 and 6 @entity3 launch			1
these designs showed the gadget as just 7mm thick , but the size of the screen is uncertain , with rumours suggesting measurements between 12 inches and 12.9 inches			0
the first suggestion of a supersized tablet came just weeks after claims that the large screen size of the @entity11 was impacting on @entity2 usage			0
the release of @entity1 's @entity231 means there is now only a 2.4 - inch difference between the size of the phablet 's screen , and the display on its ipad mini			0
analysis has revealed that as phones become larger , more people are using them for watching videos or reading - making their tablets almost redundant			1
the @entity110 2 has a 9.7 - inch display , while the @entity99 is rumoured to have a 12.2 - inch @entity245 would put the @entity155 on par with @entity158 's @entity157 , which launched last february ( pictured ) the @entity100 is expected to have a 12.2inch screen or even larger , dwarfing the @entity248 with its 7.9inch screen ( left ) and @entity110 ( right ) with a 9.7 inch screen a study by @entity251 - an app that lets users save webpages , videos and other content for reading - recently found that people who upgraded to an @entity11 6 plus use their tablets 36 per cent less than before			1
it analysed more than two million articles and videos that were opened using the app , and compared the before and after behaviour in people who previously owned an @entity11 5 , @entity265 and @entity266 and those who now own an @entity268			0
it also looked at the use of tablets by the same people			0
a survey comparing the before - and - after behaviour of @entity11 and @entity2 users revealed that people with an @entity266 use their phone 55 % of the time , but this increases to 72 % for the @entity11 and 80 % for the @entity11 - both at the detriment of the @entity2 , perhaps explaining why @entity280 is planning a larger one @entity251 also saw users with both an @entity11 and an @entity2 watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an @entity283			1
those with the @entity11 ( centre ) opened 33 % more articles and videos inside @entity251 than they did with a @entity266 ( left ) , and those with a @entity288 ( right ) opened 65 % more items than before the @entity11 6 accounted for 68 per cent of all sales through september and into early october , while its larger model took between 23 and 24 per cent			0
@entity1 's cheaper @entity266 and 5c handsets made up the rest of the sales			0
following last year 's launch , the @entity266 and @entity265 accounted for 84 per cent of total @entity11 sales in the first 30 days - proving the 6 range is more popular			0
the skew is being blamed on reports that stocks of the @entity11 are lower because @entity1 is struggling to complete orders			0
recent figures from @entity251 also found that two - and - a - half more @entity251 users are opting for an @entity11 as opposed to a 6 @entity3			1
' the bigger your phone 's screen , the more time you 'll spend reading and watching on it , ' explained the researchers in a blog post			0
' in fact , the bigger your phone 's screen , the more you 'll read and watch as a whole			0
' it discovered that users who upgraded to an @entity11 6 now view content on their phones 72 per cent of the time , up from 55 per cent when they owned on a smaller screen			0
@entity251 also saw that users with both an @entity11 and an @entity2 watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an @entity283			0
but , a larger screen does make the smartphone less portable and @entity251 noticed that people with an @entity11 read 22 per cent less on their morning commutes than those with a smaller model			0
recent figures from @entity251 also found that two - and - a - half more @entity251 users are opting for an @entity11 as opposed to a 6 @entity3			1
' this tells us that , at least for now , convenience and portability trump a better , and bigger , entertainment and reading experience			0
