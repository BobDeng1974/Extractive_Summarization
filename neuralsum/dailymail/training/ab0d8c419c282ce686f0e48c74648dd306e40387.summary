by mail online reporter published : 01:48 est , 21 january 2014 updated : 01:50 est , 21 january 2014 a public protest about paying employees penalty rates on public holiday by an @entity6 pub restaurant has attracted a torrent of negative feedback with punters taking to @entity10 to vent their fury			1
the @entity12 in @entity13 put up a sign outside its doors complaining they have to pay 2.75 per cent above the ordinary hourly rate of pay on public holidays , reported @entity20			1
they multiplied everything on the menu 2.75 times in an attempt to highlight the ' stupidity of the new rate			0
@entity28 up : @entity6 's @entity12 put up a sign complaining about paying penalty rates ' the bread would be $ 19.25 under the cafe 's calculations , while lamb korma was $ 65 , salt and pepper squid $ 55 , chicken schnitzel $ 48.50 and it would be more than $ 60 for a seafood pizza , ' the sign read			1
after getting negative feedback in person , the restaurant turned to @entity10 to further explain its stance on penalty rates			1
its post claimed the increased penalty rates left employees worse off in some cases and would force venues to stay closed on public holidays , as was the case in @entity51			2
backlash : many people said that the pub was being unreasonable and should be willing to pay their workers the required rate ' so , by all means do n't come back , and by all means complain about us pointing out the stupidity of a rate 2.75 times the norm but please do n't insinuate disrespect by us to our employees , ' it explained on facebook.the message prompted a further backlash , attracting more than 300 comments , many of them critical			2
' @entity69 reminds us what we loved about slavery , ' wrote one person			0
' here 's a quick maths formula			0
multiply zero ( which equals the amount i will now spend at your establishment ) by 2.75 and see what it equals , ' wrote another			0
' interesting to see that wages make up 100 per cent of your costs			0
while it must suck to have to compensate people for working when everyone else gets a holiday , it must be nice not to have to pay for rent , insurance , or food , ' wrote @entity92 angry post declared , ' pay penalty rates you bourgeois swine ! ' ' i will never be returning			0
how dare you treat your staff like they do n't deserve decent wages and conditions , ' @entity97 wrote			0
a handful of comments defended the business ' right to highlight an issue later the @entity69 returned to its @entity10 page to apologise and later took down its sign from the front of the restaurant			1
it claimed to regret the wording it used and that it did n't mean to cause offence			0
your " opinion " has already spread across @entity10 and beyond			1
not going to be good for business , ' one @entity10 user wrote while another concluded , ' damage has been done			1
' the sign : @entity12 later removed this notice because it had caused such controversy			2
