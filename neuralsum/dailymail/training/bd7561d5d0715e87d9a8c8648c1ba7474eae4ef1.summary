concerned : the princess royal has spoken out the princess royal is demanding a crackdown on the transport of live horses from @entity5 to @entity7 slaughterhouses – fearing the illegal trade is causing unnecessary suffering to hundreds of animals every week			1
unscrupulous dealers are getting around the ban on exporting live horses for slaughter by claiming the animals are being sent to the @entity15 as pets or for work or riding , when in fact they are destined for dinner plates			1
some horses change hands several times and often endure horrific four - day journeys in trucks before slaughter in an @entity28 or @entity29 abattoir			1
princess @entity30 , president of @entity31 , called for greater checks at ports and a national database to protect vulnerable horses			1
she said : ‘ there should be a clear understanding that horses do n’t travel live to slaughter from the @entity5 overseas and that is something we should be able to maintain and stand by			0
’ the charity has found dealers flouting the rules because there are no routine checks on lorries transporting horses from @entity5 ports			2
princess @entity30 suggested that many owners who have sold a beloved horse believing it would become a cherished pet could find that the animal had instead been sold for its meat			1
‘ i suspect there are a lot of innocent victims who think they are selling their horses appropriately ... but they are going to market where slaughter buyers do attend , ’ she said			0
thousands of horses are sold as meat throughout @entity7			0
the trade came under scrutiny last year when horsemeat was found in burgers and lasagnes sold as beef in @entity5 stores			0
if horses are to be sold for meat , @entity31 argues that they should be slaughtered in @entity5 abattoir to prevent them suffering lengthy journeys			1
princess @entity30 , a former @entity5 eventing champion , said : ‘ i really hope eventually that technology will make a difference			1
if we had a better form of identification it would give confidence to owners and dealers alike that they know where their horses were going			2
