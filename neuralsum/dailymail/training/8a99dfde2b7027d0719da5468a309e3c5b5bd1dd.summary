by @entity0 published : 15:09 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 15:10 est , 6 november 2013 after years of recession , growing unemployment and swingeing spending cuts , it is little wonder that some @entity6 are at the end of their tether with their country 's fiscal state			1
and some have found a novel way of venting their frustration - writing angry messages on banknotes			2
several hit out at the @entity6 prime minister @entity16 while some are aimed at the country 's bankers			1
anger : politicians and bankers are a ' disgrace to the nation ' according to this five @entity26 note not happy : the emotive scrawling on this note accuses trade unions in @entity6 of being ' spongers ' one of the messages , written on a 10 @entity26 note says : ' this money has been laundered , please do n't circulate			1
' one angry @entity34 defaces a five @entity26 note , writing : ' politicians and bankers are a disgrace to the nation			1
' while another takes his anger out on trade unions , labeling them ' spongers '			0
in perhaps the shortest outburst , one person has scrawled across a five @entity46 is rubbish '			0
most of the messages are short and concise			0
but others are more of a rant			0
defaced : ' this banknote is laundered , please do not circulate ' writes this angry @entity34 one @entity34 chose a 50 @entity26 note to write a scathing message to bankers			2
it translates : ' politicians and bankers , as i know full well this note will end up in your hands , i wanted to take the chance to send you a private message			2
' politicians and bankers are a disgrace to the nation			1
' message on a @entity6 banknote ' you 're a bunch of thieving sons of b * * * * * * ! i invite all of you to leave a private message to them as i 'm sure it will reach them			2
' one @entity34 describes politicians and bankers as ' a disgrace to the nation			1
' it is little wonder that many @entity6 are uptight about the state of the country 's finances			0
despite news last month that the country had finally exited recession with a 0.1 per cent economic growth , unemployment is still painfully high			1
economists warned that the road to recovery will be long and tough for the @entity93 's fourth biggest economy , with around 26 per cent of the adult population still without a job			0
personal : this note sends a rather abusive message to @entity6 prime minister @entity16 unemployment is expected to remain exceptionally high for at least another five years			1
and @entity100 is unlikely to be a season of much goodwill in spain - spending during the holiday season is expected to fall by around 11.5 per cent this year , according to the @entity104 of @entity106 users and consumers			0
@entity100 spending is down a staggering 71 per cent since the market crash in 2008 , with @entity6 spending more than a third less on toys for youngsters since			2
despite the drop , @entity100 spending in @entity6 can still be seen as relatively high when compared to other countries			0
@entity6 had been shelling out around 813 euros ( Â£ 696 ) per person - more than @entity115 spent .			0

@entity6 said it exited its second recession since 2008 only last week
