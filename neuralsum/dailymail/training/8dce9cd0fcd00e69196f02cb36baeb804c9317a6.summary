the @entity0 , now under fire for its sloppy handling of ebola virus cases in the @entity4 , spent time and resources in 2011 to educate @entity4 about the epidemic threat posed by a zombie apocalypse			1
' if you 're ready for a @entity10 , you 're ready for any emergency , ' read one @entity0 internet graphic designed to be spread – virally – on social media			1
the campaign , complete with a gorey 36 - page graphic novella called ' @entity16 : @entity19 ' , ' a ' @entity17 ' and slick horror - movie posters , drew applause from fans of the @entity23 series ' @entity24 , ' but eye - rolls from most everyone else			1
' i know it was " cool " back then , ' one tweet sent thursday read , ' but in retrospect , maybe the time and effort put into the @entity0 's @entity45 was poorly spent			1
' but the @entity48 administration 's @entity0 was deadly serious about using the brain - eating undead as a proxy for real crises , telling people to put together emergency kits just in case			2
' if you are generally well equipped to deal with a zombie apocalypse , you will be prepared for a hurricane , pandemic , earthquake , or terrorist attack , ' said then - assistant surgeon general dr. @entity61			0
at the time , he was in charge of the @entity0 's @entity63			2
dr. @entity64 , the @entity0 's director , was in charge of the agency in 2011			1
he took the job at the beginning of the @entity48 administration			0
@entity64 has come under fire for fumbling the first three @entity39 cases diagnosed on @entity4 soil , including one where the agency told a nurse with direct exposure to an ebola patient that she could get on a commercial aircraft			1
as serious a topic as @entity39 is , the @entity0 was trying to latch on to pop culture with its zombie stunt			1
' there are all kinds of emergencies out there that we can prepare for , ' the agency 's @entity45 website , which is still online , reads			1
' take a zombie apocalypse for example			0
that ’s right , i said z - o - m - b - i - e a-p - o - c - a - l - y - p - s - e. you may laugh now , but when it happens you ’ll be happy you read this , and hey , maybe you ’ll even learn a thing or two about how to prepare for a real emergency			1
' reactions from web surfers were mixed			0
' this might just actually spur me to make that emergency kid ( sic ) , ' one wrote			0
' @entity0 , you are made of awesome			2
' the writer quickly amended those words : ' guess i ’ll stick to making an emergency kit , since i ’ve already made the emergency kid			0
' the @entity0 's social media campaign helped urge @entity4 to prepare for zombies , suggesting that preparing for the undead would be no harder than preparing for @entity39 @entity109 : in the 2013 movie , zombies feed on humans and turn their victims into still more zombies @entity114 was a hotbed of zombie speculation on thursday with manyn users nonplussed at the @entity0 's use of time and resources three years ago others were unimpressed , including an @entity122 , self - described as ' a huge zombie fan , and well prepared for disaster			1
' ' in a time when the @entity128 has a $ 14.3 trillion debt , and can not control spending , ' that reader 's message read , ' can you please post exactly how much government employee and / or contractor time was used to create this entertaining but wasteful page ( including planning and approval ) , and how much it costs us ( the taxpayer ) in it services and support on expensive , secured government equipment to maintain such pages on a annual basis ? ' ' it ’s not that i do n’t think that you did a great jobs ( sic ) , and i thank you for the laughs			2
i just want to know how much these moments cost us			0
' another remarked that ' the only thing more disturbing than the @entity0 posting this nonsense is the number of people who seem glad that they did			2
' the @entity154 commissioned a case study based on the campaign , collecting responses from government , authors and other opinion shapers			0
one news anchor at @entity162 in @entity163 , the report related , ' dismissed her station ’s report on the campaign by saying on air , " this is baloney "			2
' ' @entity170 host @entity169 called it one of the " dumbest things of the week			0
" and an editorial in a small @entity175 newspaper commented : " we believe @entity61 's time and our tax dollars could have been better spent providing instructions to readers on how to prepare for a real outbreak or hurricane or tornado			0
" @entity24 : so far , @entity0 director @entity64 has n't had to deal with any actual cases of zombie sickness @entity186 in @entity187 , however , praised the initiative			1
' what 's so great about this effort , ' an editorial in that paper read , ' is that it cost the @entity0 all of $ 87 for a stock photo , and some staff time , rather than the millions spent on public information programs that nobody pays attention to			1
' the cost of that staff time was never reported , nor was the cost of commissioning the graphic novella , nor the opportunity cost related to putting genuine crises on the back - burner			1
casting corpses that dine on brains as government disease antagonists , one conservative @entity206 campaign consultant told @entity210 , is full of irony			0
' this is something the @entity48 administration can do without fear that it would blow back on them , ' the operative said			0
' the last time there were any brains in that building , @entity217 was president			0
so if the zombies did come , the @entity221 would n't look too appetizing			0
' @entity0 zombie graphic novel uploaded by @entity210			2

@entity0 spent staff time organizing a ' @entity45 ' website and creating a graphic novella
' that ’s right , ' a @entity0 website read . ' i said z - o - m - b - i - e a-p - o - c - a - l - y - p - s - e. you may laugh now , but when it happens you ’ll be happy you read this '
@entity64 , the *embattled* @entity0 director , helmed the agency in 2011 when the campaign went – ahem – viral
@entity64 is the subject of several *resignation* demands since his agency fumbled the first three @entity39 cases diagnosed on @entity4 soil
