exiting the venerable studios to the strobing of photographers flashes , @entity11 stands outside as the crowd of people begins to grow			2

a gaggle of giggling teenagers are asked what they think of him : ' @entity121 , i love him , ' said one girl , while another openly screams out ' can i just say that he 's beautiful			0
' the video opens with @entity11 walking around @entity3 in just a t - shirt and shorts looking every inch a normal person			1
' my whole life , i 've always wondered what it would be like to be famous , ' explains @entity11 in a voiceover			2
one man ( left ) feels special to have seen the ' movie star ' @entity11 - while another ( right ) believes that he has heard the student 's latest single the adulation begins to overwhelm @entity11 as his bodyguards take charge of the situation with his team of 15 hired hands , @entity11 experienced first hand the adulation and attention that @entity146 and @entity147 deal with on a daily basis			1
' i had photographers follow me around and act as paparazzi , ' said @entity11			2
' there were 15 people in total that were actually in on it			2
no planted fans or anything like that			0
everything you see in the video is completely real			0
' i had to pretend like all of this was normal			0
that was one of the hardest parts			0
' and plus smiling for all those pictures , i took around 300 pictures			0
' some people kept coming up to me again and again			0
my face really hurt by the end of it			0
i thought my face was going to freeze in that smile			0
' spending three hours in @entity3 , @entity11 became nervous that the large crowd of people who had gathered to see the commotion would attract the attention of the @entity178			1
eventually after three hours , @entity11 ends his experiment - leaving behind his entourage and team to become just another average person ' we were nervous police would get involved because why would a celebrity just walk through @entity3 like that ? ' said @entity11			1
' two cops walked up to me and i was so nervous , but they just asked if they could take a picture			0
' eventually though , @entity11 decided that his social experiment had gone far enough			1
despite not one person in his team actually saying that he was famous , @entity11 felt it was time to give them the slip			1
' it was really hard to end the shoot			0
how the hell do you stop when there â€™s so many people following you ? ' said @entity11			2
' we actually had to walk away from @entity3 and into a small hotel			2
earlier in the day , @entity11 had scouted out @entity3 to see how his prank might play out ' one of my bouncers blocked off the door to the bar to keep the public from going in			1
' it was the only way we were able to stop it			0
' and now ironically , @entity11 is himself a little famous because of his stunt , but was modest when asked about the hordes of women who lavished him with attention that night			1
' no , i have a girlfriend			0
i am very loyal , ' said @entity11 .			0

student @entity11 's 15 - minutes of fame was intending to be a social experiment into the public 's fascination with celebrity
spent three hours in @entity4 's @entity3 taking three hundred pictures with members of the public who believed that he was a famous actor or singer
never once told people he was famous - only *relied* on his team to keep saying his name
ironically the @entity4 student is now experiencing slight fame because of his stunt
