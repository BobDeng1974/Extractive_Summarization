the image below may look like a modern art sculpture but this jumble of metallic shapes is actually a bike frame in the making			2
the two @entity7 firms behind the innovative framework claim they have created the first @entity11 printed metal bike frame			1
made of titanium alloy , the frame is fresh out of a 3d printer and has been designed to be as light and strong as possible - but the parts still need to be stuck together by hand			1
made of titanium alloy , the frame ( pictured ) is fresh out of a 3d printer and has been designed to be as light and strong as possible - but the parts still need to be stuck together by hand to form a recognisable bicycle frame the project is a collaboration between @entity24 – the @entity7 ’s only 3d printing manufacturer using metal parts - and bicycle design company @entity27 , in the north west of @entity29			1
based on @entity27 ’s @entity31 mountain bike , the frame is printed in titanium alloy and has a tensile strength of over @entity34			1
based on @entity27 's @entity31 mountain bike , the frame is printed in titanium alloy and has a tensile strength of over @entity37			1
it is pictured as part of the @entity27 bike model the frame was designed using topological optimisation , - software to distribute material in the smartest way possible ( illustrated ) the new frame is hollow with internal strengthening features and is a third lighter than the original			1
it was designed using ‘ topological optimisation , ’ which means using software to distribute material in the smartest way possible			2
‘ material is removed from areas of low stress until a design optimised for load bearing is evolved , ’ @entity24 said , so that unneeded material can be eliminated and the bike made lighter			2
the frame , which when printed is joined to a metal plate , was broken up and bonded together			0
the companies said this allows for flexible design improvements and the process means that a frame can be tailored to an individual ’s exact needs			0
the bike is not yet on sale and is currently being put through its paces by researchers at @entity70 , who are using strain gauges to measure its performance both in the lab and on mountains			0
while in its infancy for metal bike frames , there could come a day when bicycle enthusiasts could easily print out their own frames and other parts to build a bespoke @entity11 printed bike			0
the new @entity11 printed frame is hollow with internal strengthening features and a third lighter than the original ( pictured ) made by @entity27 the process was used to determine the most efficient use of titanium for the 3d printed bike frame			1
the word comes from the @entity92 word for place – topo - and topological optimisation software is the term given to programs that are used to determine the ‘ logical place ’ for material			0
it normally involves using iterative steps and element analysis			0
material is removed from areas of low stress until a design optimised for load bearing is evolved			0
the resulting model is both light ( due to the low volume of material used ) and strong			0
the two firms worked together on the bike from to design a shape made for additive manufacturing - eliminating many of the downward facing surfaces that would otherwise have needed wasteful support structures .			2

@entity7 firms @entity24 and @entity27 cycles designed the titanium alloy frame based on @entity27 's @entity31 mountain bike
they used software to distribute titanium alloy in the smartest way possible
the new frame is hollow with internal strengthening features and is a third lighter than the original
