@entity0 and @entity1 were able to take a @entity3 early cut against @entity4 after scoring in a 3 - 1 win against the @entity7 champions			1
with saturday ’s game looming large and @entity10 still with @entity11 and the tail - end of hurricane @entity13 to contend with , @entity8 took full advantage of playing the night before by taking off their two superstars midway through the second - half			1
it nearly back - fired in the closing stages as @entity4 scrambled a late goal but a point would have been more than they deserved after the home side dominated the 90 minutes			1

on a night of goals galore in the @entity38 the only surprise was that @entity8 had not put more distance between themselves and @entity4 before @entity0 and @entity1 were taken off , especially having opened their account so soon			1
they have had problems scoring early this season but they carved @entity4 open on eight minutes when @entity62 fed @entity0 who released @entity1 before the @entity99 found the far corner of @entity28 ’s goal			1
it was his sixth goal for club and country in a week			0
@entity0 could have doubled the lead on 11 minutes but shot over from the edge of the area			2
@entity4 were open at the back and @entity8 were bright going forward , especially @entity62 who was finally looking like a player who does not want to step aside and allow @entity110 to take his place			2
after a poor start to the season though , he may have left it late to stake that particular claim			0
@entity0 got the second on 25 minutes - running on to @entity33 ’s threaded pass			2
@entity28 got his hand to the shot but could not stop it crossing his line			0
it was his 69th goal in 89 @entity38 games and it moved him to within two of @entity124 whose record breaking haul of 71 came in 144 games			2
the race to catch @entity124 could now be won by @entity128 who is also on 69 goals ahead of wednesday ’s game at @entity131			0
@entity0 released @entity62 for what might easily have been the third on the half hour but the latter hit a post			0
@entity33 was the next to come agonisingly close , dribbling through the @entity4 defence from @entity1 ’s pass only to be denied by @entity28			2
it would have been the pick of the first - half goals and a corner , from which @entity8 rarely score , was scant reward for the brilliance			0
@entity4 forced two corners late in the first - half , one blocked by @entity24 , the other by his central defensive partner @entity57 , who was also caught in possession on his own byline but recovered well to clear			2
@entity8 's first goal was a wonderful team move , finished by @entity99 @entity150 to explore more of our brilliant @entity151 @entity110 ( back centre ) watches on during the match at the @entity27 ahead of his potential debut in this weekend 's @entity155 @entity156 ( left ) chats with former @entity8 and @entity4 star @entity86 ahead of the @entity38 clash at the @entity27 @entity33 poses with @entity159 in the locker room , posting he 's happy with the result but looks forward to @entity155 this weekend @entity4 players react in disappointment after falling behind to a striker from @entity8 's @entity99 striker @entity1 at the @entity27 @entity99 forward @entity1 ( left ) is congratulated by his @entity8 team - mates after putting the @entity35 ahead against @entity4 at the @entity27 @entity167 forward @entity0 ( left ) dribbles past @entity4 defender @entity73 during the @entity38 encounter on tuesday @entity8 players embrace @entity1 ( left ) after he gave the home side an eight - minute advantage at the @entity27 on tuesday @entity0 points at his team - mates and smiles with joy after putting @entity8 ahead at the @entity27 in the @entity38 on tuesday the @entity167 forward ( centre ) ghosts through the @entity4 defence as he advances towards the opposition goal at the @entity27 on tuesday @entity4 players , including @entity181 ( second right ) celebrate netting to make the scoreline 2 - 1 at the @entity27 on tuesday @entity185 and team spirit pleases @entity186 @entity0 resumed the goal hunt at the start of the second - half , scoring from @entity62 ’s saved shot only for an offside flag to rule the effort out			1
he then dribbled through @entity4 ’s six - yard box with mesmerizing close control , the ball never leaving his laces , defenders floundering , only for his shot to hit the side - netting			0
as the close control from @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity25 reached new levels , @entity4 ’s defenders were made to look even more clumsy with @entity25 unceremoniously up - ended on the edge of the penalty area by @entity74			1
on the hour they were at least spared further punishment from @entity1 who was replaced by @entity47 and @entity0 followed him five minutes later			1
@entity4 's @entity80 ( left ) attempts to challenge @entity0 for the ball during the @entity38 encounter on tuesday @entity56 , @entity8 's goalkeeper , squirts his water bottle during a quiet evening for the stopper at the @entity27 @entity8 full back @entity25 ( left ) duels for the ball with @entity4 's @entity213 during the first half of the clash at the @entity27 @entity33 of @entity8 ( centre ) tries to evade the challenge of the @entity4 defence as he advances with the ball at the @entity27 some had questioned if @entity186 was strong enough to substitute his most famous player after images from the weekend league game seemed to show @entity0 being asked if he wanted to come off and asking to be left on			1
this was @entity186 showing who is boss , and @entity0 getting some extra rest ahead of saturday ’s @entity155			2
@entity4 seemed to be breathing a little more easily after the changes and , with two minutes left , @entity181 scored to make it 2 - 1 but before they could dare to dream of earning an undeserved point @entity47 scored @entity8 's third			1
@entity8 's @entity24 ( left ) , @entity62 ( centre ) and @entity60 ( right ) challenge @entity4 's @entity231 ( centre ) for the ball @entity159 ( left ) of @entity8 shoots against @entity4 during his side 's home victory in the @entity38 group stage on tuesday @entity4 defender @entity237 ( left ) attempts to stop @entity8 forward @entity1 as he advances with the ball at the @entity27 @entity60 ( left ) , @entity57 and @entity4 's @entity80 compete for the ball in the air during the first half at the @entity27 on tuesday @entity240 ( right ) of @entity4 attempts to push @entity8 forward @entity1 off the ball during the @entity38 clash on tuesday @entity8 defender @entity57 ( right ) hacks down @entity4 's @entity82 during the @entity38 encounter at the @entity27 @entity8 head coach @entity186 ( right ) shouts instructions at his players as @entity4 boss @entity245 ( left ) looks on in disappointment @entity4 players leave the pitch looks distraught following their 3 - 1 loss against @entity8 at the @entity27 in the @entity38			1

@entity1 opened the scoring for @entity8 with a *lovely* placed finish after eight minutes at the @entity27
@entity0 doubled @entity8 's lead ( 24 ) as the @entity167 forward grabbed his 69th @entity38 goal
@entity0 has goal *disallowed* for offside just three minutes into the second half against @entity7 champions @entity4
@entity8 sub @entity47 scored the home side 's third and final goal when he was played through in injury time
substitute @entity181 scores a late *consolation* for @entity4 as they still search for first win in *competition*
@entity8 's two strikers both substituted before the 66 - minute mark ahead of saturday 's @entity155 with @entity10
