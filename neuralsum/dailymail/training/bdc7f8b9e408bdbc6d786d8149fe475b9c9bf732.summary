by @entity0 @entity2 's ever - increasing portfolio of unusual official sponsors just got weirder after stars @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 were roped in to advertise a range of @entity10 meatballs			1
perhaps the threesome were being punished for the club 's most unsuccessful season in @entity15 history , especially as none seemed able to raise a smile during some acting so wooden it deserved to carry a fire warning			0
the players were filmed going through a few moves inter-spliced with shots of some rice / pasta accompanied dishes that look as if they could have come straight from the picture menu of a downmarket takeaway			0
@entity28 courage : @entity5 goes through the motions for another unusual @entity2 sponsor not fair ! youngster @entity7 had a good enough debut season not to be punished this way yummy ! the @entity10 meatballs do n't look the most appealing of three - minute meals in safe hands : @entity6 struggled to raise a smile while expanding the club 's @entity39 market but , the most embarrassing moment is reserved for the end when all three players are forced to stare into the camera and announce ' we love @entity46 ! ' ( meaning three - minute meals )			1
since the @entity48 gained control of @entity2 , the club has collected an expanding list of sponsors you may not usually associate with a football club			2
these include : mister potato ( @entity55 ) , @entity57 ( @entity58 ) , @entity59 ( @entity60 ) , @entity62 ( @entity61 in @entity63 ) , and @entity64 ( @entity56 ) .			0
