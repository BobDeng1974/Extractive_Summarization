by @entity0 a woman who was told she would have to hang up her running shoes due to a rare neurological condition has found a way to continue training - by running backwards			1
@entity6 , 46 , from @entity7 , has focal dystonia , a condition which affects a muscle or group of muscles causing involuntary spasms and abnormal postures			1
athletes and musicians are prone to the condition as a result of overusing muscles when carrying out a specific movement			0
@entity6 , 46 , has overcome a rare muscle condition by learning to run backwards but ms @entity6 has discovered that if she runs backwards the spasms do not impede her training			1
‘ i always had a passion for running and nothing could stop me			2
not even a rare neurological disease			0
i have always been a runner , ’ ms @entity6 said			1
the @entity7 had a passion for the sport her entire life , and successfully competed on the @entity31 track team , even qualifying for the @entity33 trials in 1992			0
but in 1989 , she began noticing some physical abnormalities that mysteriously crept up on her while she was sprinting			0
during the @entity33 trials , these strange symptoms caused ms @entity6 to repeatedly bump into the barrier during the race , and she finished second to last at the event			1
‘ i use to feel like it 's a flutter in my leg at the end of the runs			2
my leg was n't moving correctly through running , ’ she said			1
ms @entity6 has focal dystonia which means she experiences leg spasms if she runs normally ms @entity6 's was determined not to give up running so started looking into possible solutions ‘ i went to a million different types of doctors			1
i had a @entity50 , a ct scan , orthopaedics and so on			0
’ as the condition progressed , ms @entity6 found the focal dystonia caused her left leg to move involuntarily and spasmodically to one side , preventing her from running in a straight line			1
‘ if i do n't stop running , my left knee is facing out and my foot is landing outside the sole of the shoe , ’ she said			2
focal dystonia can be treated with @entity64 injections , which prevents the symptoms by paralysing the affected muscle , but in ms @entity6 ’s case , the affected muscles are too deep to isolate			1
she also tried drugs for @entity70 to banish her symptoms - but their effectiveness would wear off over time			0
ms @entity6 and her doctor discovered she can still run backwards as it uses different motions ms @entity6 is now even organising a backwards running competition in @entity7 determined not to give up running , ms @entity6 tried experimenting with new ways of running , initially moving in a zigzag pattern			1
but it was n't until she met dr @entity80 that she hit upon her ingenious backwards technique			2
she said : ‘ i went to a million types of doctors and by dr @entity80 i was suggested to run backwards			1
so i tried it and it gave me something that was really working and was a new adventure			0
’ dr @entity80 added : ‘ @entity89 is often associated very much with one repeated motion over and over			0
so coming up with a way that does n't use that motion may give you a way around it			2
’ ms @entity6 now runs with a smile along on the sand around @entity98 and @entity99 , and has even teamed up with dr @entity80 to organise a backwards running race in @entity98 to raise awareness of focal dystonia in runners			1
dystonia is a disorder which causes involuntary muscle contracts and abnormal postures			2
the movements may be painful and some patients also have a tremor			0
there are several different forms of dystonia - including focal dystonia , which just affects one part of the body			1
dystonia is a disorder which causes involuntary muscle contracts and abnormal postures - focal dystonia affects just one part of the body focal dystonia often only affects one specific action while allowing others to occur unimpeded			1
for example , a musician may have dystonia when using her hand to play an instrument , but not when using the same hand to write			0
in some cases , the condition becomes progressively worse while in others it is stable			0
it is not known exactly what causes dystonia - many cases do not have any clear cause			2
however , it is thought it can be triggered by a defective gene or by certain medications			0
dystonia can develop at any age and there are currently no medications that can prevent or cure it			0
in some cases , @entity64 injections can help by preventing the muscle contractions			0

@entity6 has focal dystonia which causes involuntary spasms
it affects one of her legs when she runs meaning she ca n't travel straight
she did not want to give up running so started looking for a solution
46 - year - old discovered she can run backwards without suffering spasms
