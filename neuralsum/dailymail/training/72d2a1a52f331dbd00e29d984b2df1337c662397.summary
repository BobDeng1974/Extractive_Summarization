@entity0 appeared to admit using human shields to fire rockets into @entity3 for the first time today , but refused to accept responsibility for the slaughter of hundreds of innocent @entity7 killed in retaliatory airstrikes			1
in a veiled confession that comes two weeks after the end of the @entity13 war , a senior @entity0 official said the group 's fighters had no choice but to use residential areas from which to launch missiles into their neighbour 's territory			1
but while @entity22 claimed they took safeguards to keep people away from the violence , he admitted ' mistakes were made ' , blaming @entity3 's heavy - handed response for the deaths of civilians			1
increasingly , the discussion is not about whether the @entity0 rockets were fired from civilian areas , but exactly how close they were to the actual buildings smoke and fire : hundreds of innocent @entity7 civilians were killed by @entity3 airstrikes unleashed in response to @entity0 rocket attacks , launched from residential areas ' @entity13 , from @entity58 in the north to @entity60 in the south , is one uninterrupted urban chain that @entity3 has turned into a war zone , ' said mr @entity22 , a senior @entity0 official in @entity13			1
increasingly , the discussion is not about whether the @entity0 rockets were fired from civilian areas , but exactly how close they were to the actual buildings			1
' the @entity3 kept saying rockets were fired from schools or hospitals when in fact they were fired 200 or 300 meters ( yards ) away			1
still , there were some mistakes made and they were quickly dealt with , ' @entity22 told @entity72 , offering the first acknowledgment by a @entity0 official that , in some cases , militants fired rockets from or near residential areas or civilian facilities			1
the questions lie at the heart of a brewing international legal confrontation : did @entity0 deliberately and systematically fire rockets at @entity3 from homes , hospitals and schools in the hope that @entity3 would be deterred from retaliating , as @entity3 claims ? or did @entity3 use force excessively , resulting in deaths among people not involved in combat operations ? the answers could help determine whether @entity3 - or @entity0 - or both are ultimately accused of violating the international laws of war in a conflict that caused tremendous damage			1
according to @entity7 figures , nearly 2,200 @entity7 were killed - roughly three quarters of them civilians and including more than 500 children - and 11,000 were wounded			1
the war also left some 100,000 homeless			0
seventy - two people were killed on the @entity3 side , including six civilians			1
men evacuate a survivor of an @entity3 airstrike that hit the @entity111 family building in @entity60 , southern @entity13			0
but many members of her family were not so lucky ahead of a @entity117 investigation , the @entity3 military has released reams of evidence , including satellite photos and aerial footage , to support its claims that it acted responsibly and attempted to minimize @entity7 casualties			0
it asserts that @entity0 made no effort to disguise its attempt to maximize @entity3 civilian casualties			1
throughout the war , the @entity3 air force compiled dozens of video clips showing alleged wrongdoing by @entity0 , an @entity131 militant group sworn to @entity3 's destruction			1
these videos , many of them posted on @entity136 , appear to show rockets flying out of residential neighborhoods , cemeteries , schoolyards and mosque courtyards			1
there are also images of weapons caches purportedly uncovered inside mosques , and tunnels allegedly used by militants to scurry between homes , mosques and buildings			0
' @entity0 ' excuses are outrageous , misleading and contrary to the evidence supplied by the @entity34 ( @entity3 @entity34 ) and the reality documented by international journalists on the ground in @entity13 , ' said lt. col. @entity156 , an @entity3 military spokesman			0
confession : in a veiled confession that comes two weeks after the end of the @entity13 war , a senior @entity0 official today said the group 's fighters had no choice but to use residential areas from which to launch missiles into their neighbour 's territory but a black - and - white satellite image released by the @entity3 military illustrates the difficulties in proving the point			1
the army says the image , taken of the @entity36 neighborhood of @entity37 , shows four rocket launch sites sitting next to a cluster of schools and a nearby residential neighborhood			1
such images , it says , are evidence that @entity0 used built - up areas for cover - and carelessly exposed civilians to danger in @entity3 retaliatory strikes			1
however , the image itself is grainy and shows no clear signs of rocket activity , though rocket launchers are often hidden underground			0
the army refused to say how it had made its conclusions			1
a visit to the area this week found three separate military sites - possibly training grounds - slightly larger than football fields located close to the state schools			0
smoke trails behind multiple missiles fired at @entity3 from the @entity13 the sites are mostly concealed from street view by barriers made of corrugated iron , but one bore the sign of @entity0 ' military wing , @entity207 , while another bore the sign of the @entity210 , a militant group allied with @entity0			1
visible from the outside were human cutout figures and what appeared to be exercise hurdles			0
there were no overt signs of rocket launchers or craters in the ground outside , though dirt appeared to have been disturbed either by some sort of blast or the work of heavy military - type trucks			0
there were pieces of mangled concrete scattered on the ground			0
the school buildings appeared untouched			0
@entity0 tightly restricts access to such facilities , and it was impossible for photographers to enter the sites			0
@entity3 confirmed the area was targeted in airstrikes			1
another location identified by the @entity3 military as a rocket - launching site is in northern @entity13 around the newly built @entity243 hospital			0
immediately to the north of the two - story hospital and across the road to the west are two @entity0 military facilities			0
both stand in close proximity to residential homes			0
the hospital stands intact , while nothing is visible from inside the bases			0
@entity22 , the @entity0 official , argued that many of the buildings shown in @entity3 videos were either a safe distance from the rocket launchers or that the buildings had been kept vacant during the fighting			1
the ground in @entity37 , for instance , lies some 150 meters ( yards ) away from the neighborhood , and the schools were empty for summer vacation			0
during 50 days of fighting , many observers witnessed rocket launches from what appeared to be urban areas			2
one piece of video footage distributed by the @entity72 , for instance , captured a launch in downtown @entity36 that took place in a lot next to a mosque and an office of the @entity0 prime minister			2
both buildings were badly damaged in subsequent @entity3 airstrikes			2
there was other evidence of @entity0 having used civilian facilities : early in the conflict , the @entity117 agency that cares for @entity7 refugees announced that it discovered weapons stored in its schools as they stood empty during the summer			2
' i do n't think there 's any doubt urban areas were used to launch rockets from in the @entity13 , ' said @entity298 , a senior researcher at @entity299			1
' what needs to be determined is how close to a populated building or a civilian area were those rocket launches			2
' the issue may never be conclusively settled as both sides voice competing narratives over their conduct in the deadliest and most ruinous of the three wars since @entity0 seized control of @entity13 in 2007			0
@entity7 gather as rescue workers search for victims under the rubble of a house which witnesses said was destroyed in an @entity3 air strike , in @entity60 in the southern @entity13 ' yes , @entity0 and others may have used civilians as human shields , but was that consistent and widespread ? ' said @entity319 , a @entity320 who represents the @entity322 in @entity13			2
' the question is whether @entity3 's response was proportionate			0
' the war erupted on july 8 when @entity3 launched a massive aerial bombardment of @entity13 in response to weeks of heavy rocket fire by @entity0 and other @entity13 - based militant groups - part of an escalation that began with the killing by a @entity0 cell of three @entity3 teens in the @entity335			0
the @entity3 army says @entity0 fired almost 4,000 rockets at @entity3 , including 600 from close to schools , mosques and other civilian facilities , and scores of mortar shells			1
@entity3 carried out some 5,000 airstrikes , in addition to using powerful artillery and gunship fire			2
frequently , @entity3 arms struck hospitals , schools , homes , mosques , factories and office towers			0
@entity3 said the buildings had been used for cover by militant fighters , and that whenever possible , it provided warning to civilians that strikes on their buildings were coming			2
@entity3 disputes the makeup of the @entity7 casualty figures , saying that nearly half the dead were militants			0
nevertheless , the death toll and number of civilian deaths have led to harsh condemnations of @entity3 and raised questions on the proportionality of @entity3 's response			1
in an apparent attempt to head off international investigations , the @entity3 military said wednesday it has opened criminal investigations into two high - profile cases involving @entity7 civilian casualties			2
@entity0 also has been sharply criticized for launching rockets aimed at @entity3 cities and towns			2
@entity3 says its own civilian death toll would have been much higher had it not been for its rocket defenses			2
the @entity381 has appointed a commission to look into the latest fighting			0
its report is expected no sooner than march .			0

@entity386 says group had no choice but to launch rockets from civilian areas
@entity22 : safeguards taken to *protect* civilians but ' we made mistakes '
he refuses to accept responsibility for deaths in retaliatory airstrikes
