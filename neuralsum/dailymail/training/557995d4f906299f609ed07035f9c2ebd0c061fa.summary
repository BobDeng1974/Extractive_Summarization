@entity33 rescue teams from @entity34 and @entity35 were also scrambled			0
the helicopter winched down a crew member to the rocks , and the dog owner was airlifted to a nearby field			2
@entity6 supervisor @entity41 said : ' thankfully , despite the distance of the fall , the man had only minor injuries			2
' amazingly the dog was absolutely fine , and had actually made his way to the beach on his own			0
' he added : ' conditions today were fairly benign , with neap tides and only a little swell			0
