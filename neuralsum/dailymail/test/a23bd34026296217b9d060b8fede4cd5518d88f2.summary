an @entity1 woman who was forced to marry her rapist and have his baby has revealed how she gave up all of her hopes and dreams to ' buy ' her daughter 's future			2
known only by the name @entity11 , the @entity9 - based woman was only 16 - years - old when she fell pregnant with the child of her depraved attacker @entity14 - who is also married to her cousin			1
even though a rape led to her pregnancy , @entity11 's brothers insisted she would not be allowed to return to her ' shamed ' family as she was unmarried and a @entity9 court sentenced her to two years in prison for ' adultery by force ' , later increased to 12 years following an appeal			1
the only hope of a reduced sentence was to marry @entity14 , which she did in early 2013			0
now she is pregnant with his third child but insists she only agreed to marry her rapist so that her first daughter - named @entity32 - could live a shame - free life in the @entity1 capital 's ' traditional ' society			2
just over two years after @entity11 married @entity14 , the couple agreed to a joint interview with @entity40 's @entity39			1
victim : known only by the name @entity11 ( left ) , the woman was only 16 - years - old when she fell pregnant with @entity32 ( centre ) - the child of her rapist @entity14 ( right ) agonising decision : @entity11 said that she had married the man who had attacked her because she did n't want to ruin her daughter 's life @entity11 said that her decision to marry the rapist was purely based on the fact her daughter , @entity32 , would have been unable to live a normal life in the @entity1 capital without a father			1
tragic : @entity11 said that her decision to marry the rapist enabled smile to live a normal life ' i did n't want to ruin the life of my daughter or leave myself helpless so i agreed to marry him , ' she said			1
' we are traditional people			0
when we get a bad name , we prefer death to living with that name in society , ' @entity11 added , reportedly refusing to look her husband in the eye during the interview			2
@entity14 - who was jailed for the rape but subsequently had sentence reduced - appears totally remorseless about his crime			0
he insists that by agreeing to marry her , he actually ' rescued ' @entity11			0
' if i had n't married her according to our traditions , she could n't have lived back in society , ' he said			0
' her brothers did n't want to accept her back			0
now , she does n't have any of those problems , ' he added			0
@entity14 is still married to his first wife - @entity11 's first cousin - with whom he has five children			1
in total seven children and three adults live in the family house			0
@entity11 was found guilty of ' adultery by force ' following the brutal attack in 2008			2
when the case came to court @entity11 was sentenced to two years in jail , which was later increased to 12 years on appeal			1
a first release offer , which she eventually agreed to , stipulated she must marry her attacker			0
however her sentence was then cut to three years after a third appeal , and , according to reports at the time , the requirement for her to marry the man , who himself was jailed for seven years , was dropped			0
@entity11 gave birth to her daughter in the @entity102 women 's jail in @entity9 before then president @entity103 took the highly unusual step of freeing her with no pre-conditions in december 2011			1
released from prison , @entity11 faced a life of isolation and poverty as mothers without husbands are shunned by their communities and their own families and become social outcasts			2
although there was no longer a legal obligation for her to so , @entity11 later approached the rapist 's family to arrange the terms of marriage and give smile the best chance of a normal life			1
