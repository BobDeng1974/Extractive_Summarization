by @entity0 an @entity2 inventor has designed a new fridge that can keep live - saving vaccines cool for 35 days without power			1
the appliance is designed for use in the developing world where some remote areas have no electricity , power cuts can be frequent and vaccines are vital for healthy communities			1
the @entity14 has donated a $ 1.4million ( £ 836,000 ) to help fridge company @entity15 further develop the potentially life - saving design			1
the @entity28 fridges can keep its life - saving contents cool at a regular 4 ° c for up to 35 days - even if the temperature outside is as high as 43 ° c at 4 ° c , water is at its heaviest and sinks			1
this explains why lakes can be frozen but fish can swim beneath the surface			0
the same concept is used to create the fridge that adapts its temperature naturally so it automatically cools to the optimum temperature - a constant 4 ° c even without power			1
@entity42 surrounds a @entity28 refrigeration compartment			2
when the fridge is hooked up to a power source , the water cools and forms ice around the compartment to leave only water at four degrees cooling the contents			2
however , when the power is turned off , the water warms and rises while the ice melts , so that only water at @entity52 remains , cooling the contents of the compartment			0
@entity20 of the @entity59 , based in @entity60 , @entity61 , developed the unique cooling technology which uses water to keep supplies of vaccines cool in remote medical centres			1
‘ the devices will allow vaccines to be stored safely in challenging environments with no power and ambient temperatures as high as 43 ° c , ’ he said			2
‘ conventional refrigeration technologies can put vaccines at risk of either freezing or getting too warm			0
’ ‘ our technology ensures that vaccines reach children in the best condition possible and has the potential to save the lives of countless children across the world			2
’ at 4 ° c water sinks and this scientific fact inspired mr @entity20 to create the new refrigeration system that adapts its temperature naturally so it automatically cools to the optimum temperature - a constant 4 ° c even without power			1
this temperature is perfect for storing food and vaccines			0
@entity93 lives : the $ 1.4million ( £ 836,000 ) cash from the @entity14 will enable the @entity96 firm to start field trials in @entity98 and @entity99 for the new coolers within the next year			1
here , a different model is moved into place at a remote health centre it works because water surrounds a @entity28 refrigeration compartment			2
when the fridge is hooked up to a power source , the water cools and forms ice around the compartment to leave only water at 4 ° c , cooling the contents			1
however , when the power is turned off , the water warms and rises while the ice melts , so that still only water at @entity52 remains cooling the contents of the compartment			0
the company said that its fridge has ‘ its own internal and entirely natural energy store that maintains a completely steady temperature			0
the system can operate like this , without power , for days and weeks			0
’ the invention has received financial backing from the @entity14 , which aims to transform people ’s lives who are living in poverty without access to adequate healthcare			0
the $ 1.4million ( £ 836,000 ) cash injection will enable the @entity96 firm to start field trials in @entity98 and @entity99 for the new coolers within the next year			1
the firm already has 10 - day vaccine refrigerators operating in over 30 countries - and is recognised by the @entity141			0
it shipped 200 devices to the @entity143 at the beginning of this year to help @entity145 in the wake of @entity147			0
good things come in small packages : the firm already has 10 - day vaccine refrigerators operating in over 30 countries - and is recognised by the @entity141			0
it is also developing a small vaccine cooler ( pictured ) that is more portable and could be taken to remote areas in an emergency			2

an inventor in @entity60 , @entity61 , has received $ 1.4million ( £ 836,000 ) from @entity159 *founder* @entity158 to develop his @entity28 fridge
appliance is designed for use in the developing world where power cuts can be frequent and some remote areas are without any electricity
@entity169 can store vaccines at 4 ° c without power for up to 35 days
technology is based on the fact that at 4 ° c water is at its heaviest and sinks
