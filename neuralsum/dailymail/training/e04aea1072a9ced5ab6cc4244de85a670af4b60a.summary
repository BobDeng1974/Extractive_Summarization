@entity0 owes @entity1 a big performance and what a place this would be to produce it			1
back in his native @entity5 , a world champion , making his 50th appearance in the @entity8			1
the stage seems perfectly set			0
@entity10 accepts there will be intense scrutiny on his @entity14 trio , but the 80,000 fans who ignite @entity17 ’s westfalen - stadion with their high - visibility traditional yellow colours and an incessant din are unlikely to provide a generous homecoming for the @entity23 heroes			1
@entity0 is a product of fierce local rivals @entity25 , 30 miles to the west , in @entity27 , although it is nearly seven years since he left for @entity29 and @entity30 before @entity1 decided to invest a club record £ 42.5million in his talents			1
@entity1 star @entity0 has struggled since the end of last season @entity0 will be hoping his campaign can take off for @entity1 in @entity14 0 @entity0 has yet to be involved in a goal for @entity1 this year — either scoring or assisting			1
in the @entity38 and @entity8 last season , he was directly involved in 17 goals at a rate of one every other game			1
623 he has not scored in 623 minutes of football for the north @entity44 club			0
423 in 136 @entity46 and @entity8 games for @entity30 , @entity0 created 423 chances , including 61 assists			1
in his 37 games in the same competitions for @entity1 , he has created 102 chances and set up 11 goals			1
unhappy homecomings @entity0 began his career in @entity14 with @entity25 and @entity29 but has not enjoyed playing back on home soil			1
in five matches away to @entity14 sides , he has won just once , drawing one and losing three , including @entity30 ’s 4 - 1 thrashing by @entity17 in the 2013 @entity8 semi-final			1
@entity17 boss @entity61 swerved the chance to extol his qualities or to massage his confidence on the eve of such a vital fixture			1
‘ even if he is a @entity14 player and a national , i do n’t want to say anything about this , ’ said @entity61			1
‘ that ’s not an issue for me			0
’ @entity0 is by some distance @entity1 ’s most expensive signing and his flickering performances have been exposed by the instant impact of @entity76 , who arrived from @entity77 this summer for a mere £ 30m			1
as @entity76 proved when he ripped off his shirt after scoring against @entity79 on saturday , he is more muscular and robust and in this regard better equipped to resist the rigours of the @entity83 game			0
@entity0 ’s more slender frame and subtle skills often seem in danger of being obliterated by the chaotic blur of the @entity38			1
@entity10 , however , insists his contributions are too easily overlooked and he remains confident the 25 - year - old will be successful in north @entity44			0
perhaps it will be in @entity91 , in @entity8 football where he starts to show his true value			1
with defensive issues piling up , this is one of those games when the @entity1 boss could do with his many creative forces combining to seize the initiative			2
‘ they did the best job with the transfers this summer , ’ said @entity61 , when asked about @entity1 ’s summer spree			2

‘ they did the best job with the transfers this summer , ’ said @entity61 , when asked about @entity1 ’s summer spree			2
@entity0 celebrates scoring against @entity111 in the @entity23 , and his @entity1 anguish ( above ) ‘ the squad has great stability and they are able to play the football @entity10 wants to see , but they are even more serious because they have all options to close any spaces and are quick on the transition			1
' they have players like @entity120 and @entity0 and @entity121 , who has not played so much but shows great qualities when he plays			2
’ last year , @entity10 left @entity17 with three points after a stout defensive display and a goal from @entity126 , but this time it may have to be a different approach if they are to take the victory that would give them early control of @entity132 @entity61 ’s team are familiar foes			2
it will be the third time these clubs have met in the last four years in the group stages			0
the @entity139 runners - up are riddled with injuries which have ruled out important players such as @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
@entity0 looked relaxed in training ahead of the clash with @entity17 @entity148 says @entity1 will look to put down a marker against @entity17 @entity150 moved on to @entity151 in the summer but @entity152 has lifted spirits since his return from @entity155 , scoring on his debut against @entity157 on saturday			1
‘ it was sensational , ’ said @entity61			0
‘ i was kind of surprised he was on the market once again			0
maybe he did n’t fit in			0
we saw the chance and took it			0
’ it has been @entity1 ’s failure to top the group which led them into the clutches of @entity151 and an exit at the first knockout stage in each of the last two years			2
‘ the first game will show where we ’re at , ’ said @entity169 centre back per @entity148			2
‘ the group is tough and we have to show from the start we are ready and focused			0
’ this @entity8 will end in @entity14 , with a final in @entity176 in june and , for three of the four @entity83 clubs involved , it starts against opposition from the @entity139			1
the nation is on a football high after their triumph in @entity182 and @entity10 will hope to enjoy some of the benefit with @entity0 , @entity184 and @entity148 thriving on the added motivation of a home final			2
@entity10 admits there 's added pressure on his @entity14 players ahead of facing @entity17 @entity1 ’s @entity14 played more in @entity182 ’s than @entity17 ’s , but an ankle injury ruled @entity0 out of the homecoming games against @entity192 and @entity193 earlier this month , and @entity148 quit international football after the @entity23			1
‘ it is always a pressure when you come back to your country , ’ said @entity10			0
‘ the attention is a bit bigger , that ’s for sure			0
@entity200 would be under scrutiny in @entity205			0
‘ it ’s not such an advantage for us to have three @entity14 players because we know @entity17 anyway			1
we play them each year			0
‘ the @entity23 final in @entity211 was on july 13 and they came back to training on august 11			0
that means i gave them one month of holiday			0
it was important for me that they would recover			0
they have been training for one month and have n’t reached 100 per cent physically yet			0

@entity169 ace in line for his 50th @entity8 appearance this week
@entity0 is a product of @entity17 's fierce rivals @entity25
@entity14 star is yet to justify £ 42.5million @entity1 paid for his *services*
