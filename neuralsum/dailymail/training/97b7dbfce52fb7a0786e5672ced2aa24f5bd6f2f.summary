by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:02 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 02:46 est , 23 november 2012 thousands of elderly people are suffering poor and unsafe care in hospitals and care homes , a watchdog said last night			1
callous staff routinely treat pensioners with little respect and do not even help them to eat their meals when they are clearly malnourished			2
fifteen per cent of hospitals and 20 per cent of nursing homes failed to meet national standards on ensuring residents had enough food and drink , and the help they needed to consume it , a report found			1
shameful : callous care home staff routinely treat pensioners with little respect and do not even help them to eat their meals when they are malnourished , a report found ten per cent of @entity26 hospitals and 15 per cent of nursing homes failed to meet standards on treating patients with dignity and respect			1
only 2 per cent of private hospitals had the same failings			2
the damning study by the @entity36 watchdog revealed that too many doctors , nurses and care home staff see patients not as people but as tasks to be completed			1
care staff ‘ fail to see past the illness ’ or ‘ treat each person as someone deserving respect and understanding , empathy and kindness ’			1
the report is based on evidence from 13,000 @entity36 inspections carried out last year			2
inspectors found examples of nurses failing to close curtains when they were carrying out personal tasks , talking over patients and speaking to them in a ‘ condescending or dismissive way ’			1
many hospitals had call bells out of reach , or their staff failed to answer them in a reasonable @entity64 also failed to identify patients who were malnourished or to ensure they had food if they missed a set meal time because they were having an operation			1
short - staffing at almost a quarter of nursing homes and 16 per cent of hospitals was putting the quality and safety of care at risk , it found			1
not having enough staff was a ‘ major ingredient ’ of poor care			2
where ‘ staff are stretched ’ standards slip , the report said			2
fourteen per cent of hospitals and no fewer than 33 per cent of nursing homes failed to give and keep medicines correctly			1
three quarters of nursing homes failed to train staff correctly			1
eleven per cent of hospitals failed to ensure decent cleanliness and infection control			2
failings : too many doctors , nurses and care home staff see patients not as people but as tasks to be completed , the @entity36 found the @entity99 has long exposed poor treatment of the elderly in hospitals , nursing homes and residential homes as part of its @entity107 campaign			1
the state of care report blamed the failings on a culture where ‘ the unacceptable becomes the norm ’			0
' this report is a serious indictment of the way that older people are cared for in @entity116 today ' @entity118 director general @entity117 it said : ‘ those who are responsible for the training and development of staff need to look hard at why “ care ” often seems to be broken down into tasks to be completed – focusing on the unit of work , rather than the person who needs to be looked after			1
it is not good enough and it is not what people want and expect			0
kindness and compassion cost nothing			0
’ the @entity36 , which regulates health and social care in @entity116 , said it found too many hospitals and homes where patients are treated as objects			1
‘ a lack of dignity and respect is a persistent issue and one that has been hard to shift , ’ the report said			2
‘ staff have a huge responsibility to see past the illness or condition and to the patient as a person			0
’ in care homes , the report condemned examples of poor care including cutting up someone ’s food without asking them , and ‘ getting people ready for bed at a time that suits staff rather than the individual people being cared for ’			1
lack of help with eating and drinking is a real concern , the report found			0
age @entity118 ’s charity director general , @entity117 , said : ‘ this report is a serious indictment of the way that older people are cared for in @entity116 today			0
‘ it is appalling that 15 per cent of hospitals and 20 per cent of nursing homes failed to ensure people were given the food and drink they needed and that a significant proportion were equally unable to protect the dignity and respect of their patients and residents			1
’ health secretary @entity185 said : ‘ there can be no hiding place for those providing poor care			0
’ needed paramedics : @entity191 holding one of his grandchildren war veteran @entity191 , 83 , died at a care home after a nurse refused to call an ambulance			1
@entity197 noticed that the great - grandfather – who had been transferred to the @entity200 nursing home six days earlier – was ‘ blue - grey in colour ’ and in obvious pain			0
but when care assistants told senior nurse @entity205 he needed an ambulance , she rang the out - of - hours gp instead			0
as mr @entity191 deteriorated , she ignored further pleas to call paramedics and gave him constipation medicine instead			0
he died of a severe water infection an hour later , before the doctor arrived			0
coroner @entity214 told an inquest earlier this year that the efforts of miss @entity205 , who was trained in her native @entity219 , ‘ fell well short ’ of expectations			0
mr @entity191 was a sergeant in @entity220 in the @entity221 before settling in @entity222 , @entity223 , where he worked for a steel firm			0
he moved to his first care home in 2006 after developing dementia but in 2009 an ulcer on his leg was left unchecked and ultimately led to amputation			2
shortly afterwards , his two daughters moved him to @entity200 ’s @entity232 home in @entity233			0
he died six days later , on december 28 , 2009			0
the coroner recorded a verdict of death by natural causes but said the care mr @entity191 received had been ‘ minimal , unprofessional and ineffective ’ .			0

ten per cent of @entity26 hospitals and 15 per cent of care homes failed to treat elderly people with *sufficient* dignity and respect , a watchdog found
