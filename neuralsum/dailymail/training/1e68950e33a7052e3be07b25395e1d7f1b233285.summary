why we make things and why it matters by @entity2 told us that , if we ever needed him , even in the middle of the night , all we had to do was to pick up the phone			1
he was an electrician , this chap , but also had a passable knowledge of plumbing and carpentry , making him a wonderfully - competent , all - round handyman			2
i remember feeling inadequate , for my own skills are creative , but not practical			2
as a writer , i could hardly reciprocate his kindness			0
what would i say ? ‘ and likewise , should you ever need a perfectly formed sentence at 3am			0
’ @entity2 writes seductively about the fulfilment he gets from making furniture ( picture posed by model ) this exquisitely - produced little book had a similar , humbling effect on me			1
@entity2 makes beautiful , bespoke furniture ; at his celebrated school in @entity37 , in the far north - east of @entity38 , he teaches others how to do it , too			1
this is not a how - to manual , though — it is a philosophical treatise about the process and the emotional rewards of creating something tangible , useful , long - lasting and attractive to look at			0
my branch of creativity seems rather feeble by comparison			0
@entity2 writes seductively about the fulfilment he gets from making furniture			1
while the book did n’t quite make me want to go and bevel an edge , it did help me understand how a lovingly handcrafted chair or desk might be considered a counterblast to what @entity2 describes as modern society ’s ‘ rampant consumerism ’			1
as he asserts , handmade furniture ‘ speaks of durability at a time when most goods are disposable			1
it speaks of integrity of process in a culture where surface impressions are often all that matter ’			0
which is true enough , but @entity72 on a saturday afternoon is full of people who might well prefer to be buying handmade furniture — if only they could afford it			2
i do n’t think @entity76 means that they are doing the wrong thing , just that they — we — should take more time to appreciate proper craftsmanship			0
that he thinks as deeply as he does about furniture - making clearly has something to do with two serious bouts of cancer , once in his 20s and again in his 40s			2
brushes with death do tend to make a chap more introspective and the book , taking the form of a memoir , details other convulsions in his life , such as financial hardship , romantic heartache and divorce			1
but through all his tribulations , the dovetail joint has held firm			0
i know devoted cricketers and golfers who will tell you , without the slightest irony , that their sports are metaphors for life , and @entity2 , without ever quite being pretentious enough to say so , seems to believe the same of fashioning tables and chairs			1
‘ in furniture - making , beginnings are critical , ’ he says			2
and a little later : ‘ throughout the entire process , the quality achievable at each stage is utterly dependent on the care with which the craftsman has accomplished every previous step			0
’ well , what is that if not a guideline on how we should all get the most out of our lives ?			0

@entity2 makes bespoke furniture at his school in @entity37
not only does he create the pieces himself , he teaches others too
in his new book , @entity2 *explains* why we should make our own furniture
