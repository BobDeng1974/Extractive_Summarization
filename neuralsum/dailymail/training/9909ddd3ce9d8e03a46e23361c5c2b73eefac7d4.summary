the @entity1 , it most certainly ai n’t			1
while those further up the food chain console themselves with the knowledge that they ’re doing @entity8 for a club that will be here long after @entity11 has departed , the manager is the guy left to deal with the realities on the ground			1
from the eloquent @entity15 , there is no pretence that the @entity18 group into which @entity19 were pitched on friday can possibly compare to what might have been			1
no disrespect to the good people of @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , but it hardly compares with taking on the very best from the @entity27 and @entity28			1
instead of trying to blow smoke , @entity11 simply accepts @entity31 ’s second - tier club competition for what it is			1
just as he accepts the responsibility for his team ’ s play - off failure against @entity37			1
‘ it is better to take it out on me than on the rest			2
but i hope now i am going to show that we are going to progress as a team			2
we have also had some good games so far , it ’s not only been bad , but of course the @entity1 has been a big influence here			1
‘ i saw a lot of emotions through that and , now we have done that , we have to look forward to what we ’re going to do in the league and building that style of play and the team we want			2
‘ the supporters and everyone wants to go into the @entity1			1
that ’s the main thing			2
if you lose it , the emotions come , you get very sad of course and it ’s not easy to see the big picture			2
’ home disadvantage : the @entity19 manager looks on as @entity37 celebrate their 1 - 0 victory at @entity80 talk of big pictures and grand projects usually meets with short shrift and some fairly unprepossessing criticism from fans who view promises of jam tomorrow with a fair degree of suspicion			1
talking about the reaction since tuesday night ’s loss , @entity11 said : ‘ of course it is hard			1
but you have to look at the longer prospects and work on what you believe in - and build the team how you want it			1
‘ that has also been harder with the pressure on the @entity1 all the time			1
now that chapter is gone we can control the situation and the next chapter is to build the team and to get ready for next year			2
‘ we have to do good performances this year so we achieve the things we want to do			2
that ’s a big task but that ’s why i came here			2
‘ it ’s very different when you see that three matches into the league , your season is over – that ’s if i listen to some people ! ‘ we ’ve got a lot of matches left in the league and a lot of matches in @entity31 and the cups , hopefully			2
’ @entity127 strike : @entity37 's @entity128 scored in the second leg to give @entity37 a 2 - 1 aggregate victory @entity11 is adamant that he does n’t regret a single thing – including leaving last year ’s multiple @entity132 , @entity133 , on the bench – for the dispiriting 1 - 0 home loss to a team , @entity37 , who had appeared there for the taking in last week ’s 1 - 1 away draw			1
‘ i do n’t have any regrets from tuesday , ’ he said			1
‘ we went into the game with a match plan but the first half was too passive			2
we should have gone harder on them			2
‘ but we did n’t want to sit back , we changed after the break and the first 20 minutes of the second half was much more aggressive			0
‘ look at the two matches , they were quite equal			0
that is also about skills – but i think we improved from the @entity155 game			0
‘ you never know what would have happened if you did something differently			0
but we were well prepared , had a match plan – and knew what we were going to do if things were n’t going well			0
we made changes that made the team better , we just did n’t get a final result			0
‘ you can always think about what might have been			0
but we were n’t good enough , so we take the draw we ’ve got – and look forward to competing in the @entity18			1
what could have been ? @entity11 has no regrets , including leaving @entity133 out of the starting xi ‘ our aim is to get experience , of course , and to try to get through to the next stage			1
that ’s something the club has done before but it ’s a big challenge for us			0
‘ this is a new chapter			0
we have to prepare the team to do several things – win the league and win trophies , but also make the team ready for the @entity1 next year , if we win the league			1
‘ that will make the experience will get now invaluable			0
it ’s very hard for me to say whether we should get out of this group			0
we have a good chance to make some good results there			0
‘ these are still international games against good teams			0
of course we wanted to be in the @entity1			1
but this is a good opportunity for us			0
‘ yes , we can make an impact in the @entity18			1
things are happening very quickly here			0
we ’re getting better – and we will get better all the time			0
‘ we ’ve had a lot of players out , we ’ve got new players coming in that we haven ’ t used yet			0
so the team will of course get better and better			0
‘ but it takes time to get players into the team , get injured players fit			0
let ’s see where we are in december			0
’ step down : @entity19 players react in the knowledge they will be playing in @entity31 's second tier competition in december , they ’ll be in @entity24 , taking on @entity212 in their final @entity214 fixture			1
it ’s not @entity216 , nor is it @entity218 ’s @entity217 – or @entity220 ’s @entity219			0
but it ’s where @entity19 are			1
in more ways than one			0
