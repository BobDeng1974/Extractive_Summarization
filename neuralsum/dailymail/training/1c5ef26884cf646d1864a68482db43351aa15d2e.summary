by @entity1 reporter published : 21:02 est , 5 february 2013 updated : 02:50 est , 6 february 2013 the @entity2 has been branded ' shambolic ' by mps over its handling of a contract for court language services that in one case saw an unqualified man stand in for his wife as an interpreter during a murder trial			1
the department ignored warnings that the quality of services would be sacrificed when it outsourced the contract for providing court interpreters , the @entity12 said			1
the department has also been told it may have been in contempt of parliament after it ordered court staff not to take part in the committee 's inquiry			2
' shambolic ' : sir @entity26 ( left ) blasted the department over the outsourcing of the contract to provide court interpreters , but justice minister @entity31 ( right ) said the @entity2 had since taken ' swift and robust action ' ' the @entity2 's handling of the outsourcing of court interpreting services has been nothing short of shambolic , ' committee chair sir @entity26 said			1
the contract with @entity38 ( @entity38 ) , now known as @entity39 and interpreting after it was taken over , led to court proceedings being held up and even cases collapsing after it launched early last year			1
justice minister @entity31 said while there had been ' significant ' issues at the start of the contract , the department had seen dramatic improvements after taking ' swift and robust action '			0
a lack of registered interpreters , resulting in poor quality of services and a struggle to meet demand , was among the problems faced by @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , the committee said			1
in one incident , an unqualified man arrived at the murder trial of mother - of - two @entity61 to stand in as an interpreter for his wife			0
the man turned up at @entity64 45 minutes late and concerns were raised after 30 minutes that he was not translating questions into @entity67			0
@entity61 was later jailed for life for bludgeoning her mother - in - law to death in a frenzied rage with a rolling pin			0
other issues raised included interpreters being asked to travel long distances to attend court , often from the other side of the country , poor levels of pay , a lack of qualifications and mistranslation			2
' struggle to meet demand ' : in one case an unqualified man turned up to stand in for his wife as an interpreter during a murder trial at @entity64 ( pictured ) the committee was told that one interpreter mistranslated a defendant 's statement , which ultimately gave the jury the impression that their evidence was not credible , but no action was taken			0
the @entity2 did not have a sufficient understanding of the complexities of court interpreting work before it decided to put the services out to tender , the committee said			1
there was ' clear potential for problems ' with @entity38 's ability to deliver on its promises , which were not dealt with by the @entity2 or the firm , it added			2
the company ' clearly needed significantly more resources ' than it had to deliver the service levels required			0
commenting further on the @entity2 's conduct , sir @entity26 said : ' it did not have an adequate understanding of the needs of courts , it failed to heed warnings from the professionals concerned and it did not put sufficient safeguards in place to prevent interruptions in the provision of quality interpreting services to courts			1
' this was a particular cause for concern as the @entity2 is about to launch a far - reaching competitive process for probation services as part of a ' rehabilitation revolution ' , the committee added			1
the highest priority for the @entity2 and @entity39 is to prove the contract can attract and deploy an adequate number of qualified and competent interpreters , the @entity138 said			1
in the course of the inquiry , it emerged @entity57 instructed staff not to participate in the committee 's online consultation			0
the committee said the actions of the @entity2 may have constituted a contempt of the @entity152 , but as it received sufficient evidence from other sources to make a reliable judgement , it has not asked the @entity152 to take further action			2
sir @entity26 warned that the committee members ' deplore the @entity2 's ill - advised actions and there should be no repetition of them in the future '			2
justice minister ms @entity31 said : ' there were significant issues at the start of the contract in early 2012 but we took swift and robust action , and have seen dramatic improvements , as the @entity12 highlights			0
' the vast majority of interpreter bookings are now being completed and complaints have fallen considerably			0
' the changes we have made have led to major savings for taxpayers , totalling Â£ 15 million in the first year , and we continue to monitor the contract on a daily basis and demand continuing progress			0
