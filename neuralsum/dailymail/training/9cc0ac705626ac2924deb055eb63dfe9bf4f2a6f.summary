just how regularly is @entity0 struck by asteroids ? if your answer is ‘ not very often ’ then this interactive map might change your mind			1
created by @entity7 , for @entity8 , the incredible animation below lets you scroll and zoom around the world as meteorite impacts from recorded history unfold before your eyes			1
meanwhile , in an effort to mitigate against another devastating impact in future , a @entity14 contest seeking the public ’s help to track incoming space rocks has entered its next phase			0
this interactive map made by @entity7 using @entity22 shows where asteroids have impacted on land since january 1009 ad			1
water impacts , which make up the majority of impact events , are not included the map was created by data journalist @entity7 , and shows where asteroids have impacted over the last thousand years			1
an asteroid is a large chunk of rock left over from collisions or the early solar system			1
most are located between @entity37 and @entity38 in the @entity39			0
a comet is a rock covered in ice , methane and other compounds			0
their orbits take them much further out of the solar system			0
a meteor is what we call a flash of light in the atmosphere when debris burns up			0
this debris itself is known as a meteoroid			0
most are so small they are vapourised in the atmosphere			0
if any of this meteoroid makes it to @entity0 , it is called a meteorite			0
@entity65 , meteoroids and meteorites normally originate from asteroids and comets			1
scrolling around the world , you can see where some of the biggest hotspots are			1
and it also highlights how vulnerable our planet is to asteroids			1
@entity14 estimates that just 1 per cent of the millions of asteroids in our solar system have been found			2
but , although you can see recorded impacts on land in these animations , most asteroids that encounter @entity0 either explode in the atmosphere or land at sea			1
this means the vast majority are unrecorded and , as we do n't know the location of every asteroid in the solar system , we 're not sure when one will next it			1
the potential for an asteroid to wipe out life on @entity0 has been highlighted recently by @entity14 and other agencies			2
in late april , an organisation of former astronauts known as the @entity100 announced that we are hit by asteroids more often than thought			2
they found 26 instances of explosions larger than nuclear bombs , mostly in the upper atmosphere , that had occurred since 2000			0
a previous map made by @entity7 ( above , click and hold to move ) shows the sizes of asteroid impacts around the world over about 4,000 years , although this map does not have the time - lapse functionality @entity114 in @entity115 , pictured , is the largest impact crater in the @entity117			1
it is 0.737 miles ( 1.186 kilometres ) across and is believed to be about 50,000 years old			2
it is thought to have been formed by a meteorite about 165 feet ( 50 metres ) in diameter this followed an announcement by @entity14 in march that they would begin crowdsourcing ideas to track and monitor asteroids			2
known as the @entity126 , the series of contests offer $ 35,000 in various awards to people who can develop algorithms to identify asteroids			2
last friday , the competition passed part of phase one ’s goal of developing an algorithm			0
422 from countries – from @entity139 to @entity140 – submitted their algorithms to @entity14			0
on 19 may the next phase of the contest takes place , tasking contestants with submitting their algorithms for analysis			0
@entity14 is planning a total of 10 contests this year			0
this illustration shows the approximate size comparisons of two asteroids			1
on the left is the estimated size of the meteorite that caused the @entity114 with a diameter of 165 feet ( 50 metres ) , while on the right is the @entity159 meteor with diameter of 55 feet ( 17 metres ) that fell over @entity162 last year ‘ for the past three years , @entity14 has been learning and advancing the ability to leverage distributed algorithm and coding skills through the @entity169 to solve tough problems , " the lab 's director , @entity163 , said in a statement			2
‘ we are now applying our experience with algorithm contests to helping protect the planet from asteroid threats through image analysis			1
’ the algorithms will not only identify asteroids but , it is hoped , discern their size and shape			2
this will enable @entity14 to decide if they pose a significant threat to @entity0 or not			0
according to the @entity100 , we need to detect city - killer asteroids decades in advance if we hope to deflect them away from our planet			1
methods of deflecting asteroids have not yet been tested , but using impactors to alter their trajectory or ‘ space tugs ’ to pull them out of @entity0 ’s path have been suggested .			0

data journalist @entity7 has created an interactive asteroid map
it shows the location of impacts around the world over the last *1,000* years
you can scroll and zoom around the world as the animation plays
another animation lets you see the sizes and location of impacts on a map
the animations highlight how vulnerable our planet is to asteroids
