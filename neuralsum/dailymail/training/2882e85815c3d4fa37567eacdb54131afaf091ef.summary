by @entity0 @entity1 screams ' pop legend ' before he even opens his mouth			1
for starters , there are the sideburns			1
huge things that stretch from his temples to his jowls and are coloured , like his hair , the deepest auburn			1
the dye job , he says , is the only thing ' i 've ever had done '			1
he looks , well ... how best to describe this showbiz demigod who 's sold more than 150 million albums , had a gazillion knickers hurled at him by besotted fans and turned 78 yesterday ? @entity1 has returned to the music scene once more with a new album called @entity24 with his fluffed - up mane , honey tan and huge frame , i think leonine best sums him up			1
and , boy , has he enjoyed the odd night on the prowl in his time			1
' i 've had more paternity suits than casual suits , ' he says matter - of - factly			1
there are claims he 's slept with 3,000 women			1
he says the number is lower , but i do n't think he was really keeping score			1
the only woman who 's ever truly mattered is his wife @entity37 , to whom he 's been married for 50 years			1
' my wife 's a wonderful lady , ' he says			1
' she 's put up with a lot but she 's very intelligent and knew deep down that , whatever i did , it was n't serious			1
she knew i always loved her more			1
' but i think being in showbusiness and having so many people giving themselves , i suppose i thought i was missing something			1
it was a part of growing up			1
i think my wife got hurt a lot , ' he admits			1
' i 've tried to make it up to her			1
i ring her three or four times a day - not because of guilt but because i want to talk			1
i 'd like her to travel with me more but she 's not been well			1
' @entity53 , as he asks me to call him ( ' that 's @entity53 as in @entity54 ' ) , looks genuinely sad when he says this			2
@entity1 and wife @entity56 his voice - which is part @entity58 where he spent a chunk of his 47 - year career after finding humungous fame with @entity63 in 1967 , and part @entity64 where he grew up and still has a huge 25 - acre estate complete with its own pub - wobbles			1
@entity53 adores his family , which includes six sisters , two brothers and four grown - up children of his own			1
one of the hardest - working men in showbusiness , he clocked up 65,000 miles on the road in the first three months of this year			2
i meet @entity53 before he appears on @entity76 's later … with @entity77			2
he 's as jumpy as a frog in a blender			2
' this show tonight is scaring me , ' he says			2
' i can go in front of thousands of people on stage and not be afraid , but when there 's just a few people , that scares me			2
' @entity53 is one of the least showbizzy showbusiness legends on the planet			2
so much so , you 'd struggle to find anyone with a bad word to say about him – apart , perhaps , from his old mate @entity92			2
@entity1 with @entity37 and their third daughter the two men , who used to be very close , fell out following the death of their former manager , @entity97 , from cancer 27 years ago			1
the pop legends were both discovered by @entity100 in the mid- 60s and became partners in the then huge @entity103 record label , until @entity53 decided to branch out on his own			1
' we have n't spoken since we lost our manager , ' he says			2
' @entity92 never forgave me for not staying with @entity97 , but i wanted to go off on my own because @entity97 was partial to him			2
so i have n't spoken to him for 27 years			2
i tried to make friends with him again but he just pooh - poohed it			2
i tried to say , " let bygones be bygones , " but he did n't want to know			2
he and his son ( @entity92 's manager @entity112 ) were as cold as ice , but i do n't mind the fact we do n't speak			2
' ' @entity92 never forgave me so i have n't spoken to him for 27 years			2
i tried to make friends with him again but he just pooh - poohed it ' indeed – @entity53 is n't short of friends			2
take the playlist of his new album of duets : @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 … it goes on and on			1
' it was listening to @entity124 's live album that gave us the idea			1
' ' @entity136 ' is he and his son @entity137 , now also his manager			2
' @entity124 introduces a song saying , " i wrote this many years ago when i was a struggling songwriter waiting for an @entity1 to come along and take a song like this			1
" so , we called him , asked him to do a duet on the album and he said yes			1
' when he came to @entity144 to record , we sat and talked for over an hour getting acquainted then he said , " come on			1
" he 's so professional and courteous			2
afterwards he sent me the biggest bunch of flowers you 've ever seen			2
' he duets with @entity127 on @entity150			0
' she 's been a part of my success - which is why i wanted to share this album with her , ' he says			1
@entity127 , it turns out , voted release me a hit on @entity159 back in 1967			0
' all the others voted it a miss , ' says @entity53			0
@entity1 received a shocking defeat at the @entity165 song contest in 2012 when he represented @entity166 this album , he says , has been a ' two - year labour of love ' following his shocking defeat at the @entity165 in which he came second to last after singing @entity171			1
it was , as he says , ' all political '			0
' when you 're drawn to sing first , as i was , you 're forgotten by the time the whole thing goes through			0
all i can tell you is it was political and it was disgusting			0
' does he regret appearing ? ' i thought it was a great honour to represent my country and i had a great song			0
the mere fact i lost was no reflection on me			0
' he 's had more gold and platinum discs in his career than most of us have had hot dinners			0
but it was n't until he was 30 that he got his ' lucky break ' with @entity63 , when he got a chance to perform the song , which had been released on 13 january , 1967 , in a show at the @entity195 , replacing singer @entity196 who 'd fallen ill. ' the record did n't move for three months , ' he says , ' until i got a shot at the @entity195			1
the very next day it started selling 80,000 a day , 90,000 and then it went to 127,000 a day			0
' he went to the @entity201 and appeared on the @entity202			0
he says @entity203 ' promoted you in such a way you ca n't not be successful			0
@entity206 , @entity207 , the @entity208 – they all went on his show and became huge stars			0
suddenly i was appearing with people i 'd heard singing as a little boy , like @entity213			0
@entity1 describes @entity214 as his ' twin ' ' i remember him standing in front of me , rehearsing with his pipe in his mouth – this legend , looking at me			1
when i finished he took his pipe out and said , " that 's some set of pipes you 've got there , boy			0
" ' @entity53 sparkles when he says this , much as he does when he speaks about his old muckers @entity228 ( ' he always called me @entity229			0
i loved him very much ' )			0
@entity230 ( ' he bought @entity231 off my manager			0
i 'd already recorded it but it did n't belong to me any more			0
i heard he paid a lot of money for it			0
i knew @entity230 very well but i did n't like his ethics – stealing my song ' ) and @entity206 ( ' i saw him three months prior to his death and knew he was troubled , but he was such a big star i felt inadequate to give him advice as a friend			0
i could see the grey in his face and i could see he was losing it			0
i later heard he used to speak of me as the twin brother he lost at birth			0
i thought that was quite a statement			0
' ) back in the days before plain @entity1 had changed his name to the rather preposterous - sounding @entity1 , @entity53 was ca n't - afford - a - packet - of - peanuts - let - alone - a - pint poor			1
' i used to walk past the pub and smell the beer instead of walking in and being able to buy half a pint , ' he says			0
' those were hard years			0
there was a lot of starvation			0
i went three or four days without food			0
' now he can eat what he wants , with a fortune of over £ 65 million having invested wisely in ' bricks and mortar for my children '			0
but he 's never stopped working for it			0
' sometimes now i 'll be about to go on stage and there 's 10,000 people out there and i 'll say to myself , " @entity268 , i do n't feel like it tonight			0
" then they call your name , you walk out and you just come to life			0
my job is to entertain people and make them happy			0
i 'm blessed to be able to do that			0
' he could , he says , ' keep chatting for hours ' but he must prepare himself for the @entity77 show , which he decides to do at the bar with a big glass of wine			0
like i say , @entity1 ( ' i like the name @entity1			1
it 's unusual , ' he says			0
' but @entity1 ? not so much ' ) is a 24 - carat pop legend			1
the duets album @entity290 is out now			1
