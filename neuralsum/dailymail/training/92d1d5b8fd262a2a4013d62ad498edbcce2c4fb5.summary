by @entity0 published : 05:48 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 01:04 est , 23 april 2013 when dinnertime arrives on the sun - scorched savannah of @entity5 's @entity4 , you either fight for your life or your livelihood ... but it does n't always go according to plan			1
as this incredible series of photographs show , there is one kind of free dinner that likes being free , and will fight hoof and tail to keep it that way			2
so when @entity20 the cheetah tried to hunt down a young wildebeest , the plucky calf stood its ground and gave the predator a nasty surprise			1
tables turned : as this incredible series of photographs show , there is one kind of free dinner that likes being free , and will fight hoof and tail to keep it that way charge : the cheetah dodges the wildebeest 's horns as it lunges in the long grass easy target ? the wildebeest calf was slightly slower than the rest of the adult wildebeest and looked like an easy target the images , taken by @entity42 photographer @entity41 , show the wildebeest fought back sending the cheetah running from its horns			1
the cheetah - named @entity20 by local guides - had been tracked for several days by @entity41 's party studying her hunting habits			1
@entity41 said : ' the cheetah mother @entity20 had to hunt every day or two to feed herself and the fast growing cub			1
' i was taking her pictures as she was seated with the cub on a termite mound			0
by being on top of the mound the cheetah could scan the vast savanna grassland and easily spot any prey			0
attack : moving at top speed , the cheetah caught up with the wildebeest calf and put her front two feet on the wildebeests back , trying to bring it down hanging on : she tried to hold on to the wildebeest as it thrashed about trying to break free ferocious : the young wildebeest turns , dips its horns and charges at the unsuspecting cheetah in a last - ditch bid to save its own life ' this was necessary because the grass was taller than the cheetah 's height and therefore she had to be taller than the grass by climbing on top of a mound			1
' while on the mound , the cheetah - with a much more powerful eyesight than humans - noticed a line of wildebeest moving across the grassland			2
i was using binoculars all the time			0
' she quickly left the cub on the mound and started walking fast to the line of the wildebeest			0
her walk turned into a fast sprint at at approximate distance of 100 metres from the wildebeest group			0
' tussle : an almighty tussle broke out between the two as the wildebeest fought for its life and the cheetah its livelihood wild frenzy : the pair circled each other , locked in battle , as - for a brief moment - the hunted became the hunter victory : incredibly , the cheetah ends up giving up the chase and running away @entity41 said the cheetah quickly singled out a potential target			1
he said : ' cheetahs are known to reach a speed of about 100 kmph in a few seconds			0
' the wildebeest started running on spotting the fast encroaching cheetah			2
the wildebeest calf was slightly slower than the rest of the adult wildebeest and became an easy target			0
' moving at top speed , the cheetah caught up with the wildebeest calf and put her front two feet on the wildebeests back , trying to bring it down			2
snapper : the pictures were taken by @entity42 photographer @entity41 who had been tracking the cheetah for several days , studying her hunting habits majestic : @entity41 was taking her pictures as she was seated with the cub on a termite mound			1
by being on top of the mound the cheetah could scan the vast savanna grassland and easily spot any prey ' but the wildebeest calf was brave and a strong fighter			2
it could not be brought down but instead it turned to face the cheetah , throwing off the cheetah on the ground			0
' the wildebeest calf then charged with its horns and the scared the cheetah ran off			1
being at a slight disadvantage the cheetah did not want to get injured as her cub was totally dependent on her hunting skills			0
so she let the wildebeest go			0

the series of photographs were taken by @entity42 photographer @entity41 in @entity5 's @entity4
he had been tracking @entity20 the cheetah for several days when he saw her chase down a young wildebeest
but the wildebeest *refused* to lie down and fought back in a ferocious fight for life and livelihood
after ten minutes of fierce fighting , the wildebeest charged with its horns and the scared the cheetah ran off
