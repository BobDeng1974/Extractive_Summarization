resembling a full - sized hula hoop with one of the label 's classic 2.55 bags stitched awkwardly across the bottom of it , the bags first appeared slung over models ' shoulders on the spring / summer 2013 catwalk during fashion week			1
they were instantly dismissed by fashion editors as a stunt by the publicity - hungry house ( famous for freezing a giant iceberg in the middle of the catwalk and staging a threesome between models in previous years ) which would never go into production			0
@entity33 's mother @entity31 trying on the enormous @entity7 hula hoop bag for size in @entity37 's @entity36 's that was until the bags resurfaced this week on sale at @entity37 's @entity36 's - where they were being eyed up by reality star and mother of the infamous @entity33 , @entity31			1
they 've also been spotted being sported by a @entity46 fashion editor and various style bloggers at other fashion weeks			0
so who on earth would want something so cumbersome , ridiculous and expensive ( the bags start at £ 1,500 for a 24cm across version ) - other than , of course , the fashion pack or egomaniacal reality stars looking to attract some column inches ? luckily , @entity7 head designer @entity58 provides an answer as to where this bag might be appropriate : ' it 's for the beach , ' he explained after his show in the @entity64 in @entity65 , to rapturous crowds			1
' you need space for the beach towel			0
and then you can put it into the sand and hang things on it			0
' yes , this bag is nothing less than a designer drying rack and towel holder			0
perhaps this really is one hula hoop it might be better not to take for a spin			2
