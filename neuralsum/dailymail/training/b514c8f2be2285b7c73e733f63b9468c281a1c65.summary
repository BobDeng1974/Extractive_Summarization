temperatures are expected to remain low until next week , when a low - pressure system from the @entity16 could bring some ' slightly less - cold air '			1
@entity48 , a forecaster with @entity49 , said saturday will generally feel less cold as the winds become lighter , although there could be wintry showers in the @entity53			2
a slight change however could be just around the corner next week			1
mr @entity48 said : ' there 's a lot of uncertainty with times at the moment , but there seems to be a low pressure system from the @entity16 which is going to try and feed in some slightly less - cold air to the @entity63			1

' forecasts have also suggested things could return to more like what would be expected in april by the end of next week			1
mr @entity48 said : ' looking five or six days ahead from now , towards the end of next week , temperatures could be returning towards average , but nothing particularly warm			1
' going somewhere nice ? passengers brave snow showers at @entity34 at @entity35 as @entity63 will soon feel that spring is on its way with the news that it is about to get warmer change around the corner ? temperatures are expected to get as warm as @entity47 next week leaving the cold : passengers at the @entity34 departure area at @entity35 radar : a map of the country which shows the area of sleet and snow making its way over the @entity5 today a spring flower show held for 138 years had to be cancelled in @entity30 yesterday as snow fell across the county			1
@entity132 and @entity133 announced the continuous freezing weather had resulted in no entries in the tulips and camellias categories			2

it has been so cold that so many flower classes will have nothing in them such as the tulips , camellias and spring flowers			0
' nothing has come into flower yet as well as very few daffodils			0
' i often enter the majority of the 40 or so flower classes but this year i would be hard pressed to enter six classes and it seems most of our members are having the same problem			0
' meanwhile , wintry showers and sub-zero temperatures affected most parts of @entity30			1
major roads such as the @entity28 and @entity189 were hit by the snow which settled in some places			2

more than 5,000 @entity63 could have died last month because of the freezing weather , it was feared today			0
new figures from the @entity243 reveal that , in the first three weeks of last month , 4,206 more deaths than usual were recorded			0
a further 1,000 extra deaths are expected to have been recorded for the final week of the month - lifting the march total to 5,000 more than normal			1
it is believed that the freezing temperatures and snow could be partly to blame for these extra deaths - which were mainly among older people			1
a rise in flu cases could also be partly responsible			0
the overall death toll in the first three weeks of march was 33,500 , compared with a previous average of 29,294 for the past five years			0
a @entity257 spokeswoman said the full details about cold weather deaths would not be made available by the government until october - giving statisticians time to make a detailed study			2
she said : ' we are concerned to see an increase in deaths , but these figures are provisional and should be treated with caution			0
' she added that an extra £ 330million had been made available this winter for the @entity268 and social care			0
the greatest rise in deaths came during the third week of march when the death toll was 1,600 higher than normal at 11,075			1
@entity274 health minister @entity273 said : ' when winter weather bites , we have all got a responsibility to look in on older neighbours and relatives			0
' older people need to keep warm but soaring gas and electricity prices are making this harder than it should be			0
' mr @entity273 said that social services were struggling after more than £ 1.3billion was cut from town hall budgets for care of the elderly			0
