judges have caused controversy by ordering that the parents of nine children involved in plots to travel to @entity5 should have their identities hidden			1
they include three terror suspects who have all previously been named but now can not be identified to protect their youngsters from the glare of publicity			1
also among the parents are a couple who lied to the authorities about losing their daughter ’s passport			1
one case involves a family of nine @entity31 – three men , two women and four children aged between one and 11 – who were caught trying to get into lawless @entity5 from @entity35 last week			1
the group , from @entity37 , were led by 21 - year - old politics undergraduate @entity20 , the son of @entity21 – a respected @entity22 councillor who was photographed with @entity40 just months ago			0
anonymity orders were granted to shield the children from the glare of publicity			2
but the draconian orders mean three of the adults must also have their identities hidden even though they are terror suspects			1
in a separate case , the @entity48 banned the naming of five girls , aged 15 and 16 , who had their passports confiscated after they showed an interest in @entity56 extremism			0
four attended @entity57 in @entity58 while the fifth is home schooled			0
counter-terrorism police have taken over the probe into the shooting of a @entity5 imam in @entity58 amid fears he was murdered by a professional hit squad			1
@entity67 , a fierce critic of @entity5 leader @entity68 , was gunned down in @entity69 as he sat in his car			1
@entity72 ’s homicide and @entity73 was leading the probe but counter-terrorism officers have taken over due to its potential ‘ international dimensions ’			0
they are understood to be examining his links to groups which oppose the @entity5 regime			1
the girls were granted anonymity because they were juveniles			0
but this means the identities of their parents must also be hidden behind a cloak of secrecy			2
these include the couple who lied to the authorities about their daughter ’s passport			2
police and social services had sought to seize it because they were concerned the teenager had been radicalised			0
counter-terrorism officers wanted to ensure she did not follow in the footsteps of four other pupils from the school – @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 – who ran away to join @entity108			0
but when approached by police , social workers and teachers , her mother and father insisted the passport had disappeared and , in any case , had expired			0
later , police discovered the girl ’s passport remained valid until 2016			0
a high court judge said the failure to disclose the truth was ‘ manifestly highly relevant ’ in the decision to impose a travel ban on the vulnerable child			2
mr @entity125 , sitting in the family division of the @entity48 , said : ‘ i have no doubt that misinformation about [ the girl ’s ] passport had been given to the school , the police and to the social services , a fact which plainly is relevant in evaluating the matrix of risk			0
’ lured to jihad : @entity104 , 16 , left , @entity105 , 15 , centre , and @entity106 , 15 , right , at @entity138 he said the parents ‘ deliberately did not share [ information ] with the authorities ’			2
@entity143 , a research fellow for security think - tank the @entity145 , said granting anonymity to the three @entity37 terror suspects was ‘ like trying to put a cat back in a bag ’ as they had previously been named			1
but she said the @entity152 schoolgirls should not be named because ‘ the stigma will stay with them forever ’			2
she also suggested the parents of one girl lied because of the malign influence of radical extremists and their apologists such as @entity162 human rights group @entity160 , which supported @entity108 killer @entity163			1
‘ these groups foment a belief within the @entity166 , whether out of ignorance or malice , that they should be fearful of the police , of the @entity171 , of counter-terrorism policies , and should not co-operate , ’ she said			0

parents of nine children involved in plots to travel to @entity5 are affected
they include three terror suspects who have all previously been named
critics argue parents should be named because they could be extremists
