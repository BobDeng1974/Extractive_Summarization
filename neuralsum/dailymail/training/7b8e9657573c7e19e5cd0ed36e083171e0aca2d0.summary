move aside @entity0 , there ’s a new coffin car in town – and it ’s powered by a jet engine			1
@entity6 inventor @entity5 gave the @entity8 coffin car - made famous in the 1960s children ’s tv show @entity7 - a 21st century facelift by adding two pulse jets			1
the engine in the @entity14 weighs 300lbs and can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in nine seconds – faster than a @entity15			2
it is made of wood and the undercarriage consists of steel tubing with a @entity23 under the seat			2
during tests , @entity5 reached speeds of 60mph but does n't ' dare ' go faster a pulsejet engine is a type of engine in which the combustion happens in loud pulses and is fired by jets			1
they can be made with few or no moving parts and can ignite a mixture of air with the majority of fuels available			0
pulsejets are more commonly used in drones , for flying control line and radio - controlled aircraft as well as industrial drying and home heating equipment			0
the engines convert fuel into heat , making them perfect for boilers , for example			0
@entity51 has a proprietary pulse jet engine technology called @entity53 ( @entity53 ) , and plans to use pulse jet engines to lift military and commercial aircraft vertically from a standing position			2
@entity5 specialises in creating vehicles powered by pulsejet engines , and sells plans to his designs as well parts on his website			1
previous inventions include the @entity65 jet skateboard and the jet - powered @entity67 bicycle			0
‘ it ’s definitely the only jet - powered coffin car in the world , powered by pulse jets – i ’ve never seen another one like it , ’ explained @entity5			1
he added he drove the car up to 60mph but did n't ' dare ' to go faster , admitting he had trouble breathing when driving it			1
the coffin is made of wood , the undercarriage is steel tubing with a @entity23 that has been bent to go under the seat			0
the front end is a 34 @entity84 drop axle and the coffin has a five gallon air tank			0
while the cockpit features three switches ; the left - hand switch turns the spark air on and the other two switches control the ‘ snake venom ’ fuel that powers the engines			0
' i remembered seeing a schematic of a pulsejet in an encyclopedia when i was a teenager and that is where i started , but there was n’t anyone to copy so i ended up re-inventing a lot , ' @entity5 told @entity104			1
@entity5 designed his coffin car after being inspired by @entity0 's @entity8 vehicle , pictured , made famous in the 1960s children 's tv show the @entity7 @entity0 , pictured , was played in the tv show by @entity110			1
the original model of the @entity8 , pictured , featured a 350 horsepower , @entity113 v8 engine he continued he had been fascinated by the possibility of creating a coffin car since he was a child : ' i actually grew up on top of old graveyard hill in @entity120 , @entity6 and had graves right under by bed			1
' the old cemetery was supposed to have been moved to the new cemetery in 1900 , but back then if there were no living kin they would just move the head stone not the coffin			0
when i was little my @entity130 dug a swimming pool and hit four graves			0
' ' i always loved @entity7 , @entity133 and @entity134 - naturally since i was known as the kid that lived on graveyard hill - and always wanted a coffin car like @entity0 built			1
' @entity5 's coffin car took a month to build and cost $ 1,300 ( £ 814 )			1
the coffin car can go from 0 to 60 in nine seconds			2
@entity5 , pictured , said he did n't ' dare ' to go faster than , admitting he had trouble breathing while driving it but added it was ' way fun ' the coffin car , pictured here with inventor @entity5 , took a month to build and cost $ 1,300 ( £ 814 )			1

the @entity14 is reminiscent of the @entity185 which , along with the @entity186 , were the main vehicles used by @entity7			0
the original model featured a 350 horsepower , @entity113 v8 engine .			2

the @entity191 is fitted with a 300lb pulsejet thrust engine
during tests , @entity6 inventor @entity5 drove at speeds up to 60mph
it was inspired by @entity0 's @entity8 car in the children 's tv show
the design took a month to build and cost @entity5 $ 1,300 ( £ 814 )
