by @entity0 hugging a giant block of ice may seem a bizarre way to bring good fortune to your new year , but at least these men from @entity7 can console themselves with the thought that it ca n't get much worse			1
in in @entity10 yesterday around 100 people took part in the ancient @entity13 festival of @entity14 , a winter purification ritual that is supposed to cleanse the body and soul and bring them closer to mystical spirits which they believe can bring them success			1
in temperatures of just @entity23 ( @entity24 ) these men stripped down to loincloths and headbands before taking a dip in the freezing water of the pool at @entity31 shrine while crouching down in order to pray			1
@entity31 is less of a religion and more of a way of life , and followers perform many rituals designed to please kame - meaning spirits or powers			2
this particular shrine is dedicated to @entity67 , one of the most important kame who brings success , prosperity and fertility			0
despite their obvious suffering in these pictures , followers of @entity31 believe that the spirits want humans to be happy and are willing to help them if they are treated correctly			1
around 100 followers took part in the ceremony which is celebrated all over @entity7 , but usually just involves washing in cold water the temple seen here is dedicated to @entity67 , one of the main kame of @entity31 , who can bring people prosperity , success and fertility @entity31 is more of a way of life , rather than a religion , as it has no commandments , no @entity92 , no founder and allows people to follow other beliefs desite this man 's suffering , @entity96 teaches that humans are essentially good and that the spirits that watch over them love them and want them to succeed @entity31 has no @entity92 or @entity101 , no founder , no central commandments and allows people to follow other religions			1
instead it teaches ethical principles and a love of oneself			0
@entity31 , which translates as ' way of the spirits ' , is intricately linked with the geography of @entity7 , and so is rarely practiced outside of the country			2
purity is at the heart of @entity31 's understanding of good and evil			0
pollution - tsumi - can be physical , moral or spiritual			0
being pure is incredibly important to believers of @entity31 , though their equivalent of sin - tsumi - is usually caused by things outside of people 's control , rather than people themselves @entity31 means ' way of the spirits ' and is seldom worshipped outside of @entity7 because of its very strong link with the @entity7 landscape other purity rituals in @entity13 can involve going long periods without sleep , breathing exercises , standing under waterfalls and other balance training the ritual also helps to keep the participants physically fit and tests their endurance @entity139 means much the same as the @entity141 word ' sin ' , but it differs from sin in that it includes things which are beyond the control of individual human beings and are thought of as being caused by evil spirits			2
in ancient @entity13 , tsumi also included disease , disaster and error			0
anything connected with death or the dead is considered particularly polluting .			0
