by @entity0 published : 10:53 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 11:15 est , 11 september 2012 stylish , sleek and impressive audio output - start - up company @entity2 have created a worthy addition to the headphone market			1
the two models tested were the @entity6 , priced at £ 89.99 and the @entity7 , coming in at £ 29.99			2
at first glance , both have distinct styling clearly catering for very different audiences			1
sound investment : djpros are built to last the @entity6 , as the name suggests , would n't look out of place hugging the ears of some of the world 's top djs			1
their chunky look is designed to catch the eye , while clever details like the coiled wire at the bottom , give the impression they could be slotted straight into a turntable			2
although their brushed - metal effect is heavy - looking , the @entity27 are surprisingly light - weight			1
they are easily adjustable , too , with comfortable , padded speakers that rest snugly on your head			0
audio quality is on par with their aesthetics			1
depth of sound is strong and noise reduction is effective			0
purists may find the bass not quite ' deep ' enough for headphones of this nature , but there 's enough there for most to enjoy			0
musical detail , in particular , is on par with headphones twice the price			0
moving on to the @entity51			0
these have a very different feel to the @entity54 - catering to a much wider audience			1
and although the @entity51 may be the entry - level offering of @entity2 headphones , there 's nothing to suggest the company have let quality drop			1
it 's a simpler design than the @entity63 , one more suited to compliment most outfits rather than be a statement piece			0
its looks are simple enough to be an attractive buy for teenagers and for younger children , while retaining a playful feel which will resonate with many adults			0
queen of cool : the @entity74 compliment most outfits and boast strong audio quality sound quality is strong , although it 's slightly more ' tinny ' than the @entity78			1
there 's a slight lack of low - end punch in the bass , but trebles are crisp and clean , allowing clear instrument distinction			2
for the price , very few that can match them			0
roots may be new to the audio market but are clearly in tune with what consumers want			2
whatever pair you go for , both are brilliant value for money and a sound investment for years to come			2
follow @entity0 on @entity99 : @ @entity100 and on @entity101 : @entity102 .			0

distinct styling and brilliant audio quality
@entity107 , in particular , are the perfect *accessory* for men and women of all ages
@entity78 would n't look out of place on world - class @entity114 , but are more *expensive*
