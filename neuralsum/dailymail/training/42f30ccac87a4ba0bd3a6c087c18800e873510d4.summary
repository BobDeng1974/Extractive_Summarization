by @entity0 published : 08:39 est , 19 december 2012 updated : 03:06 est , 20 december 2012 lawyers for @entity2 will try to convince an appeals court not to double his five - year sentence his conviction for drug dealing two years ago sealed his status as the black sheep of the @entity2 acting dynasty			1
and , sadly , it seems jail has done little to improve matters for @entity2 , son of @entity13 and grandson of @entity15			2
yesterday a @entity17 court heard how he had persuaded his besotted defence lawyer to smuggle drugs to him , hidden in her bra			0
the 34 - year - old admitted he had shared the drugs with other inmates , and had also smoked cigarettes , gambled , snorted substances and committed other infractions while in prison			1
following these offences , a judge doubled his original five - year sentence to ten			1
the appalling history and extent of @entity2 ’s drug problems were revealed as his legal team returned to court to appeal against that decision			1
it came just a few days after @entity2 reportedly suffered a broken leg and finger in a prison attack			1
papers submitted to the appeals court revealed that @entity2 had persuaded his defence lawyer to sneak drugs into prison in her bra on at least three or four occasions			1
@entity48 , 33 , put contraband @entity50 anti-anxiety pills inside a balloon , which she slipped inside her underwear			1
@entity2 ’s current lawyer , @entity54 , said she ‘ apparently became enamoured of @entity2 during frequent visits ’			1
judge @entity56 , who extended @entity2 ’s original sentence , said he had never ‘ encountered a defendant who has so recklessly and wantonly and flagrantly and criminally acted in as destructive and ( as ) manipulative a fashion as @entity2 has ’			1
but mr @entity54 called the additional five years ‘ shockingly long ’ and said it ‘ may be the harshest sentence ever imposed on a federal prisoner for a drug possession offence ’			2
he also blamed his client ’s long history of substance abuse on a lack of parental support when he was growing up			0
‘ while still a young teenager , he drank heavily and began selling drugs , ’ mr @entity54 said			0
‘ he used illegal drugs to self - medicate – to ward off depression and panic attacks			0
’ before his conviction @entity2 , the only child of @entity76 ’s first marriage to @entity77 , had been arrested several times over drugs but never prosecuted			2
@entity76 , pictured in 2002 with son @entity2 , has previously said that he thought prison might be a good thing for his troubled son @entity76 , pictured in 2009 , with son @entity2 who has suffered a broken leg and fingers after being attacked in prison but in july 2009 he was held in a @entity86 hotel and accused of distributing and conspiring to distribute more than 4.5 kilograms of methamphetamine and 20 kilograms of cocaine over the previous three years			1
at the time , he was so visibly high on heroin that he had to be taken to hospital before he could go to court			0
it later emerged he had been injecting himself with heroin five or six times a day for the past five years , according to the new court papers			0
he was released from custody on the condition that he remain under house arrest with a private security guard			0
but within days , he persuaded his girlfriend , @entity99 , to smuggle him heroin hidden inside an electric toothbrush			0
his bail was revoked and he was sent to prison			0
he admitted narcotics distribution charges and was jailed for five years , avoiding a mandatory ten - year sentence by cooperating with investigators			1
two drug suppliers were arrested and convicted as a result of his information and @entity2 testified at the trial of one			1
this reportedly led to the attack this week , which is said to have happened during a prison game of @entity114			0
@entity2 is serving time at @entity115 in @entity116 ( left )			2
( @entity117 ) pictured partying in 2004 mobsters allegedly put a $ 100 ( £ 60 ) bounty on @entity2 for being a ‘ rat ’			2
at the original sentencing , judge @entity121 noted that @entity2 ’s family had tried to help him , but he had refused , and that two decades of drug addiction treatment had been unsuccessful			1
incarceration , the judge noted , had produced the longest period of sobriety @entity2 had ever known since he was 13			1
but in fact he was still getting hold of drugs while behind bars , prosecutors said			0
in the court papers , it emerged that @entity2 – who had roles in four minor films – began using intravenous cocaine at the age of 20			2
he swiftly moved on to heroin and , by the time he was 25 , ‘ his life revolved around [ the drug ] ’ , mr @entity54 said			0
his friends were fellow users who gravitated to him because of his access to family money , which supported their habits , the lawyer said			0
he added that @entity2 ’s ‘ exasperated ’ father cut off his son ’s allowance when he refused to go into rehab , forcing @entity2 to turn to drug dealing to pay for his habit			1
mr @entity54 argued that the judge had gone too far with @entity2 , punishing an addict for something beyond his control			2
‘ while we recognise that many of the words that the district court used to describe @entity2 ’s conduct – “ reckless ” , “ manipulative ” , “ destructive ” – were apt , the simple truth is that @entity2 is a heroin addict who has yet to shake his habit , ’ he said			0
his 68 - year - old father has previously said he had a strained relationship for many years with his own father , @entity15 , and acknowledged that he may have repeated that pattern with @entity168			1
‘ @entity15 was all - consumed , was overworked			0
probably like myself at a certain time in my life , ’ he said			0
@entity76 and his ex-wife , @entity77 , leave the @entity172 after their son @entity2 was sentenced to five years in prison in 2010			2

judge doubles his five - year sentence because of prison drug crimes
his lawyers appeal decision and blame ' a lack of parenting '
he was brought @entity50 pills by his lawyer - turned - lover
@entity176 said he *'d* never met a defendant with as much *disrespect* as @entity2
