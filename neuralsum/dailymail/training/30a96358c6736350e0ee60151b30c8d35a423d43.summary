by @entity0 published : 10:42 est , 3 march 2013 updated : 11:52 est , 3 march 2013 rosie the labrador was lucky to survive after impaling her head on a stick jutting up from the ground as she chased a ball			2
@entity7 , 62 , and @entity8 , 56 , who are both retired , were walking the eight - year - old @entity10 cross sunday afternoon when @entity11 got herself into the sticky situation			1
@entity11 was playing in a field close to the couple 's home in @entity16 , @entity17 and ran to fetch a ball			1
but instead her attention was grabbed by a foot - long stick poking out of the ground and the pet playfully pounced on it			2
freak accident : @entity11 the dog was racing to get a ball and somehow managed to get impaled on a stick ( outlined in red ) horrifyingly , the stick impaled her underneath her tongue and plunged down her throat			1
ms @entity7 , a grandmother of two , said : ' @entity11 had lost sight of a ball we had thrown for her			1
she then noticed a long stick , which was stuck in the ground at a 45 degree angle , and pounced on it			2
' i quickly realised that she was impaled on the stick so i ran to her and wrenched it out of the ground to free her			0
' the couple contacted @entity42 and rushed her straight to their surgery in @entity45			0
bit more than a twig : the stick after it was recovered from the unfortunate dog 's throat ' it took us 30 minutes to drive to @entity45 and @entity11 was obviously in a lot of pain because the stick was three inches wide and a foot long , " said @entity7 , who worked as a freelance writer , a part - time teacher and managed a furniture shop before she retired			1
' @entity11 is such a lovely natured dog and the vets could n't believe it when she greeted them with a wagging tail			1
' vet @entity61 said : ' we anaesthetised @entity11 so that we could take x-rays and assess the damage			1
' we operated on her immediately to remove the stick , which was over a foot long , and stitched the wound under her tongue where the stick had gone in			1
' @entity11 has been very lucky because she could have damaged the muscles that are responsible for swallowing and could also have had complications from infection and splinters			1
' we kept her in for two days and put her on antibiotics and pain relief and she has now made a good recovery			0
' ms @entity7 added : ' since the incident @entity11 has made an excellent recovery			1
the swelling on her neck is almost gone and she 's back to her old self			0
' we have taken to calling her ' the black shadow ' since it happened because she keeps following us everywhere			0
i think it has left her a little shaken and she keeps pining for us			0
' she 's not a young dog but she acts like a puppy and is daft as a brush			0
at one point it was touch and go and i just ca n't imagine what life would be like without her			0
@entity8 ( pictured ) and his @entity7 care for the eight - year - old @entity10 cross for ms @entity7 's daughter @entity98 ' my daughter , @entity98 , owned her from when she was a puppy but since last october she 's lived with me and @entity8 because @entity98 has been really busy with work			0
she 's part of the family and we 're delighted she 's made a full recovery			0
' she added : ' i ca n't praise @entity42 enough			0
they had a team ready for us as soon as we got there and they gave us updates on @entity11 's progress every couple of hours			2
' they were so compassionate and if it was n't for them , i 'm not sure @entity11 would have made it			2

the *unlucky* *animal* *jumped* onto the stick while out for a walk
*terrifyingly* , it *pierced* her tongue and went down her throat
owners rushed @entity11 to a vet and she is now shaken but recovering well
