@entity1 's humiliation of their noisy neighbours @entity2 at @entity3 led the club 's official website to claim the city was turned red once more in the space of 90 minutes			1
yet was this the case ? was that 4 - 2 win a sign that @entity1 are the dominant force in @entity11 again , or should we just chalk it off as nothing more than a bad game for the defending champions ? @entity2 had , after all , beaten @entity1 four consecutive times going into the derby , so should the red half of @entity11 be so confident sitting four points ahead ? here is @entity22 's verdict on the issues			1
is @entity11 red again ? of course not , it is neither red or blue			1
@entity1 ’s website declared this to be the case and they will rightly revel in sunday ’s victory for a while			1
what perhaps best sums up @entity2 ’s current plight , meanwhile , is that they have been dragged back in to this parochial little squabble at all			2
@entity35 and his players began this season with aspirations of defending their @entity40 title and making an impact on the @entity42			0
@entity1 's players celebrate together during the derby win for the red half of the city @entity47 salutes the @entity3 crowd while @entity49 and @entity50 celebrate his goal with @entity1 setting their own sights no higher than a return to the top four , the club from the other side of town were the least of their worries			1
yet here we are in april with @entity2 already being lapped by league leaders @entity60 and @entity1 now easing away from them in third			1
it ’s a remarkable state of affairs even if a look at the fixture list does offer @entity2 some semblance of hope			2
@entity1 ’s next two games are at @entity60 and @entity67 , and they still have a home fixture with @entity69 and a visit to @entity71 to follow			2
@entity2 , on the other hand , have four home games you would expect them to win and away matches at @entity76 and @entity77			2
can @entity2 take maximum points between now and the end of the season ? in theory they could but that would take some doing from a team that looks to be on the floor			2
at the @entity85 they spoke of ‘ trajectory ’ the day they hustled @entity87 out of the door in 2009 and it is a word that neatly works to sum up the differences between red and blue			0
apr 18 - @entity60 ( a ) apr 26 - @entity67 ( a ) may 2 - @entity92 ( h ) may 9 - @entity71 ( a ) may 17 - @entity69 ( h ) may 24 - @entity2 ( a ) apr 19 - @entity95 ( h ) apr 25 - @entity97 ( h ) may 3 - @entity76 ( a ) may 10 - @entity99 ( h ) may 17 - @entity77 ( a ) may 24 - @entity101 ( h ) @entity1 won the battle against @entity2 but the war is still ongoing with six @entity40 games remaining @entity1 manager @entity106 thanked supporters for their patience after sunday 's victory why do @entity1 suddenly look like a good team again ? their manager @entity106 has not been too proud to learn from his mistakes			1
he was the only person in @entity11 , for example , who thought that @entity50 was a central midfielder and @entity115 a substitute			2
eventually he recognised his folly and @entity1 have improved			2
@entity118 has also had the courage to pick players on form not reputation			2
this is why we now see @entity125 on the bench , @entity127 playing ahead of the expensive @entity128 – regardless of @entity128 ’s recent injury – and @entity47 ahead of @entity130			0
at times , @entity118 ’s hand has been forced by injuries but his faith in players such as @entity49 and @entity136 – players whose @entity3 career looked over during pre-season – has its roots in what he has seen on the training field			1
in many ways , this @entity1 team now resembles his @entity144 team of the @entity145			2
it seems to lack depth and real quality but still it manages to get the job done			0
@entity47 runs away in celebration after scoring one of @entity1 's four goals against their great rivals @entity2 @entity50 , @entity49 and @entity47 celebrate as they all rightfully earn their first - team places for @entity1 @entity130 ( third right ) and @entity125 ( right ) were left out of the starting xi by @entity118 on sunday what has been the secret behind the renaissance of players like @entity49 and @entity162 ? @entity118 is a coach ’s coach who believes in the value of the training ground			1
a man who swears by systems and training ground drills , the @entity1 manager has followed a mantra of ‘ repeat , repeat , repeat ’ ever since he arrived in @entity11 and , at last , it has paid off			1
in his early days at the club some of the @entity1 players worried that their new manager ’s love of endless passing drills would eventually bore them to death			2
some even thought they were contributing to the squad ’s spate of muscle injuries			0
over time , however , @entity118 ’s belief in the value of repetition has worked and players like @entity49 , @entity162 and indeed central defender @entity186 have particularly benefited			2
@entity1 do not play predictable football but it is a game hung very firmly to a structure			0
that is one of the reasons why , for example , a back four without a single stellar player has conceded fewer goals than everybody bar @entity60 and @entity101 this season			0
@entity162 celebrates scoring in this brilliant photograph taken by @entity22 snapper @entity198 @entity49 celebrates after bringing @entity1 level having earlier trailed against @entity2 from the eighth minute players once moaned about , such as @entity162 and @entity49 , are now pivotal parts of @entity1 's team @entity118 ’s belief in the value of repetition has worked and players like @entity49 and @entity162 have benefited did n't @entity106 consider selling @entity162 last summer ? yes , he did			1
oddly , it was only an injury that prevented the @entity207 joining @entity208 in loan last august but again @entity118 ’s treatment of @entity162 has illustrated the value of flexibility and objectivity when it comes to managing players and teams			0
@entity118 certainly has an ego but it is n’t allowed to get in the way of decision making			0
he began the season convinced that 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 was the way forward for this @entity1 team and certainly there would have been no room for @entity162 in that system			1
but time – not to mention performances – persuaded @entity118 that there was greater value in other methods			0
at @entity2 , @entity35 has been rather more stubborn			0
over the course of the season the @entity231 has refused to recognise the problems of using @entity235 as part of a central midfield pair and indeed the fact that his favoured 4 - 4 - 2 system can lead to his side being overrun in the middle of the field against really good teams			1
@entity162 helped as @entity1 tore @entity2 apart at @entity3 to move four points clear of their noisy neighbours @entity162 has illustrated the value of flexibility and objectivity when it comes to managing players and teams it was only an injury that prevented @entity162 from joining @entity208 in loan last august from @entity1 should @entity35 be worried about his position at @entity2 ? @entity254 lost by @entity2 in 2015 , one more than the whole of 2014			1
13 - @entity2 's position in the @entity40 form table after losing four and winning two of their last six			1
4 - the first time since losing 4 - 3 to @entity1 in 2009 that @entity2 have conceded four in the league			1
9 - @entity2 have nine points fewer than they did at this stage last season			1
70.8 - @entity2 's pass completion rate percentage at @entity3 was their worst of the season			1
as has been reported here before , @entity2 do not wish to sack their manager and it is still highly possible they may not			0
however , footballers ’ body language can undo a manager almost as quickly as results and , from that point of view , the signs were bad for @entity35 at @entity3			1
for all @entity1 ’s improvement , they are not a side that should be putting four past the champions but this was a @entity2 team seemingly unwilling to run , chase and do the ugly stuff on sunday and the club ’s hierarchy have noticed			1
it remains fashionable to blame players such as @entity235 for @entity2 ’s failings and it seems inevitable the @entity289 will leave this summer			0
however , when players like @entity292 , @entity293 and @entity294 start to disappear from the battle then you know you have a problem			0
there was a time when @entity35 ’s level approach to life was viewed as one of his assets but at the moment there are those at @entity2 who are beginning to wonder when the @entity306 is going impose himself on a dressing room that has sleep walked its way towards calamity in recent weeks			0
@entity35 could be worried about his position at @entity2 after losing against their fierce rivals @entity314 , @entity235 and @entity294 look dejected as they await kick - off after a @entity1 goal @entity317 applauds the travelling fans off at @entity3 as he and goalkeeper @entity319 leave the pitch what does the summer hold for both clubs ? @entity1 will spend heavily on key positions such as central defence and centre forward and also buy a right back			1
the future , meanwhile , does not look bright for players such as @entity125 and @entity329			0
city will also be back in the market , with executives confident that increased revenue from commercial activity and sponsorship will allow them to operate within the constraints of @entity337 and still spend on players such as @entity339 from @entity340			0
@entity118 ’s insistence on a reduced pre-season tour will see travelling kept within reason and it would appear the @entity144 coach has won a key battle with the club there			0
@entity35 , meanwhile , may wish he had put his own foot down in that area			0
city will visit @entity350 , @entity351 and one other venue on a post-season trip – though there will be no actual game in @entity351 – while a pre-season venture to @entity357 and @entity358 looks set to total somewhere in the region of 21 days			0
in this area , the two men are different			0
@entity118 – not without his own flaws – has developed in to a manager of his football club in a way , for example , that @entity367 never did			0
@entity35 , for his part , remains a head coach			0
@entity125 came on as a second - half substitute for @entity162 at @entity3 against @entity2 @entity118 shakes hands with his opposite number @entity35 after the final whistle at @entity3			1

@entity1 beat their rivals @entity2 4 - 2 at @entity3 on sunday
it led to supporters claiming @entity11 had been turned red once more
@entity1 had lost their four previous derbies against their great rivals @entity2
@entity106 appears to have turned @entity1 's *fortunes* round this year
