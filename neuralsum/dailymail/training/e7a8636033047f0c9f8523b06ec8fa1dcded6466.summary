by @entity0 @entity1 , the home of white beaches , oranges and @entity4 , is actually the most stressed - out state in the @entity5 , according to a new study			2
@entity14 compiled the rankings based on a number of lifestyle stressors , and rated @entity1 and its neighboring @entity18 , which came in second , highest on the stress - out meter , both for having high unemployment rates and high numbers of people risking it without health insurance , among other factors			1
@entity19 came in third and @entity21 came in seventh , both for being particularly overcrowded , with inhabitants facing long commutes , and ' stupid - expensive property tax ' , while oil - rich @entity26 , and agricultural hubs @entity28 and @entity29 , appear to have it easiest across the board , finds the study			1
life 's no beach : geographically speaking , it appears that states dotted around the coast experience some of the highest stress - out factors , while @entity40 regions have a much easier time of it ( pictured ) six stress - inducing factors were compiled to into a final ' @entity45 ' for each of the 48 states analyzed ; unemployment rates , hours worked , population density , percentage of income spent on housing , percentage of population with long commutes the number of people without health insurance			1
in at number four on the scale was @entity60 , another state where even its exceptionally good weather does n't make up for its stress factors			0
although @entity60 work some of the shortest hours nationwide , the unemployment rate is the fifth highest , housing costs swallow up a high percentage of people 's budget , plenty do n't have health insurance , and the commute time is up there as being the ninth worst in the @entity70 taking the top spot on that factor			1
@entity73 was ranked the fifth most stressful state to live in , with the second highest unemployment rate in the country , beaten only by @entity77 , and the second highest number of people without health insurance , narrowly beaten by @entity81 on that front			1
on the bright side , the population density is low , so at least @entity85 have space to stretch out as they contemplate their stressful existences			0
results : @entity1 ( left ) was ranked highest on the stress - o - meter for factors including its high unemployment rates and high numbers of people risking it without health insurance , while @entity96 enjoy plenty of space , short commutes and cheap housing ( right ) @entity101 came in at number six on the scale , with more than 61per cent of its population faced with soul - destroyingly long commutes every day , as well as expensive housing			1
@entity108 scored ninth , with a high number of people per square mile , but with housing costs below average			0
similarly , working hours are long but commutes are n't too bad , followed by @entity115 at number ten , with very similar attributes			1
bang in the @entity118 in terms of stress - out factors , are @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 , and hanging loose as some of the least stressed states after @entity26 , @entity28 and @entity29 , are @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130			2
nightmare : @entity132 ( pictured ) scored highly on the stress scale for being overcrowded , with the longest commute times in the whole country the three hardest working states in terms of long hours are @entity129 , @entity121 and @entity26 respectively ; all notably low on their overall stress - out scores , however			2
states with the shortest working hours are @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143			0
unemployment is highest of all in @entity77 , @entity73 and the aforementioned @entity1 , and lowest in @entity26 , followed by @entity29 and @entity129			0
and more people have health insurance in @entity147 , @entity128 and @entity126 than in any other states , but @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 have the lowest numbers respectively			0
all rankings were compiled using data from the most recent @entity5 @entity156 ' @entity155 , from 2008 - 2012			0
@entity1 @entity18 @entity19 @entity60 @entity73 @entity101 @entity21 @entity132 @entity108 @entity115 @entity26 @entity28 @entity29 @entity126 @entity127 @entity128 @entity129 @entity130 @entity157 @entity141			0
