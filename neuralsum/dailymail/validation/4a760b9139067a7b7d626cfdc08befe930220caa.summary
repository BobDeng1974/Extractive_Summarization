' at the inspection , the officer will check : * how hygienically the food is handled – how it is prepared , cooked , re-heated , cooled and stored * the condition of the structure of the buildings – the cleanliness , layout , lighting , ventilation and other facilities * how the business manages what it does to make sure food is safe and so that the officer can be confident standards will be maintained in the future the hygiene standards found at the time of inspection are then rated on a scale			2
