the manufacturer of @entity1 claims it is the only product in the world which can kill @entity4 without damaging the human skin or being toxic to the body in anyway a @entity8 firm which claims it makes the only chemical spray which can safely kill the ebola virus says it has been swamped with orders			1
the manufacturer of @entity1 maintains it is the only product in the world which can kill @entity4 without damaging the human skin or being toxic to the body in anyway			1
because it is non-toxic , it can apparently be used to treat large areas as it does not irritate the skin and eyes like bleach or chlorine products the company claims @entity1 does not break down human skin like other corrosive chemicals , which makes it susceptible to infection			1
instead , it 's claimed it effectively kills the virus and also stops it from spreading			2
the website claims the spray destroys the dna and rna which does n’t allow the pathogen to reproduce or replicate			1
this also significantly reduces the risk of cross contamination			1
the chemical can be used in both cleaning products and disinfectants to stop @entity4 and is already being used by @entity40 , it is claimed			0
it comes as @entity8 airports are stepping up their efforts to prevent the disease entering the @entity8 , with both @entity40 and @entity45 screening for the disease			0
@entity47 , founder of @entity48 - based @entity1 , said the company is now in discussion with officials abroad as the global fight against the disease steps up			2
he said : ' we are talking to other companies in @entity56 who want to licence the product			0
it just has to get @entity61 approval first , but that is being fast - tracked for humanitarian reasons			0
' we are also in contact with people in @entity66 are happy to send the product over for free in order to help			0
' we 're not providing a cure for @entity4 but this is life saving and preventative technology which is currently the only form of protection			0
' @entity4 is a spread through direct contact with bodily fluids or vomit from someone infected , meaning that any liquid left on a surface could potential lead to infection			0
it is so devastating that 70 per cent of cases result in death , with more than 4,500 people having already died			0
mr @entity47 added that @entity1 could be another weapon in the fight against the disease and used as an alternative to other , more harmful chemicals			1
' in these circumstances the use of bleach or high - chlorine based products can be extremely dangerous as they are corrosive , toxic and an irritant if in contact with skin			1
the company 's website states : on contact , @entity1 pierces the outer membrane of the pathogen and dismantles and destroys the dna and rna which eliminates the risk of pathogens developing resistance to the product			1
alcohol only denatures the external membrane protein which does not kill the pathogen but only temporarily disables them , allowing it to regenerate with increased strength			0
by removing the protein , @entity1 not only kills the bacteria , but any odour will also be removed			2
' this could itself create a situation in which the ebola virus can enter the human body			1
' @entity1 is completely non-toxic and non-irritant so we can use it in anything from hand sanitisers to mist sprays , which coat entire areas within buildings and prevent possible spread of the virus			1
' he added the chemical has already undergone extensive testing by the @entity132 at @entity133 in @entity134			0
but @entity135 , professor of @entity136 at the @entity137 , said : ' i am sure this product will kill @entity4 , but then so will almost all other disinfectants , including chlorine			2
' the issue is whether the use of this disinfectant has advantages over chlorine in the real world ? ' another scientist , who did not wish to be named , told @entity149 : ' a number of disinfectants have been shown to be effective disinfectants against ebola virus - these include soap and water and bleach			1
' also , none of these disinfectants can be used to treat patients , and nor can the product highlighted on the website			2
' ' the individuals who have been listed as testing @entity1 would not have tested the product directly on @entity164			1
' suffice to say i do n’t doubt that the product would work , but needless to say that the take - home message is that any disinfectant shown to work against envelope viruses will be effective			2
' @entity164 is n’t particularly hardy out in the environment - in fact sunlight is likely to rapidly kill it			0
' the chemical can be used in both cleaning products and disinfectants to stop @entity4 ( pictured ) and is already being used by @entity40 , the company says			0

as it is non-toxic , @entity1 can apparently be used to treat large areas
@entity179 says it will not damage human skin like other corrosive chemicals
claims the product destroys the dna and rna which does n’t allow the pathogen to reproduce or replicate . also reduces cross contamination risk
*experts* say product will work , but so will other disinfectants like chlorine
add that the product would not have been tested on the ebola virus
