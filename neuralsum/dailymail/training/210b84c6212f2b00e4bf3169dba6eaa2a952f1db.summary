the monarch was pictured with a huge smile on her face in the @entity10 as one of the races took place - while princess @entity14 appeared shocked and prince @entity15 had a face of concentration			0
the @entity0 also made her traditional appearance on the race track in an open landau carriage pulled by four grey horses , greeted by loud cheers from an adoring crowd of racegoers			2
but the bookies were n't smiling so much , having to pay out to punters who guessed the @entity0 would be wearing pink and those who guessed she would be wearing peach ... because they could n't decide what colour exactly her suit was			1
concentration : later in the afternoon the @entity0 was enthralled in a race as she watched from the @entity10 along with princess @entity14 and prince @entity15 the @entity0 could n't help beaming as her horse appeared to come in first , but maybe @entity14 had betted on a different steed			1
@entity35 , @entity35 is seen right finish : @entity36 riding @entity37 wins the @entity38 during day one of @entity2 at @entity2 approach : left to right , @entity40 riding @entity41 lands the @entity42 ahead of second placed @entity43 riding @entity44 during day one of @entity2 move over ! princess @entity14 appears to photobomb the @entity0 , her grandmother , at @entity2 in @entity45 so in the first punter - friendly gesture of the @entity50 meeting , they paid out in full on bets struck for both pink and peach			1
@entity54 of @entity55 said : ' we 're not going to pick fights with the @entity58 so if they say it 's peach we 'll pay on peach			0
but it was pink to our eyes so we 'll pay out on pink too ! ' the @entity5 was her usual stylish self in a pretty cream ensemble , while her nieces , @entity68 and @entity14 , both of whom plumped for hats by milliner @entity72 , rode with their father @entity15 in a carriage behind			1
during her grand entrance a military band played the @entity79 - penned @entity78 theme @entity80 - a reference to the @entity83 's ' skydive ' into the @entity84 last year			0
princess @entity85 was spotted in the third carriage , along with lady @entity88 and lord @entity89 in the fourth and final carriage			0
elegant : the @entity0 was resplendent in pale fondant pink as she was driven down the racecourse in an open landau , accompanied by the @entity5 pretty : despite being without the @entity6 , the @entity0 seemed happy to be at the races and has a horse , a filly named estimate , in the @entity99 on thursday stylish : princesses @entity68 and @entity14 made an appearance in hats designed by @entity72 and were accompanied their father , the @entity15 the royal party was joined by @entity104 , @entity105 - the wife of the late princess @entity107 's son @entity15 - who looked striking in a vibrant imperial purple coat dress			1
@entity35 , the @entity35 , wearing a fashion - forward blue ensemble , and her husband @entity110 , watched the procession from the royal box			0
although the royal party is never less than elegant , in recent years , @entity2 has become a less - than - stylish affair with fake tan , bizarre hats and micro minis becoming the norm			2
but two years after imposing strict sartorial rules , it seems that @entity2 has become a contender in the style stakes once more			1
leading the charge was @entity125 soprano @entity124 who looked stunning in a sunny bright orange dress and matching orange and hot pink fascinator by milliner , @entity129			2
family affair : the queen was joined by the @entity4 and the @entity5 , as well as the @entity15 and his daughters , @entity68 and @entity14 vibrant : the @entity0 's niece by marriage , @entity134 , looked wonderful in purple , while @entity68 and @entity14 were pretty in black and grey enjoying the day : the @entity138 and @entity35 , radiant in petrol blue , watched the parade accompanied by friends from the warmth of the @entity10 @entity144 mania : along with @entity146 star @entity145 , both @entity149 and @entity148 singer @entity147 plumped for low key black and white combos stunning : @entity125 soprano @entity124 looked wonderful in orange silk and was joined by @entity146 favourite , @entity145 , on day one of @entity2 lovely : @entity154 's wife @entity153 was a picture in pale pink lace , while @entity158 's girlfriend @entity157 opted for one of her trademark print dresses colourful : guests arriving at day one of this year 's @entity2 appeared to have taken organisers ' stern sartorial advice firmly to heart striking : londoner @entity166 and pretty @entity167 ( right ) wowed fellow racegoers with their stunning floral head wear her daring choice was echoed by many of her fellow race goers , most of whom plumped for bright hues - perhaps to make up for the miserable squalls of rain that sent many scurrying for shelter			1
' i love @entity2 , it 's just so fashioned , old - fashioned glamour , old - fashioned traditions , ' said the singer , who added : ' i would wear a hat every day if i could			2
' @entity124 was joined by @entity184 and his @entity186 wife , @entity185 , who looked beautiful in a low key cream dress and @entity148 singer , @entity147 , who picked a slick black dress teamed with a showstopping gold necklace			0
also on hand to get @entity2 off to a flying start was @entity146 megastar , @entity145 , who chose a subtle monochrome ensemble , topped with a pretty black and white floral hat			1
betting on her majesty : @entity197 are offering punters the chance to have a flutter on the @entity0 's sartorial choices , although it seems most think blue @entity154 's wife , @entity153 , looked particularly beautiful in a stunning pale pink 1930s style frock teamed with a white picture hat , while @entity158 's other half , @entity157 , plumped for trademark prints teamed with a pair of delicate lemon shoes			1
in the paddock , a flock of beautifully dressed women in a array of stunning rainbow hues were drawing admiring glances from male race goers , although the odd shivering girl in a too - short skirt could also be seen			0
hats were big and bold , with floral motifs spotted adorning headwear up and down the course			2
@entity222 wore an artificial pink fuchsia plant on her head complete with dozens of blooms and a matching shocking pink dress			1
she said : ' you have to be a trooper to wear this , it 's quite heavy - but i 've been coming here for 25 years			0
' fellow guest , @entity167 chose an enormous pink rose made by milliner @entity234			0
she said : ' it 's made from layers of silk and is fabulous			0
i 've been coming to @entity2 for 31 years			0
i like the fashion , the @entity239 's and the quintessential englishness of it			0

also looking good was @entity257 , wife of veteran @entity278 presenter , @entity253 , who looked radiant in a pretty lilac dress and cream picture hat			0
nearby , @entity2 's phalanx of dress code enforcers - tasked with ensuring straps are at least 2.5 inches wide and skirts are modest - watched beadily , while surveying passing guests			1
and not everyone made the cut			0
one unfortunate racegoer - a gentleman sporting a large floral headpiece - fell foul of the @entity2 fashion police and was sent home to change			1
although today 's races will not feature a thoroughbred from the @entity0 's own stables , her filly , @entity295 , is one of the favourites for thursday 's @entity99 - a race the @entity0 would dearly love to win			2
in the foreword to the official programme , the @entity0 wrote : ' i was fortunate enough too own a winner at last year 's royal meeting , so i know what a thrill it is to have success at this wonderful racecourse whether you are a trainer , jockey , or one of the many hard - working stable staff associated with every runner			2
' also in the running for the @entity99 is last year 's winner , @entity318 , and 2010 champion , @entity320			0
