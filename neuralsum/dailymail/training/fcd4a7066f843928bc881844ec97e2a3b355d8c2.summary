by @entity1 reporter published : 17:44 est , 3 december 2013 @entity3 : 07:44 est , 4 december 2013 the engineer whose speeding commuter train ran off the rails along a curve , killing four people , experienced a hypnosis - like ‘ daze ’ and nodded at the controls just before the wreck , and by the time he caught himself it was too late ,			1
attorney @entity14 accompanied engineer @entity15 to his interview with @entity18 investigators and described the account @entity15 gave			1
@entity14 said the engineer experienced a nod or ‘ a daze , ’ almost like road fatigue or the phenomenon sometimes called highway hypnosis			0
he could n't say how long it lasted			0
under scrutiny : @entity15 initially told investigators that the brakes did n't work but then he later said that he may have ' dozed off ' behind the wheel on the sunday morning shift what @entity15 remembers is ‘ operating the train , coming to a section where the track was still clear - then , all of a sudden , feeling something was wrong and hitting the brakes , ’ @entity14 said			1
‘ ... he felt something was not right , and he hit the brakes			0
’ he called @entity15 ‘ a guy with a stellar record who , i believe , did nothing wrong			2
’ ‘ you 've got a good guy and an accident , ’ he said			0
‘ ... a terrible accident is what it is			0
’ @entity15 ‘ basically nodded , ’ said @entity48 , leader of the rail employees union , relating what he said the engineer told him			1
‘ he had the equivalent of what we all have when we drive a car , ’ @entity48 said			0
‘ that is , you sometimes have a momentary nod or whatever that might be			0
’ getting answers : federal investigators have determined that there was nothing technically wrong with the train 's brakes before the sunday morning crash but came short of fully blaming the conductor nodded : an attorney who accompanied @entity15 to his meeting with the @entity18 said the engineer has now revealed he nodded off just prior to the crash and awoke when it was too late to brake investigators have determined earlier that the deadly train derailment was not caused by any technical problems with the train itself as the driver had originally claimed			1
the @entity18 said in a tuesday press conference that it had n't found any evidence of brake or signal trouble during the train 's nine previous stops along @entity86 's @entity85 on sunday morning			1
@entity18 member @entity87 said tuesday there were ' no anomalies ' with the train but it was too soon to formally say whether the excessive speed was the result of human error - say , a sleepy or distracted operator - or a mechanical problem			1
while investigators had yet to finish talking with engineer @entity15 , questions swirled around him because the train went into the curve at nearly three times the speed limit			1
sources from the train crash investigation revealed that engineer @entity15 ( pictured ) admitted that he ' dozed off ' seconds before the @entity105 train entered a 30mph curve at 82mph in @entity86 dozens of people were injured and four people were killed			1
as @entity18 worked to determine what caused the sunday morning wreck in the @entity113 , governor @entity110 said @entity15 should be disciplined for ' unjustifiable ' speed			1
investigators began talking to the engineer monday but did n't complete the interview			2
the @entity118 is conducting its own investigation , with help from the @entity113 district attorney 's office , in the event the derailment becomes a criminal case			2
whatever the findings on the cause of the crash , @entity110 said tuesday the engineer could be faulted for the train 's speed alone			2
recovery : federal investigators would n't comment on @entity15 's level of alertness around the time of the sunday morning wreck , which killed 4			1
shown are recovery operations in the @entity113 on monday ' certainly , we want to make sure that that operator is disciplined in an appropriate way			0
there 's such a gross deviation from the norm , ' the governor said			0
an attorney for @entity15 did n't immediately return calls tuesday , but his union spoke up in his defense			2
' this is a man who is totally distraught by the loss of life , and he 's having a tough time dealing with that , ' said @entity48 , his union leader			0
' once the @entity18 is done with their investigation and @entity159 is finished with his interview , it will be quite evident that there was no criminal intent with the operation of his train , ' @entity48 said			2
@entity15 had an unblemished record prior to the accident but told investigators after the crash that he had ' zoned out '			1
the engineer , 46 and married with no children , has worked for the railroad for about 20 years and has been an engineer for 11 , @entity48 said			0
critical : governor @entity110 , seen at the crash site on sunday alongside @entity18 's @entity87 , has now said that the engineer will undoubtedly be punished for the ' unjustifiable ' speed as he was going 82mph in a 30mph zone @entity15 lives in a well - kept house on a modest rural road in @entity182 , @entity183 , about 40 miles south of @entity184			1
he started as a custodian at @entity186 , then monitored the building 's fire alarms and other systems , and ultimately became an engineer			0

' he was a stellar employee			0
unbelievable , ' said his former supervisor , @entity203 , who retired from the railroad about a year ago			0
@entity205 said he was stunned when he heard about the crash , shortly after opening his mail to find a @entity209 card from @entity15 and his wife			2
' i said , " well , i ca n't imagine @entity159 making a mistake , " ' @entity205 said			0
' not intentionally , by any stretch of the imagination			0
' a @entity105 passenger train lays on its side after derailing on sunday in the @entity113 borough of @entity86 leaving four people dead			1
