by @entity0 a mother - of - four is planning a public protest after she was banned from breastfeeding her baby at a swimming pool			1
@entity5 , 29 , from @entity6 , @entity7 , was told by a lifeguard at @entity9 that she could not breastfeed her five - month - old daughter @entity10 because it was ' classed as eating and drinking '			1
ms @entity5 - who has been taking her children to the @entity6 pool for nine years - said she then had to take her other children out of the pool so she could go to the changing rooms and breastfeed			1
she said : ' i do not know why , but i asked the lifeguard if i could feed @entity10			2
i said i would cover it up with a towel			0
when he said no , i was in shock			0
' i could not believe what i was hearing			0
i was in too much shock to get angry - i just got really upset and started welling up			0
' it 's 2014 and yet people still have an issue with breastfeeding in a public place			2
' ms @entity5 was with her son @entity43 , four , who was sat on the pool steps , her nine - year - old daughter @entity39 and one of @entity39 's friends when the incident took place			1
she told @entity46 that she had to get the children out of the pool and take them to the changing room so she could continue to feed @entity10			1
a spokesman for the pool said it was fully supportive of brastfeeding but that it was ' inappropriate ' to do so where any food and drink is prohibited ms @entity5 was sat on a bench at the side of the pool as her children swam when she asked the lifeguard if she could discreetly feed her baby she told the website : ' i felt humiliated			1
it has knocked my confidence and i do n’t feel comfortable breastfeeding in other public areas now			2
' writing a complaint on the pool 's @entity68 site , ms @entity5 said she was so shocked that she cried			2
she received dozens of messages of support from other mothers			0
she said she now plans to return to the pool so she could hold a protest over the issue			2
she said : ' it is mainly other mothers on different websites that are encouraging me to stage the protest			0
it is obviously an issue which is very important to a lot of people			0
' places for @entity87 , which runs the pool , said it was ' fully supportive ' of breastfeeding within the facilities , but said the lifeguard had wanted to ensure the safety of her son @entity43			1

pictured right : ms @entity5 with @entity10 , five months the spokesman added that breastfeeding is ' inappropriate ' in the pool , in a spa or areas where any food and drink is prohibited			1
after the furore , general manager @entity110 wrote on the pool 's @entity68 wall : ' @entity114 and all of my team are fully supportive of breastfeeding within our facility , including poolside ( not in the pool ) , and as we attract a such a large number of families from the local area breastfeeding is a common and regular occurrence			1
' we have been in contact with @entity5 and after explaining our reasons behind suggesting she breastfed out of the pool hall were purely down to our concerns for the health and safety of her other young child who required adult supervision in the pool , @entity5 accepted that our actions were a sensible and practical solution for ensuring the baby could be fed , both mother and baby would be comfortable and the slightly older child remained safe under mum ’s supervision			2
' the @entity139 made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place such as a cafe , shop or public transport it states that a business can not discriminate against mothers who are breastfeeding a child of any age			0
in @entity154 guidelines , companies are advised to make sure women they are providing a service to ' are allowed to breast feed on your premises if they want to '			0
it also advises that staff are trained to understand the rights of breast feeding mothers			0
under the @entity139 , discriminating against someone because they are with a breastfeeding mother is also prohibited .			0
