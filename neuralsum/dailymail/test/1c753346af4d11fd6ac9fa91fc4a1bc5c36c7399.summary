while pounding on the treadmill day in and day out may work for some people , for others it is a torturous task that makes exercise nearly impossible to enjoy , let alone commit to			2
founded by former @entity7 graduate @entity6 , 30 , the aerobics classes with a twist are all about ' making fitness fabulous '			1
described as ' freestyle aerobic workout , ' @entity5 is inspired by the era of old - school vhs workouts made famous by @entity14 , and involves choreography to match the @entity17 soundtrack			1
' there 's a fusion of jogging , jumping , athletic movement and dance - and a lot of huffing and puffing ' says @entity6			1
' basically there 's a warm up , warm down , both high and medium impact movement that targets all areas of the body			2
' there will be a leg track with squats and lunges and an arm track with push ups			0
' eighties alter ego : @entity6 says class goers tend to adopt a complete alter ego as their costume collection grows iconic : @entity62 's aerobic anthem @entity63 inspired many a skimpy lycra ensemble ' being freestyle though , i like to change up the tracks and let people request songs , but also give people the structure of the same key moves each week			1
' it also promises to have you ' sweating litres , laughing loads and getting buns of steel and a core to die for			0
' and according to @entity6 , there 's nothing else like it on the market			1
' what makes it different is it 's theatrical - people can come into a space that ’s all about the 1980s and escape 2015 for an hour , ' says @entity6			1
' not to mention being physically and creatively expressive while getting exercise they need			0
' and it 's not just for those stuck in a @entity17 time warp either			1
@entity92 adds ' pineapple squat challenge ' a modern take on a kettlebell workout ' the demographic is quite wide			0
we have girls in their early twenties that come , ladies in their thirties , ladies in their forties who used to listen to @entity17 music during high school , women in early sixties who are relieved freestyle movement is back and who used to do it five times a week in the @entity17			2
' ' oh and we definitely have men come along too , they love it			0
' overall @entity6 says people just like to come along because they love @entity17 music , want to put an amazing costume on , feel fabulous - and release endorphins - ' it ’s one big healthy party ! ' when asked where she got her inspiration , surprisingly it was n't from watching her mum do @entity14 workouts			1
diva demographic : @entity6 say there 's no set demographic - attendees include men and women aged from their twenties to sixties ' no strangely			1
my mum was actually an amazing tap dancer so while all my friends were in aerobics classes i watched my mum do tap exams , ' says @entity6			1
' she is though an amazing choreographer so that ’s where i get my inspiration from			0
' as for attire ? ' i would n’t turn away anyone who is n’t in a leotard , ' laughs @entity6			2
' but as people come back , gradually each week they will start to build collection			0
a leotard from @entity152 , leg warmers from @entity149 and after a while they build this whole alter ego and when then they will come in wearing a g - string leotard and no one will even blink			0
' on her own wardrobe , @entity6 takes her job very seriously , admitting she 's never worn the same outfit twice , ' an i 've been teaching for three years - so yes my lycra costumes take up a whole room now ' - ( 65 leotards to be precise )			1
fit and fun : @entity6 says unlike treadmill workouts , @entity5 is about having fun and forgetting it 's fitness ' i like to set the standards through my face , hair and body so people feel invited to be themselves , ' she says			1
aside from the costumes , music and theatrics , @entity6 also throws in some novelty competitions and spin off @entity176 and @entity177 classes to mix it up for regular aerobic goers			1
' in summer , we do the pineapple squat challenge - so someone in the room will hold a pineapple in the squat track ( which weighs about 2kgs ) and it works just like a kettlebell , except your using the resistance of pineapple			0
@entity191 : @entity6 credits @entity14 as one of her main sources of inspiration behind @entity5 ' when we do @entity176 class i will mix it up with a disco ball ! ' @entity6 says the @entity176 and @entity177 nights she likes to throw in for good measure and to mix up the moves , as well as give herself a break from @entity17 decade for a bit			1
' nineties goes off , we dance to fresh prince and that classic song ‘ sing hallelujah ! ’ so with all this fun and flair , how does the fitness measure up ? ' for me , other than getting people to smile , escape life for an hour and enjoy themselves , the best feedback i get is about fitness			0
people will say , i lost four kilos and i did n't even notice ! ' says @entity6			2
' my class is all about the simplicity of moves ' : @entity6 says those with two left feet wo n't have any difficulty ' a lot of exercise these days is scientific , counting reps and scooping protein powder			1
i respect that but that ’s not me			0
my exercise has always been jumping on my bed and having fun , and i know there is a big group out there that has brains that work the same as mine , ' says @entity6			1
' people want variation , they want a ballad and they want to go nuts when the chorus hits			0
and the great thing about using songs is they 're only 3.5 - 4 minutes long so there ’s comfort in the fact you ’re jumping up and down but there 's ‘ just one more chorus ’ and then we ’ll be done			0
' so for @entity6 it all just boils down to getting people excited and wanting to have a ' bodacious body			2
' ' i love seeing people improve their quality of life through the magic of music and star jumps - as sentimental as that sounds			0
' as for those with two left feet , @entity6 says you wo n't have any trouble			2
baby one more time : every now and again a @entity176 or @entity177 class is thrown into the mix , which @entity6 says ' go off ' ' my class is all about the simplicity of moves			2
i think it 's much more enjoyable to do simple moves well and enjoy it than struggle with something complicated and not enjoy it			0
so whether you 've never danced or are a dancer who wants to keep their skills up , @entity5 is all about simplicity and completely inclusive			2
' and it seems this ' blast from the past ' class is only growing			0
@entity6 now runs additional side business ' dial - a - sweat ' where she takes hens parties for a class , and has travelled all around @entity284 from @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity287 overlooking the harbour bridge			1
and with two current locations in @entity290 and @entity291 that run weekly ( and @entity292 for a while ) , @entity6 believes the demand is strong and she already has her eyes on even bigger things			1
' i want the whole world @entity297 , that ’s the plan			0
' ' and if i have too much make - up on and have sweat running on my face then that ’s all part of it			0

' @entity5 ' aerobics classes allow attendees to ' forget 2015 for an hour '
classes dress up in skimpy leotards and work up a sweat to @entity17 hits
classes currently run in @entity284 's @entity290 and @entity291
founder @entity6 also offers ' @entity317 ' class for hens parties
