@entity6 performed a back flip hundreds of feet in the air after climbing to the top of the @entity9 in @entity10 but the stunt does n't quite go to plan , not because he lands badly , but because after making his descent from the bridge , he falls right into the arms of local police who arrest him			1
the footage starts with the pair climbing the 380 feet to the top of the @entity9 , not seeming to use any sort of safety equipment			2
mr @entity6 is then seen scaling the metal beams to reach the top platform , where he and his friend dangle over the edge - where one slip could cause the other to fall to certain death			0
