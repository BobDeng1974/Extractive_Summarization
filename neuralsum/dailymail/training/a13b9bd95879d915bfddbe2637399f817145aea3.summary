school absenteeism has plummeted to a record low following a crackdown on term - time family holidays			2
new official figures show that in total , @entity7 ’s primary and secondary pupils missed 35.7 million days of school in the autumn and spring terms of 2013/14 - down around 4.2 million from the same two terms the year before			1
the overall authorised absence rate - time off approved by schools - alone has dropped from 4.3per cent to 3.5per cent , with statisticians suggesting that this is due to a decrease in illness and agreed family holidays			2
full classroom : figures show that @entity7 ’s primary and secondary pupils missed 35.7 million days of school in the autumn and spring terms of 2013/14 - down around 4.2 million from the same two terms the year before in total , 2.5 million school days were lost because of family holidays , both those authorised by the school and unauthorised , down 0.8 million from 3.3 million the year before			1
government officials suggested that this drop was down to former education secretary @entity32 's tough new rules on holidays which mean that headteachers can now only grant permission for trips during term time in ' exceptional circumstances '			1
previously , school leaders could grant up to 10 days leave a year for family holidays in special circumstances			2
rules : school reform minister @entity42 ( left ) suggested the drop was down to @entity32 's ( right ) new rules which mean headteachers can only grant permission for term time trips in ' exceptional circumstances ' the change , which was brought in last september , has proved controversial , with opponents arguing that some families are unable to , or can not afford to take breaks during school holidays			1
and the figures note a ' small increase ' in family holidays that have not been approved by the school , suggesting that some parents are deciding to take family trips despite not gaining the school ’s approval			2
the latest data also shows a fall in time missed due to illness , the most common reason for absence , with 2.7per cent of half days lost for this reason in the autumn and spring terms , down from 3.3per cent the year before			1
school reform minister @entity42 said : ' our plan for education is getting more young people than ever before back in class , helping thousands more to fulfil their potential and realise their aspirations			0
' missing lessons can be hugely damaging to a pupil ’s education - but today ’s figures show more pupils than ever before are getting the best preparation for life in modern @entity83			2
' the truancy , or unauthorised absence rate has also fallen slightly to 0.9per cent from 1per cent , the statistics reveal			0
and fewer youngsters are being classed as ' persistently absent '			0
around 262,255 pupils missed 15per cent of lessons in the autumn and spring terms of 2013/14 - down from 439,105 who were in this category five years ago			1
a pupil who misses at least 15per cent of school time throughout their school career loses out on around 18 months of lesson time , the @entity94 said , damaging their chances of fulfilling their potential			0
parents are legally responsible for ensuring children aged five to 16 attend school regularly , unless they are home educated			0
headteachers , social workers or police can issue parents with penalty notices of up to £ 120 if a child regularly misses school , and their parents have not taken action or asked for help			0
if this is not paid a prosecution will follow , which can lead to a fine of up to £ 2,500 , a community sentence , or even a three - month jail term			0
changes : former education secretary @entity32 's reforms on school holidays in term time were brought in last september , and truancy fines have also risen council officials say that , aside from their education suffering , children who are often absent find it harder to sustain friendships , and are more likely to get involved with crime			1
the government has insisted that its reforms to deal with school absence are starting to have an effect			0
under the changes , truancy fines have risen from £ 50 to £ 60 , and from £ 100 to £ 120 if they are not paid within 28 days			0
guidance on school holidays has also changed , with headteachers now only granting permission for term time trips in ' exceptional circumstances ' .			1
