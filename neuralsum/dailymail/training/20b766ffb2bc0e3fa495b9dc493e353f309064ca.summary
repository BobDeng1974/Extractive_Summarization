@entity0 , eight , from @entity1 , is tired			1
he 's also in tears thanks to the weight of the heavy plank he 's been asked to carry but @entity6 has no sympathy			2
' you feel that pain son ? ' he thunders			0
' that 's what your mother feels when you decide to disrespect her ! ' like thousands of other @entity14 children , @entity0 has been enrolled in what has been dubbed an ' extreme brat camp ' because of his poor behaviour			1
at @entity28 's ' @entity24 ' , children aged between five and 14 are put through a series of military drills , often running late into the night , followed by lengthy hikes conducted to a marching beat of ' dis - cip - line , res - pect '			1
@entity40 though it might sound , @entity28 's camps , the majority of which involve children from @entity1 ' poorest and most dangerous neighbourhoods , do get results			1
and with endorsements from the @entity48 , local councillors and @entity50 's @entity51 ringing in his ears , @entity28 is proud of what his boot camps achieve			1
' when we first started the programme , we dealt with 14 to 18 year old kids , ' he explains			2
' but then we realised that 16 and 17 year old kids ... they 've already dropped out of school and got gang tattoos			2
' they 're doing drugs and turning around more money in a month than i do in a year			2
it was then that i realised that i needed to start them at an earlier age and we dropped our age from five to 14			0
you 've got to catch these kids young			2
' discipline : according to @entity28 , many of his young charges are at risk of joining one of @entity1 's notorious gangs no messing around : @entity28 says discipline is missing from many of his young charge 's lives the majority of his recruits come , like @entity0 , from single parent families and are frequently without a male role model - @entity0 's father is in prison			1
this , says @entity28 , is one of the key causes of bad behaviour			1
' in today 's society , when the male parent is absent , kids lean towards that gang member , who has that authority , who has that strength , who has that lifestyle			2
' it 's a lifestyle that once mirrored @entity28 's own			1
the part - time security guard and @entity100 grew up in the @entity101 , a tough part of @entity103 , before finding salvation in the military			2
now he hopes to replicate that success with the 17 new recruits that arrive at his camps each weekend , while also providing them with the male authority figure that they lack			2
' discipline , that 's something these kids are missing , ' he explains			1
' if i was the @entity118 , every kid would go through boot camp			0
tough stuff : @entity28 leads a drill during one of his weekend boot camp courses in @entity124 hard work : along with military drills and long hikes , a weekend with @entity28 involves a spot of hard labour what 's more , he adds , satisfied , ' of the 10,000 kids that have come through my life , i 'm blessed to say that many now want to be like me '			1
so popular have boot camps like the one run by @entity28 become , the ' child intervention ' industry is now worth in excess of $ 2bn a year and has spawned an offshoot in the form of companies that specialise in collecting unwilling children and carting them off to camp			1
' families hire me who have out of control teenagers to extract them and transport them to a treatment facility or boarding school that the families have chosen for their child , ' explains @entity1 - based @entity151			1
' between 500 and 1000 families contact us a month			0
our operation is nationwide across the @entity14			1
' one such destination is the institution run by @entity156 , @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity159			1
like @entity28 , he operates a regime that is high on the discipline and exercise and low on the creature comforts and sympathy			1
his programmes last for up to 30 days , with children cared for by @entity156 and his team of crack instructors , although for shorter weekend stints , the youngsters involved must be accompanied by their parents			2
tough love : @entity151 specialises in carting unwilling children off to the camp of their parents ' choice @entity40 : according to mr @entity151 , between 500 and 1000 families contact him in desperation each month a weekend at @entity157 starts with what @entity156 dubs ' shock and awe ' and involves a series of military style drills in order to tire the children out so ' i can see what their personality is really like '			1
that completed , the children are put to bed in military style tents in a field surrounded by razor wire that butts up against the local prison			2
any whisper of dissent and the boys - and @entity156 's camps do attract an overwhelmingly male client√®le - are put to work shovelling piles of dirt			1
' we laughingly call these kids @entity206 , ' he says , smiling			0
' when the enemy is in your house , it 's a scary place to be and that 's what i deal with every single day			2
' the behaviours we deal with are mostly rebellion			0
they just do n't want to be told what to do			0
my kids are good kids making bad choices , ' he continues			0
' but they will be treated like juvenile delinquents			0
that 's kind of scary but that 's what we want			2
' among them is @entity226 , 10 , from @entity159 , whose mother @entity227 has reached the end of her tether with his recalcitrant behaviour and constant swearing			1
' the main issues with @entity226 are disrespect and defiance , ' she says			0
' it got to a point where i was getting calls from his school , he was being suspended , and i did n't want it to progress			0
' we recently went on vacation and he was yelling f - words from across the pool and we were kicked out of the hotel			0
' does she think @entity156 's military methods are too much ? ' i think it 's extreme that a 10 - year - old rules my house , ' she says , firmly			1
these people are not touching my children , they have not said anything demeaning to them and they have not physically harmed them at all			2
' these are sentiments with which @entity156 wholeheartedly agrees			0
' i 'm not about punishment at all , ' he explains			0
' what i 'm about is making kids understand that in every society , if there 's no rules , there is chaos			0
and that 's just about where we are today in the world			0
the kids are running the world			0
' children might be running the world outside of @entity157 but inside , @entity156 is most definitely in charge			1
listen up ! both @entity28 and @entity156 are fond of motivational pep talks , although discipline comes top of the list plaudits : both @entity28 's and @entity156 's camps have won plaudits from local councils and law enforcement give me twenty ! @entity28 's @entity24 and @entity157 involve plenty of physical exercise during the 30 day course , children spend their days picking up spent cartridges on the local sheriff 's gun range , picking up litter on the highway and mowing the grass verges			1
privileges have to be earned , among them hot suppers , while any infractions are punished with a trip to the dirt pile or the threat of an extension of your time at @entity157			1
' just because your mum signed a contract for 30 days , it does n't mean you 're going home in 30 days , ' thunders @entity156			0
' i can pull that plug in a heartbeat and i will			0
i will tell them [ parents ] that he does n't deserve it and he has n't earned it			0
' parents also have to commit to @entity156 's boot camps and attend parenting classes both before and after @entity157			1
@entity156 says this is key to getting results and says it stops people from giving up on their delinquent children without at least attempting to help them			0
' i truly believe that the kids are worth saving , ' he adds			0
' a lot of people give up on kids way too soon			0
' for her part , @entity227 is thrilled with the changes the camp has wrought on her son @entity226			0
' oh , him and 10 of his friends , heck yeah , ' she exclaims when asked whether she would consider sending her child back to @entity157			1
' even if i have to get a dirt pile delivered to my house , i 'll do it			0

camps such as @entity157 in @entity159 specialise in tough discipline
others , among them @entity28 's @entity345 in @entity1 , tackle delinquency
children as young as five years old can be enrolled in the camps
' @entity352 brat camps ' are *hugely* popular in the @entity14 and worth $ 2bn a year
