@entity0 has launched its eagerly awaited 55ins television which , thanks to oled technology , promise startlingly clear images on screens just 4mm thick			1
the set - the first big screen oled on the market - heralds the arrival of a new technology which is set to take over our living rooms			2
the @entity14 company said the @entity15 have a price tag of 11million won ( £ 6,363 ) , and will be delivered to buyers in its home market next month			1
organic light - emitting diodes promise images with enhanced clarity , deeper colour saturation and sharper contrast they will be available in @entity30 , @entity31 and the rest of @entity33 before the end of march			1
while @entity0 becomes the world 's first company to bring a big - screen next - generation tv to market , it 's far from clear whether the bet will pay off			2
manufacturing the sets is difficult and expensive , while incremental increases in image quality offer diminishing returns to consumers and the company is beset by cut - throat competition from rivals			0
tvs using @entity50 - organic light - emitting diodes - offer images with enhanced clarity , deeper colour saturation and sharper contrast than standard liquid crystal display tvs			1
wafer thin : thanks to the oled technology , the new 55in television has a screen that is just 4mm thick the advanced , energy - efficient display technology makes it possible to manufacture thinner televisions , with @entity0 's model measuring up at just 4mm thick			1
@entity0 's announcement is the culmination of a race by electronics makers to be the first to deliver the next - generation sets			0
@entity70 showed up the world 's first 11in oled tv set in 2007 , but the @entity74 company failed to follow up with a bigger display			0
while oled panels are more widely used in mobile screens , mass producing large panels is still tough because of technological challenges			0
@entity81 , director of @entity0 's tv business , said in an interview last year that only two companies in the world have a capacity to mass produce large screen oled tvs : @entity0 and rival @entity14 company @entity89			2
even though @entity0 and @entity89 touted @entity50 as the future of television , both failed to deliver them to the market as promised in the fourth quarter of 2012 due to manufacturing challenges			0
@entity89 declined to comment on the availability of its oled tvs , saying making perfect products is more important than the launch schedule			0
grabbing the title of the first oled tv maker is much more symbolic than practical because initial production numbers will likely be small			0
manufacturing big - screen new @entity15 requires billions in investments to upgrade factories			0
@entity14 tv makers nevertheless hope their cutting - edge display technology can help offset falling prices and make their products stand out from those of their fast - growing @entity112 rivals			1
@entity74 companies , which previously dominated the global tv market , are struggling to come up with their own next - generation tv sets to avoid falling further behind but do n't have enough cash to invest in new technology .			1
