an amazing image revealing some mysterious phenomena in a gigantic galaxy - cluster collision has been revealed			1
in the region , where clusters of hundreds of galaxies are colliding , a rich variety of objects are visible only to radio telescopes			1
scientists created a ‘ true colour ’ image of the region to reveal what it would look like if humans could see radio waves , rather than just visible light			1
researchers have released an amazing image of @entity19			1
in the annotated image ( move the slider to see the markings ) , the point sources ( examples in red ) are galaxies like ours			2
blue objects are radio galaxies with streams of plasma , and in green is the ' @entity33 ' , which could be a shockwave as the clusters collide			1
researchers at the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) made the image using the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) in @entity40			1
in the image , red colouration shows longer radio waves , moving down to blue , which is composed of shorter radio waves			1
the region is known as @entity47 , and is about 800 million light - years from @entity48 and about four million light - years across			0
the image covers an area in the sky almost as large as the full moon			0
in the image , the multiple ‘ dots ’ that can be seen are ‘ normal , everyday galaxies ’ as big as the @entity56 , dr @entity57 of the @entity37 told @entity58			2
a radio galaxy is an active galaxy that is very luminous at radio wavelengths			0
it is usually composed of two jets being expelled from a large elliptical galaxy			0
radio galaxies can be detected at large distances , which makes then useful tools in studying the structure of the universe			2
‘ @entity71 formation in such galaxies is a strong source of radio waves , which come from supernova remnants and cosmic rays that are energised in the star formation regions			1
’ there is also a handful of objects known as radio galaxies , which each have a massive central black hole that emits jets of plasma			1
‘ in clusters like this the unusual shapes of the radio galaxies are due to the interaction of those jets with the cluster atmosphere , ’ dr @entity57 continued			1
‘ we do n't yet understand just why each of those sources have the shapes they have - we ’re still working on that			0
‘ but these are definitely radio galaxies in the cluster ; we think the merger happening in the cluster has something to do with the large number and unusual shapes of these radio galaxies			2
’ resarchers at the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) made the image using the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) in @entity40 , shown here			2
the @entity39 is at an altitude of 6970ft ( 2125 metres ) and consists of 27 independent antennae two of these , towards the right - hand side of the image , have long trails with them			0
this may be due to them speeding very fast through the cluster , with their plasma left behind in a tail			0
perhaps the most notable part of the image is , as dr @entity57 calls it , the ‘ big fuzzy thing ’ to the upper right			0
this is known as the @entity33 , and it is a million light - years across but its formation is a mystery			2
‘ one possibility is that this is a huge shockwave , caused when the two clusters ram together supersonically , ’ said dr @entity57			0
however , she notes that it could also be a ‘ reconnection layer ’ , where magnetic fields are pushed together until they annihilate			0
this same process is thought to drive solar flares in our sun , and also @entity48 ’s aurorae .			0

researchers in @entity40 have released an amazing *galactic* image
it shows a region of space where galaxy clusters are colliding
the ' true colour ' image shows how radio waves would look to humans
the image *includes* galaxies like ours , radio galaxies and the ' @entity33 '
some of the objects in the image remain a mystery , however
