if you have ever wondered what - or who - your partner dreams about , there ’s an app for that			1
curious people can use their smartphone to record what their partners say in their sleep , perhaps revealing details and desires they might keep to themselves during the day			1
the @entity15 app listens for noises while people slumber and starts recording the second it hears any mumbling during the night			1
the content of our dreams does n’t vary with the seasons or with the days of the week , it showed			2
but in the week or so surrounding a full moon , they are decidedly more ‘ weird and bizarre ’			0
psychologist @entity42 made the surprise discovery as he analysed the experiences of 1,000 volunteers who were played sounds as they slept			0
the findings build on @entity49 research last year which found we take longer to fall asleep , sleep for 20 minutes less and sleep less soundly at full moon			0
production of the sleep - inducing hormone melatonin is also altered			0
professor @entity42 believes that this may disturb our dreams			0
another , stranger explanation is that we evolved to be sensitive to the moon ’s rhythms			0
upon waking the next morning , users can check their smartphone and listen to what they or their partner has blurted out during the night			1
they can also share a clip of their sleepy musings on @entity65 or @entity66			0
the sensitivity of the @entity69 app , which costs 69p , can be adjusted to give people the best change of capturing any sleep talking			1
@entity73 from @entity74 , @entity75 , came up with the idea for the app and said : ‘ @entity15 monitors your sleep , but it 's not just an ongoing recording			1
‘ an advanced filtering function qualifies sounds and triggers sleep talk recorder technology in a millisecond			0
’ ‘ we think most people are curious of what is happening during their sleep and when they 're not conscious			2
so we thought that it must be a way to catch this in an easy way using your smartphone			2
‘ many users have reported their delight in finally having solid evidence that their partner snores or saying funny stuff			1
’ sleep talking recorded : upon waking the next morning , users can check their smartphone and listen to what they or their partners have blurted out during the @entity104 app organises the sound files ( pictured left ) and makes it easy for people to see how often they talk in their sleep ( right ) and if there are any patterns the @entity69 app also saves the recordings and plots them on a timeline so people can spot any patterns in their night time conversations			1
@entity116 , a shop assistant from @entity117 , @entity118 , has been living with her boyfriend for three years and says he talks during the night			2
the 29 - year - old said : ‘ my boyfriend @entity121 is always talking in his sleep and i 'm hoping to finally hear what he is saying using this new app. ‘ i must admit i am a bit worried , though			0
it would be awful if it turns out he is muttering his ex-girlfriend 's name or a girl that we both know			0
‘ if i wake up one day , look at the app and find out he has been dreaming about another girl - he could end up sleeping on the floor ! ’ dreamers beware : the app could be used by couples to find out what - or whom - each person is dreaming about , which could prove awkward if it turns out they are subconsciously thinking about an ex or something inappropriate and blurting it out in the night			1
