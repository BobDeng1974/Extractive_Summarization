in the @entity6 desert the first of @entity2 's aged fleet of @entity4 jets are landing ... for the last time			1
it 's called the ' great aeroplane graveyard ' and like thousands of decommissioned military and passenger craft before them , it 's where @entity2 's reliable but costly 767 ' workhorses ' will retire			1
in the dust of a former airforce base in @entity15 , @entity16			0
' picture hot winds and shifting desert sands , prairy dogs and rattlesnakes - and all you can hear is the hum of thousands of rusting propellers turning in the wind , ' says 60 minutes presenter @entity25 , who recently took a ticket on an empty 767 to it 's final resting place at the @entity27			1
