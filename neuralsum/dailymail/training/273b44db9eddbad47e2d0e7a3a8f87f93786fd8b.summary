@entity0 admits he is powerless to prevent @entity1 selecting @entity2 in their squad for next month 's @entity6 qualifiers as the problems over his injury mount up			1
the @entity10 manager is picking and choosing the forward 's matches carefully after he returned from the last international break with a hamstring injury			1
@entity1 's squad for @entity17 qualifiers against @entity18 and @entity19 will be named next week and @entity2 is a key part of their plans			1
everybody knows what is going on with @entity2			1
everyone knows he 's in trouble for quite a long time			2
' the moment a national team wants to select a @entity10 player , i 'm nobody			1
they can call the players , play them , do what they want			2
it 's completely out of my control			2
what i think and what i feel does n't play a part			1
' the medical departments do what they want			2
it 's not our decision			2
we can communicate , send exams and reports , but it 's their decision			2
' after the game against @entity59 , or even before that when they make the pre-selection , everything is in their hands			0
' @entity0 confirmed that @entity2 ( right ) will start for @entity10 against @entity27 on saturday @entity2 has been named on the @entity10 bench in previous games to protect his hamstrings @entity2 missed the midweek @entity70 tie against @entity71 but will return to the starting line - up for tomorrow 's clash with @entity27 in the @entity26			1
his hamstring injury is so sensitive that he may be rested or on the substitutes ' bench for the @entity78 trip with @entity79 on tuesday			1
@entity0 added : ' he plays tomorrow and starts the game without problems			1
the question is always the same : " can he finish the game and be in conditions to play in @entity85 48 hours later ? " that i do n't know			1
' but , at this moment , because i do n't think about @entity79 or the @entity78 , i think about @entity27 in the @entity26 and he plays for sure			1
he 's in good position to start			0
@entity2 ( centre ) could be named as a substitute for @entity10 's @entity78 trip to @entity79 ' if he does n't play against @entity79 , i play @entity91 or @entity92			1
but this game is tomorrow , not tuesday			0
it 's another game , another story			0
i do n't think about the @entity79 game			1
' i play tomorrow with the team i think is the best to win against @entity27			0
after that , the consequences i will face			0
i have to organise a team to play against @entity79			0
tomorrow i play with the team i think is the best to win			0
' everyone is working hard			0
he is the first to do that			0
he 's working hard in his recovery , with the medical staff and the conditioning staff , trying to be ready for every game			0
' mentally , he 's ready for every game			0
everyone is trying hard for him to be able to play every game			0
' like our @entity111 .			0
