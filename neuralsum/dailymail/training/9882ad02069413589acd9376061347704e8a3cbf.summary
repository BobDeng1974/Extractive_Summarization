@entity0 said @entity2 leader @entity1 has been ' turned into a total joke ' by his energy policy @entity2 ’s flagship energy price freeze was branded ‘ a joke ’ last night , as senior figures in the party confirmed it has been reviewed in the light of falling prices			1
the price freeze , which mr @entity1 pledged would last until 2017 , has been thrown into turmoil in recent weeks as a slump in the price of oil saw the prospect of falling energy prices			1
the @entity18 revealed yesterday that @entity2 is conducting a u-turn on the policy , which was launched by @entity1 in 2013			1
it has now been ‘ re-branded ’ as a price cap , which will allow bills to fall to reflect tumbling wholesale prices			0
yesterday @entity25 became the first @entity27 firm to offer a cut in gas prices of 3.5 per cent to its customers , and others are expected to follow suit			0
@entity2 ’s energy spokesman @entity33 yesterday insisted the freeze had always been designed to act as a cap , which would allow prices to be cut			2
she told @entity37 : ‘ if anyone is labouring under the illusion that the price freeze can be used as an excuse for not delivering price cuts then let me disabuse them of that			0
’ she explained that @entity2 would change the law to give the regulator @entity46 the power to force energy firms to cut bills when wholesale prices fall			0
however the party ’s work and pensions spokesman @entity51 confirmed the shift , saying the ‘ world has changed ’ since the freeze was announced			0
miss @entity51 acknowledged that the party ‘ did n’t use the word cap ’ when the policy was launched			0
she told the @entity66 ’s @entity65 show : ‘ clearly at the time , prices were going up … the world has changed , and now we ’ve got falling energy prices			0
’ conservative chairman @entity67 seized on the admission as evidence that the policy was in ‘ complete chaos ’			0
and @entity0 mocked the @entity2 leader , saying : ‘ he can not talk about his energy price freeze , because it has turned him into a total joke			2
’ the policy is still being promoted on the party ’s website with an image of an energy bill frozen in a block of ice , with a message stating : ‘ @entity1 ’s energy plan – gas and electricity bills will be frozen until 2017			1
’ @entity1 ( right ) was pledged that energy prices would be frozen until 2017 , and @entity2 's website still shows an energy bill encased in ice despite falling prices but critics have pointed out that the policy will backfire if families fear they will be stuck with high bills while prices fall			1
and experts think the policy proposal may have kept bills artificially high , with firms unwilling to lower prices in case @entity2 wins the election and fixes bills at the lower level			2
fund manager @entity103 last night described @entity2 ’s price freeze as ‘ good politics , but bad economics ’			1
he added : ‘ the proposed price freeze has now led to consumers paying more for their energy than they otherwise would have had to			1
