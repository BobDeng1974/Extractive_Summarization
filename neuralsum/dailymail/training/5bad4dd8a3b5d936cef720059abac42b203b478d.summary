by @entity0 it is the most famous battle in @entity3 history - its date of 1066 learned by generations of schoolchildren			0
so suggestions that the official site of the @entity9 - and an expensive visitor facility - may be in the wrong place have long been treated as little short of heresy			1
tonight , however , a team of archaeologists led by sir @entity16 will support claims first made in @entity18 that historians have indeed got it wrong			0
a new battle : in late 2013 , experts claimed that @entity22 died with an arrow in his eye not at the site of @entity26 ( which has a dedicated vistor 's centre - but on a spot that is now a roundabout on the @entity30 their research suggests @entity22 probably died not at the site of @entity26 , where @entity32 has built a £ 500,000 centre , but on a spot that is now a round - about on the @entity30			1
the evidence will feature on @entity37 ’s @entity36 following excavations of both the grounds around @entity26 , where @entity32 believes the fighting to have taken place , and another nearby site proposed by historian @entity43			1
despite expert analysis , @entity36 found no archaeological evidence that either was where the army of @entity47 triumphed over the forces of @entity22 , the @entity3 @entity22			1
@entity22 himself was reputedly killed when an arrow struck him in the eye			0
using aerial laser imaging , @entity36 then mapped the terrain - on the basis of which a group of experts agreed that the most likely location for the battle was a roundabout joining @entity60 and @entity61 in the town of @entity63			1
@entity36 said the mapping had ‘ proved ’ that the traditional battlefield - on the land directly below the @entity26 - would have been too boggy for @entity47 ’s cavalry			2
‘ military analysts studied the data to see where @entity22 , a skilled commander , would most probably have mounted his defence , ’ explained a @entity37 spokesman			0
battle : a @entity36 ' soldier ' is pictured in a re-enactment of the @entity9 , which will air tonight ‘ they identified the only ideal battlefield			1
it seems @entity22 ’s fearsome @entity79 shield wall straddled a narrow strategic pass that is on today ’s @entity30			2
’ mr @entity43 , who proposed that the battle was fought at @entity82 , about a mile north of the abbey , said last night : ‘ the one thing that is absolutely certain is that the existing site ca n’t be the right one			0
according to @entity36 the abbey site is facing in the wrong direction			2
’ @entity89 , author of @entity90 - whose own favoured site is @entity92 , two miles south of the @entity26 - asserted in @entity18 in 2011 that the traditional site was incorrect			0
misdirection : if the experts ' claims are correct , this sign is pointing people to the wrong location he said : ‘ the claim that the @entity102 fought the battle at @entity26 is not based on any physical evidence , either in archaeological finds or ancient manuscript			1
’ @entity32 disputes the @entity36 claims			0
@entity108 , a @entity26 curator , said : ‘ within living memory of the battle , the abbey was described in the @entity112 as being founded by @entity47 “ on the very spot where @entity114 granted him the conquest of @entity3 ”			0

experts claim @entity9 did not take place at the accepted location
@entity36 archaeologists found no evidence it happened at @entity26
they *decided* instead the only possible place was a strategic , narrow pass which is now the site of a major road
@entity36 : 1066 *–* the @entity130 , tonight , @entity37 , *8pm* .
