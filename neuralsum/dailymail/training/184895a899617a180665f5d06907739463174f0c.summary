by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 was ridiculed today for spending his teens campaigning for @entity4 to leave @entity5			2
the @entity7 leader delivered leaflets in the 1983 general election campaign , in which left - wing leader @entity10 vowed to withdraw the @entity4 from the @entity11			1
@entity12 joked about it being ‘ his idea of fun ’ as a @entity15 mp claimed it was ‘ strange ’ that mr @entity2 now opposes holding an in - out referendum on @entity4 ’s membership of the @entity19			1
labour leader @entity2 was mocked in the @entity21 for delivering leaflets in the 1983 election campaign as a teenager which called for @entity4 to leave the @entity11			1
pressure has mounted on mr @entity2 , with the @entity28 union warning denying people a chance to vote on @entity4 's membership of the @entity19 would be an ‘ electoral millstone ’			1
mr @entity12 has promised to claw powers back from @entity33 before staging an in - out referendum before the end of 2017			0
but @entity7 has refused to match the pledge , with senior figures privately admitting that being pro-europe is one of the party ’s few policies which business likes			0
mr @entity2 has said he would only allow a referendum if more powers are transferred from @entity44 to @entity33 during the next @entity45 – something which even @entity7 figures admit is highly unlikely			0
in the @entity21 today , @entity15 mp @entity48 recalled how as a 13 - year - old boy mr @entity2 had campaigned for mr @entity10 in the 1983 general election			1
according to a biography by @entity52 and @entity53 , mr @entity2 joined the @entity7 as a teenager and accompanied his father @entity55 in campaigning for mr @entity10 ahead of the 1983 general election			1
at prime minister 's questions today , mr @entity48 said : ‘ in the ‘ 83 general election , a 13 - year - old boy delivered leaflets around my constituency pledging that @entity10 would take @entity7 out of the @entity19			1
@entity63 and @entity2 in the @entity21 today having to listen to @entity63 every day would be a ' miserable existence ' , @entity12 claimed today			1
in an extraordinary attack on the shadow chancellor , mr @entity12 said spending time with mr @entity63 was not his idea of fun			0
the remarks came as mr @entity12 teased @entity2 for spending his teens delivering leaflets for the @entity7			1
asked by mr @entity63 what the prime minister 's idea of fun was , mr @entity12 replied : ' it is not hanging out with the shadow chancellor			2
that is not my idea of fun			0
' so i feel sorry for the @entity83 because he has to hang out with him all of the time			0
' what a miserable existence it must be to have sitting next to you the person who wrecks the @entity4 economy and have to listen to them day after day , day after day , as they say to the @entity4 people " we are the people who crashed the car , give us the keys back "			1
' ‘ do you find it strange that that same boy - now leader of the @entity7 - is n't willing either to support the re-negotiation of @entity4 's terms of membership of the @entity19 or to pledge to support to trust the people of @entity4 in a referendum on our membership of @entity5 ? ’ to raucous laughter , mr @entity12 appeared to come to the defence of the young @entity2			1
‘ i ’ve always thought it is terribly unfair to hold against people things they might have done in their youth , ’ the prime minister said			0
‘ really … if , as a 14 - year - old that was his idea of fun then obviously , you know , we have to make room for everybody			0
' he insisted that it is ' in the interests of the @entity4 people ' to have a renegotiation before a referendum			2
@entity15 mp @entity129 is to try to force an in - out referendum into law using a backbench bill			0
conservative ministers will be forced to support the law , but @entity7 has refused to support it			0
but the @entity28 union , which has given @entity7 £ 12million since mr @entity2 became leader , warned the party risks being ‘ boxed in ’ without addressing the @entity5 issue			1
unite general secretary @entity140 told the union 's national conference in @entity143 that staying silent on the @entity19 left the field open for @entity145 and others to ' exploit ' people 's concerns to win votes			1
he said @entity28 believed that the advantages of @entity19 membership outweighed the disadvantages , especially in terms of social protections and supporting manufacturing investment			0
mr @entity140 said : ' this issue has bedevilled @entity4 politics for decades			0
for much of that time it has been the @entity159 who have had to deal with divisions in their ranks over @entity5			0
' but the next general election will be different			0
both @entity145 and the @entity159 will be offering a referendum on the issue of @entity4 's membership			2
as things stand , @entity7 wo n't , because ducking this question is seen as part of @entity7 's commitment to business			2
' that is a vast hostage to fortune			0
i would not like to be @entity2 explaining why he is not joining other parties in offering the @entity4 people a vote on something that is clearly a growing source of public concern			2
' it is time that @entity7 's leadership took a new look at the referendum question			2
we do not seek a referendum to take @entity4 out of the @entity19 , we seek a referendum rethink in order to help @entity7 into power			2
' without such a pledge , our party will stand exposed , @entity145 will be strengthened in some key constituencies and the @entity159 will hypocritically charge @entity7 with being anti-democratic			2
in a tight election , this can make the difference			0
' prime minister @entity12 it is ' in the interests of the @entity4 people ' to have a renegotiation before a referendum mr @entity140 said denying a referendum would suggest that @entity7 was part of a ' political elite ' that did not trust the electorate			1
delegates at the conference approved a statement from @entity28 's executive urging @entity7 to ' urgently reconsider ' its approach to a referendum , and making it clear that the union would argue for a vote for @entity4 to stay in the @entity19			1
in the 1983 @entity7 manifesto – dubbed the longest suicide note in history – mr @entity10 pledged : ‘ @entity4 withdrawal from the @entity11 is the right policy for @entity4 - to be completed well within the lifetime of the parliament			1
‘ but we are also committed to bring about withdrawal in an amicable and orderly way , so that we do not prejudice employment or the prospect of increased political and economic co-operation with the whole of @entity5			0

@entity2 delivered leaflets for @entity10 in 1983 , the @entity21 is told
@entity7 's manifesto said @entity4 should withdraw from @entity11
@entity12 says people should not be judged by their teenage *choices*
but @entity12 insists the @entity4 people should have a say on leaving the @entity19
unite union warns @entity7 risks being ' boxed in ' by @entity159 and @entity145
@entity12 says life listening to @entity63 must be a ' miserable existence '
