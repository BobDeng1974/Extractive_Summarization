it 's been a tough autumn for @entity2 but i am delighted and much encouraged that they saved their best for last and emerged as convincing winners in what , let ’s face it , was a must - win game			1
if @entity13 ’s men continue to play to their strengths and improve , they are going to be a massively difficult team to beat at @entity16 in the @entity17			1
with that pack at full tilt , nobody is going to relish playing them and they need to show that again when they next pull on the white shirt , against @entity26 in @entity27 in their next fixture on february 6			0
what an interesting friday night that will be			0
on days when they are playing a more limited game - plan , he can be very effective indeed at outside centre			0
make no mistake , the pressure was on @entity2 on saturday and pretty much across the board everybody stepped up to the plate			1
it was n’t always pretty but wins against world - class rugby sides are n’t always things of beauty			0
it was , however , a very well thought out and crafted performance and @entity2 made sure they played to their strengths for as long as possible			2
the single biggest improvement from the @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 matches was in @entity2 ’s kicking game , which was unrecognisable from earlier this month			2
@entity74 enjoyed another fine game and kicked well while @entity76 really came to the party , launching a number of high balls and box kicks landing just outside the 22 or deliberately keeping the ball in play to maintain pressure on @entity32			1
@entity2 head coach @entity13 ( second right ) , pictured with ( from left ) coaches @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , has a formidable pack now and he can build from their with his side @entity74 kicks a penalty against @entity32 at @entity16 during the november international on saturday there was even at least one good old fashioned ‘ up and under ’			1
execute them well and they always cause problems			0
this much improved kicking was backed up by a well organised kick - chase game with @entity98 and @entity99 using their pace to hound the @entity32 and challenge for the high ball			1
if you do those basics exceptionally well you are always going to give yourself a chance			0
@entity2 must not rest on their laurels here			2
their kicking game earlier this month was very poor and they need to reproduce saturday ’s quality on a regular basis			0
they need to fully appreciate that a complete kicking game is an important attacking weapon , not a negative tactic			0
it was a pretty impressive defensive effort as well because @entity32 , who badly needed a win themselves , definitely turned up to play and there is no more dangerous back division in world rugby when they go hunting for tries			1
the official stats show that @entity2 made 158 tackles to @entity32 ’s 48 and though i do n’t remember them being under the pump to quite that extent , a stack of tackling had to be done at key times			1
@entity49 , pictured tackling @entity32 's @entity127 , put in one of his best performances for @entity2 the centre is led off the field by physio @entity132 ( left ) as being bloodied and bruised during the match we saw the true value of @entity49 in organising the defensive line behind the scrum and with the way he put his body on the line			1
the @entity143 centre had one of his finest test displays and though midfield is clearly an area where @entity2 have yet to find a settled combination he stated his case strongly			1
elsewhere , it ’s difficult to look beyond the @entity2 pack			1
they have been formidable over the past four weekends and it is worth emphasising they were unable to consider six @entity156 forwards from 2013 - @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162			1
i also consider @entity164 to be right up there in terms of quality			0
i am a great believer in not making injury excuses - go with your best available team and get judged from that			0
but what a strong position to be in come the @entity174 if four or five of those are fit again			0
this pack will only get stronger and should give @entity2 a rock solid foundations going forward			1
@entity2 's scrum was dominant and was the cornerstone of their victory over @entity32 @entity182 and @entity2 blindside @entity183 feeds @entity76 after a clean take at lineout time winners 1 ) @entity188 ( @entity189 ) has come of age this november and stormed through four tough tests with flying colours			1
strong scrummager , good around the park			0
still young but @entity196 captaincy has matured him			0
@entity188 ( centre ) impressed for @entity2 this autumn and has really improved and matured 2 ) @entity74 ( @entity189 ) along with @entity199 , the best attacking option @entity2 have at fly - half			1
has made a very accomplished start			0
needs to build on that - beginning against @entity26 in @entity27			0
@entity204 ( left ) has established himself as one of the most exciting no 10s in @entity2 right now 3 ) @entity35 ( no 8 ) missed out initially to @entity208 but has taken his chances well			2
@entity35 is a big and dangerous ball carrier who knows where the try - line is and now fit enough to make that count for 80 minutes			0
@entity35 was extremely impressive and is a very dangerous ball carrier for @entity2 losers 1 ) @entity217 ( @entity189 ) i ’m a big @entity87 fan , i love his abrasiveness and big - match goal - kicking - but he is a 12 now for @entity2			1
did n’t look match - fit going into the autumn and maybe should n’t have been picked			2
@entity217 ( right ) has been out of form and low on fitness and is now a no 12 option for @entity2 2 ) @entity226 ( @entity189 ) still one of the best two scrum - halves in @entity2 but took a backward step this month			2
must get back into the groove with @entity196 and ‘ go again ’			0
at his best , an important player for @entity2			2
@entity226 is still one of the best two scrum halves in @entity2 but he needs to find his form again 3 ) @entity208 ( no 8 ) a considerable talent but not fit and fast enough yet to make an impact at elite level			2
@entity2 ’s backrow lacks a little pace and they can not afford another slow unit			2
must work on his conditioning			0
@entity208 has lost his place in the @entity2 side and needs to improve his fitness to get it back			1

@entity2 beat @entity32 26 - 17 at @entity16 on saturday
they ended a tough autumn with an encouraging and convincing win
@entity13 has a formidable pack at his *disposal*
@entity74 and @entity76 also put in encouraging displays
@entity2 can welcome back six @entity156 into the forwards as well
by the @entity17 , @entity2 wo *n't* be a side you want to face at @entity16
