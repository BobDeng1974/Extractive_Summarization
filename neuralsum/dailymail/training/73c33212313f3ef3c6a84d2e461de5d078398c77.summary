not long after full - time on sunday and @entity0 has already posted photographs of his stellar performance against @entity4 on his @entity6 page			1
by this morning , they had been viewed and ' liked ' by almost 70,000 people			0
pretty much one for every @entity13 fan inside @entity14 on sunday , the ripples of @entity11 's efforts nevertheless spread much further than the boundaries of @entity16 , @entity17			1
this was perhaps that day when @entity11 confirmed his arrival as one of the best goalkeepers in the world			1
it has been some journey , too			0
' he is one of the best coaches i have ever seen , ' said @entity11			1
' it 's a new system			2
he knows everything about positioning and what i should do with my feet			0
' three years ago , however , the work @entity13 were trying to get in to their new arrival from @entity56 was different , certainly more basic			1
' his first six months were horrendous , ' said @entity11 's former goalkeeping coach @entity58 in an interview with the @entity60 fanzine			1
' we worked with him on and off the field to make him more powerful			0
@entity11 has described @entity13 's goalkeeping coach @entity46 ( left ) as one of the best he 's worked with @entity13 's former goalkeeper coach @entity58 revealed the club made changes to make @entity11 more powerful ' he would finish training and want to go home			1
when i told him to come back in the afternoon he 'd ask , " why ? " ' there were lifestyle issues			2
he 'd sleep two or three times a day			1
he 'd have his main meal late at night			2
we pushed protein drinks on him straight after training			0
' we physically made him drink			2
we had him in the gym a lot			0
they do n't do the gym in @entity86 as much			0
we needed to build his core strength			0
@entity11 , pictured with sir @entity88 upon signing , endured a ' horrendous ' first six months at the club the @entity92 stopper was forced to make a number of lifestyle changes after joining @entity13 in 2011 ' but he has calmness , composure and inner strength			1
' playing in front of 76,000 ? no problem			0
' @entity11 's official stats reveal that he weighs 76kilos , just short of 12 stone			1
that 's five kilos ( or ten pounds ) heavier than when he arrived for almost £ 18m in the summer of 2011			2
the improvement is testimony to time spent in the gym , time spent changing his body from one that @entity111 's @entity110 famously said needed ' to grow in to his clothes ' to the purpose - built @entity114 physique we see today			2
@entity11 is now five kilos heavier than when he first arrived in @entity17 from @entity56 for £ 18million ' i do not think people appreciate just how hard it was for me coming to a new country at that age and a different type of football , ' said @entity11 in one interview			2
' i knew i had to become bigger physically			0
you can see now i look different to when i first came here			0
i have much more muscle			0
' in training the players would deliberately hit high balls into me and barge into me so i would get used to that side of the @entity131 game			0
' i actually enjoy the physical side of it all now			0
' @entity58 was a great goalkeeping coach who always looked after me and i will remember that			0
' @entity11 's improvement at @entity13 has been steady			1
peculiarly he still has only two @entity92 caps , a fact reflective of the enduring talents of @entity140 's @entity139			1
nevertheless the arrival of @entity142 at @entity14 this summer means that the triumvirate of @entity144 , @entity11 and @entity145 is back in harness not too many years since the three friends combined to help @entity86 win the @entity148			1
' @entity0 is one of the most skilled goalkeepers i 've ever seen , ' said @entity145 after @entity11 played his 100th @entity13 game earlier this season			1
@entity13 team - mates would hit high balls into @entity11 's path and purposely barge into him to improve his game one of the few players to actually improve during the difficult @entity13 tenure of @entity159 - due largely to the work of the @entity162 's goalkeeping coach @entity161 is now attempting to improve still further under the rather forensic guidance of @entity164 coach @entity46			1
the man credited in @entity166 with the ingenious way @entity168 used his goalkeepers during the @entity170 , @entity46 has worked largely on @entity11 's positioning and distribution , sending the 23 - year - old home at night with videos not only of his own performances but also those of other @entity114 goalkeepers			1
@entity13 midfielder @entity145 congratulates his compatriot following sunday 's win over @entity4 ' i watch the images of the games and we speak about that , ' @entity11 told @entity184			1
' it 's important and i watch all the other goalkeepers at home			2
' sunday was one of the best games of my career for @entity13 and i 'm really happy with the saves , the win and for the team as well			1
' it 's difficult to say something about the crowd			0
when they sing your name like this , it is unbelievable			0
' i watched his [ @entity40 ] penalties before the game and i saved it			0
' but you have to be lucky sometimes			0
' @entity204 was man on the match - @entity206 @entity11 dives to his right to deny @entity40 - the @entity4 left back had converted his previous 14 penalties the @entity211 goalkeeper revealed he had watched @entity40 ' previous spot - kicks before the clash seemingly settled now in the @entity215 enclave of @entity216 , @entity11 no longer lives with his parents here			1
@entity58 and former @entity13 manager sir @entity88 encouraged him to be more independent , feeling it would help him grow on and off the field			2
now fully able to converse in @entity131 - something he was n't confident of doing as recently as 2013 's summer tour of @entity222 and the @entity223 - @entity11 has banished the homesickness that also blighted his early days in the @entity225			1
like all southern @entity227 players , @entity11 thinks of home and future opportunities there			2
why would n't he ? for now , though , he has other ambitions			0
@entity11 , pictured with his girlfriend @entity231 , is now seemingly settled in the @entity215 enclave of @entity216 ' when @entity232 said he was leaving @entity13 i wanted to be the man to replace him , ' he said			1
' i was given that chance and i am not going to let it go			0
' i would love if one day the fans speak of me in the same way they speak of @entity232 and @entity239			0
' that would mean all the hard work has paid off			0
' like our @entity13 facebook page			2
@entity11 admits he would one day love for @entity13 fans to speak of him in the same way they speak of @entity14 goalkeeping legends @entity232 ( left ) and @entity239 ( right )			1

@entity0 made a string of fine saves during @entity13 's 2 - 1 win over @entity4 on sunday
@entity92 stopper endured ' horrendous ' first six months at @entity14
@entity11 would sleep two or three times a day and eat late at night
@entity211 forced goalkeeper into serious lifestyle changes
performance against @entity4 marked @entity11 's arrival as one of the best goalkeepers in the world
