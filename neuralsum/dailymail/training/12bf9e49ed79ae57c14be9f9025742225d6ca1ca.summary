by @entity1 reporter published : 13:40 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 14:40 est , 23 august 2013 hospital administrators have taken a 10 - year - old patient 's parents to court to force them to allow her to get life saving chemotherapy treatment			1
@entity8 has leukemia and her parents brought her to @entity11 in @entity12 to treat the tumors on her kidney , neck and chest - a number of which were visible to the naked eye			1
her parents @entity21 and @entity22 initially said that she could be treated with the necessary chemotherapy and she underwent some rounds of the procedure but not enough to completely eradicate the cancer			1
they have since decided against it , saying that they want to use natural medicine like vitamins and herbs to solve the problem			0
fighting : @entity11 has already petitioned once to be granted guardianship of the girl but that initial request was rejected , and now they are re-applying to a different judge the @entity37 reports that the hospital already applied to take over legal guardianship of @entity8 but were rejected by one @entity12 judge who has since retired			2
hoping to help : the hospital 's attorney @entity42 , who is also a registered nurse , would be granted the right to make @entity8 's medical decisions if the appeal is granted ' the court can not deprive these parents of their right to make medical decisions for their daughter because there is not a scintilla of evidence showing the parents are unfit , ' judge @entity47 wrote in his decision before retiring earlier this month			2
he added that the girl 's parents were ' caring , attentive , protective and concerned '			0
it is unclear how long @entity8 underwent chemotherapy , but apparently long enough for the visible tumors on her neck and chest to disappear , as court records say that they went away but she did not go into remission			1
' @entity8 begged her parents to stop the treatments			0
@entity22 said she and @entity21 could not stand to watch what was happening to their daughter , ' judge @entity47 wrote			0
@entity8 apparently complained about feeling sick and she did n't want to become infertile			0
nausea , organ damage and infertility are all common side effects of chemotherapy , but in this case , doctors say that ' the question of @entity8 's treatment is life and death '			1
mrs @entity8 ' prayed for wisdom to discern @entity85 's plan for @entity8 ' and believed that the therapy was killing her			0
traditions : @entity8 ( who is not pictured ) and her family are @entity89 , and their beliefs force them to shun technology and in turn , some forms of modern medicine the hospital 's attorney @entity42 , who is also a registered nurse , is now appealing the decision and hopes to be granted limited guardianship so that she is in charge of making medical decisions for @entity8			1
' the plan presented by @entity8 ’s parents is almost certain to lead to @entity8 ’s death , ' she wrote in a letter to the court			2
' every day that goes by without treatment , @entity8 ’s chance of surviving her cancer is diminished			2
' with chemotherapy , her chances of survival increase to 85 per cent .			0

@entity8 , 10 , has leukemia and doctors say she will die unless she receives chemotherapy
her @entity89 parents initially allowed her to receive chemotherapy - and her visible tumors disappeared - but they stopped the treatment because she said she was in too much pain
doctors are now trying to have the court grant them limited guardianship so that they can *continue* to administer the chemotherapy
if she has the procedure , her chance of survival is 85 *%* and if she does n't , doctors say she will die within one year
