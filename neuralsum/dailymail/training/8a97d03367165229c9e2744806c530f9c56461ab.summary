it is a complaint heard in living rooms across the country – that there is never anything new on the television			2
and the @entity6 seems to be trying its hardest to prove it , with the schedule for @entity8 almost identical for two days in a row			1
both yesterday and today the channel had the same sequence of shows from lunchtime until late at night , including snooker , repeats of sitcom @entity16 and the quiz @entity18			1
when a series is shown day after day it is called stripping and is a well - known practice for soap operas and game shows			2
but it is far less common for documentaries , such as @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity41 ’s @entity40 , all of which @entity8 is showing on the two consecutive days			1
the run of programmes starts with the @entity45 , which discusses the political stories of the day with various guests			0
that is followed on both days by live coverage of @entity51 snooker tournament and then by quiz @entity18 , presented by @entity53			0
then @entity54 presents @entity38 , yesterday ’s programme looking at @entity57 ’s railways and today ’s examining the impact of the @entity59			0
this is followed by a trio of documentaries : @entity39 , @entity41 ’s @entity40 and what ’s the @entity64 for you ? a @entity66			0
these are followed by sitcom @entity16 and @entity69 before the channel moves to highlights of the snooker			0
@entity8 has been criticised in the past for its lack of original programming			1
on december 27 , it showed nothing but repeats between 7.30am and 7.30pm and then , between december 20 , 2014 , and january 2 , 2015 , 74 per cent of the channel ’s programmes had been seen before			0
last night a spokesman for @entity8 said : ‘ the programmes highlighted are clearly all different parts of a series			1
’ the @entity16 sitcom , starring @entity85 and @entity86 , has been shown on bbc2 two days in a row quiz show @entity18 , hosted by @entity53 , has also made the schedule two days in a row			2

the television schedule for @entity8 almost identical for two days in a row
the same sequence of programs from lunchtime until late at night
the shows are from same series , but are different episodes
@entity8 has been criticised in the past for its lack of original content
