two underground craters measuring 400km together in size have been discovered in central @entity2 , sparking the possibility of a previously unknown asteroid impact event 300 million years ago that caused many species to go extinct			1
the impact zone was found in the @entity8 in two parts , each 200km wide , indicating the meteor that created them split into two before smashing into the earth			1
even though it was found two kilometres underground , the impact zone is now the largest in the world , by over 100km			1
dr @entity15 from @entity16 indicates that the size of the asteroid means it could have impacted a mass extinction the precise age of the crater is not yet known exactly , but researchers think it may be around 300 million years			1
â€˜ we can not define this impact zone in anywhere near the degree of detail we can define the ones exposed on the surface , ' lead researcher dr @entity15 of the @entity24 told @entity32			1
researchers strongly believe the meteor could have caused the end of many life species on the planet at the time , including the dinosaurs			2
' from the size - yes , it could have impacted a mass extinction , ' dr @entity15 said			0
' even though we do not know the exact age of the meteor yet , we do know life was very primitive at that time			0
' the impact zone extends through the @entity48 's crust which is around 30km thick in @entity2			1
the two adjoining craters were thought to have been caused when a meteor split on its approach to @entity48 , forming two smaller ones each about 10km across			0
this impact zone , if confirmed , would be the largest in the world			2
the second largest is the @entity57 crater in @entity58 , spanning 300km			0
this zone survives on the surface of @entity48 and therefore is easier to find than those underground			0
the impact zone was flagged after rock affected by heat and pressure was turned into glass the impact zone was flagged after rock affected by heat and pressure , consequently being turned into glass was discovered , also known as shock metamorphism			2
the features of this metamorphism show that material was dramatically thrown out of the area in a span of more than 200km , indicating the possibility of a mass extinction			0
after using geothermal research to look at the internal heat of the earth and seismic data to see the vibrations of the earth 's surface , the team of geophysicists released high velocity shocks two kilometres underground by drilling			1
the impact zone was found in the @entity90 basin in @entity2 and spans 400 kilometres scientists have been using information from a major 2010 discovery that showed a large meteorite strike 66 million years ago wiped out the dinosaurs			1
a plume of ash was sent up into the air from the impact and sediment from this collision is found in rocks around the world today			0
however , none of this sediment has been discovered in 300 million - year - old samples indicating that this site could be older			2
further studies of the geochemistry and composition of the impact site are in progress .			0

two meteros each 10km across left a 400km impact zone in @entity2
a team of researchers found the crater two kilometres underground
researchers say the impact could have caused mass *animal* extinctions
the zone was found with high velocity shocks and drilling into the earth
the impact may have happened around 300 million years ago
