by @entity0 for years it was assumed by staff at @entity3 that the oil painting hanging in a private sitting room was of @entity6 , @entity7 's sixth wife			1
but when experts from the @entity10 went to the @entity3 - the official residence of the archbishop of @entity12 - to research a portrait of an earlier archbishop , they were able to shed new light on the matter			2
first , the portrait was in a frame that pre-dated the rotund monarch 's sixth wife , second ; her clothes were from an earlier period , and third , well , the woman also bore a startling resemblance to @entity7 's first wife , @entity25			1
the first @entity25 ... or is it ? this portrait has finally been confirmed as being of @entity25 much - married monarch : king @entity7 married @entity25 in 1509 , and @entity6 in 1543 tests soon showed that they were right , and now the gallery has hung the portrait of the devoutly @entity33 queen rather mischievously , side by side with a portrait of @entity7 , whose desperation to divorce her was the catalyst for @entity41 's schism with the @entity42			1
the ' exciting discovery ' about the picture was made when researchers from the @entity10 went to @entity3 to find out more about @entity46 , the archbishop of @entity12 who married @entity7 and his first wife , @entity25 , in 1509			1
the researchers , who were working on a project called making art in @entity50 , noticed the painting on the wall of a private sitting room , where it has hung since at least the 19th century but probably longer , under the assumption it depicted @entity6			1
@entity10 curator @entity57 said : ' it was immediately apparent that it was in a very early frame , something which was a relatively rare survival from the early 16th century			2
' it was a way of frame - making that went out of fashion			0
that was a kind of sign that it was something quite interesting			0
' they realised that the woman 's earlier costume and her facial features strongly suggested it was of @entity25 , rather than @entity6 , who was born in 1512 , three years after the first @entity25 had married @entity7			1
different clothes and head - dresses : @entity25 in another portrait , left , and @entity6 on the right the archbishop of @entity12 allowed the gallery to borrow the portrait , which is oil on panel , for further research , and experts subjected it to x-rays and infra - red light which indicated that under the paint was a green background similar to that on a portrait of @entity7 painted in 1520			1
the research also suggested that the features of the woman 's face had been altered , and that she was wearing a veil , which the first @entity25 would have done			0
the evidence proved conclusively that the portrait was of @entity25 , who became @entity7 's first wife after his older brother @entity95 , whom she married in 1501 , died			1
the @entity10 has now hung the picture next to a similar one of the king			2
ms @entity57 said : ‘ it is wonderful to have the opportunity to display this important early portrait of @entity25 at the gallery			2
' @entity7 and @entity25 were married for nearly 24 years and during that time their portraits would have been displayed together in this fashion , as king and queen of @entity41			2
’ ms @entity57 said that discovering the original @entity108 finish on a painting like this was ' an extremely rare find '			1
she said the portrait had been compared with the gallery 's portrait of the king from the same period and both were very similar			2
she said : ' whilst not suggesting the works originally formed a pair , the costume dates them to the same period and the works are of the same scale			0
' it is likely that both are examples of the type of portraits of the king and queen that would have been produced in multiple versions , some of which would have been paired in this way			0
' archbishop of @entity12 's official residence : @entity3 where the painting of @entity25 was on display @entity25 failed to produce a son who lived beyond 52 days and so was rejected in favour of @entity141 , her husband 's pregnant mistress			0
@entity6 was @entity7 's sixth and last wife , marrying him in july 1543 and outliving him after he died in 1547			1
the portrait was first spotted by @entity10 staff in 2009 but nothing was announced about who its subject really was until today , following years of research and tests to confirm it			1
the portrait is now hung next to the similar oil on panel of @entity7 in the @entity10 , where staff say the artists of both are unknown			1
@entity7 and @entity158 is on display from today			0
@entity7 's first wife was the @entity161 princess @entity25 , who had been previously been married to his older brother @entity95			1
when @entity95 died , six months after their marriage , his younger brother @entity7 married her in 1509 and @entity25 was crowned @entity166 in a joint coronation ceremony with her husband			0
shortly after their marriage @entity25 became pregnant but gave birth to a stillborn daughter in january 1510			0
a subsequent pregnancy resulted in the birth of prince @entity7 in 1511 and there were great celebrations , but he died aged 52 days			0
@entity25 then had a miscarriage , followed by another short - lived son , but in february 1516 , she gave birth to a healthy daughter , @entity179 , and the child lived			0
@entity7 still loved his wife but became frustrated by the lack of a male heir and took several mistresses , among them @entity185 , sister of @entity141			2
@entity141 refused to become @entity7 's mistress but he pursued her until she succumbed , as his desperation for a son grew			1
his worry was all the greater because he had read in @entity190 that if a man married his brother 's wife , they would remain childless			1
despite having a daughter , @entity7 still felt himself ' childless ' for not having a son			0
the @entity197 petitioned the @entity198 for his marriage to be annulled and when @entity25 - a devout @entity33 - heard of this , she was so upset that she , too , directly appealed to the @entity198 on her side			0
@entity25 's argument was that as she and @entity95 had never consummated their marriage , they were not truly husband and wife			0
the argument and machinations continued for six years and things came to a head in 1533 when @entity141 became pregnant and @entity7 decided that the only way to marry her would be to reject the power of the @entity198 in @entity41 and have @entity214 , the archbishop of @entity12 , annul the marriage			2
@entity25 had to renounce her title as @entity166 and be known as the @entity217 , which she rejected for the rest of her life			0
@entity25 and her daughter @entity179 were separated and she was forced to leave the royal court , living in dank manor houses and castles with just a handful of servants			0
she was said to suffer ill - health but never complained , and spent much of her time praying			0
@entity25 and @entity7 's daughter became queen mary i of england in 1553 and was known for her brutal persecution of @entity232 - earning her the nickname ' @entity234 ' .			1

oil on panel portrait was *thought* to be of @entity6 , @entity7 's last wife
painting hung in palace for years until gallery staff spotted the mistake
