when @entity3 legend @entity2 passed away at at the age of 83 in july 2002 , his body was quickly flown from his home of @entity6 , @entity7 to a center in @entity9 where his body was cryogenically frozen so that he could be brought back to life in the future			1
but that 's not what the player known as ' @entity15 ' wanted			1
a new book by @entity18 explains how @entity2 ' son @entity19 continually fought his father 's will to be cremated			1
together forever : a new book reveals how @entity3 legend @entity2 ' ( right ) son @entity19 ( left ) went against his will and had him cryogenically frozen			1
when @entity19 died two years later , he had the same procedure the last time @entity2 amended his will was in 1996 , and at that time he stated that he wanted to have his body cremated and scattered over his @entity26 fishing grounds along with the ashes of his dalmatian named @entity29 who died in 1999			1
accounts : the new book by @entity18 includes interviews with people closer to the elder @entity2 near his death , who insist he never wavered from his intention to be cremated while @entity19 would say his father warmed to the idea of cryogenics later in life , nurses who cared for the elder @entity2 say he never wavered from his cremation intentions			1
@entity43 treated @entity2 in november 2000 when he underwent surgery at @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity7			2
@entity43 and @entity2 shared a love for fishing the @entity26 and one day she brought in pictures from one of her trips			1
that prompted @entity2 and his aid @entity52 to start discussing one of their fishing trips to @entity57 , and @entity58 mentioned that his father had his ashes scattered there			1
' then @entity2 said he wanted to do what his friend did , and that is be cremated and have his ashes scattered in the @entity26 , ' @entity43 said			1
after @entity2 left the hospital , he was cared for by nurse @entity66 at his home in @entity68			1
she recalls one day when @entity19 came over and started chatting to her about cryogenics			2
@entity19 had been a disciple of the theoretical medicine since 1997 , and spoke giddily about the prospect of life after death			2
' then @entity19 , in his @entity80 way , said , " just think of it , 1,000 years from now , people could say their child could have a piece of @entity2			1
" ‘ they could clone my father ’s eyes , and a child could have @entity2 ’ eyesight			2
and they could bring him back to life and he could feel great , ' he said			0
sight : @entity19 spoke of the possibility of cloning his father 's eyes so that people in the future could have his vision stop talking about that b * * * s * * * ! : one nurse recalls being in a room with the father and son when the elder @entity2 woke up and told @entity19 to quit talking about cryogenics ' what makes you think @entity2 would want that ? ' ms @entity66 asked			1
at that moment , @entity2 stirred and interrupted the conversation			0
' @entity19 ! ' @entity2 said			1
' stop talking about that b * * * s * * * ! ' ms @entity66 asked what @entity2 wanted			2
' in his will he does n’t want a funeral			0
he wants to be cremated and sprinkled over where he used to fish in the @entity26 , ' @entity19 responded			1
' if that 's what his will says , then that 's what he wants , ' ms @entity107 said			0
' there are ways to get around things like that , ' @entity19 said			0
the book also details just how @entity19 circumvented his fathers will , and the process cryogenics scientists went through to preserve his body			0
@entity2 had never applied for cryogenics at @entity123 , the facility in @entity9 that carried out the procedure			1
but @entity19 had faxed a completed application six hours before his death with his father 's signature			2
and after being granted power of attorney and health proxy for his father , @entity19 had the power to make all decisions at the end of @entity2 ' life , despite his father 's differing will			1
preserved : @entity123 has been cryogenically freezing ' patients ' since 1976 , putting their bodies and heads in @entity142 - like steel tubes while his half - sister @entity144 disagreed with going against their father 's wishes for cremation , @entity19 was able to secure the support of his younger sister @entity149 for cryogenics			1
so after his death , he was packed in an ice box and quickly shipped to @entity123 , just outside @entity153 , @entity9			0
beheaded : @entity2 ' head was severed from his body in the process of being frozen @entity123 has been freezing ' patients ' since 1976			2
the two basic options for @entity123 customers were a ' whole body ' procedure which cost $ 120,000 and a $ 50,000 ' neuro ' procedure which just freezes the head			0
a third option was to freeze both the head and the body separately , and that 's the process @entity2 went through			0
in cryogenics , the brain is considered the most vital organ as it contains the memory			0
granted that medicine has progressed to the stage that people can be brought back to life , it 's assumed that the other organs can be recreated via stem cells			0
so @entity123 scientists removed @entity2 ' head and stored both his body and head in thermos bottle - like tanks called ' @entity183 '			2
his head was put in the @entity186 upside and rested on a can of tuna so that it did n't sit at the bottom of the stockpot			0
when @entity19 followed his father in death just two years later at the young age of 35 , after being diagnosed with leukemia , his body was preserved the same way			1
nurse @entity107 does n't believe @entity19 exploited his father , but that he was just too caught up in his own obsession			2
' i felt he was this little boy who wanted to make his dad happy , but never dealt in reality			0
a little boy in a man 's body			0
he was going to make people happy by cloning his dad 's eyes			0
who thinks like that ? i think he felt this was how they 'd make their money in the future			0
i do n't know if he was thinking , " hey i can take advantage of this old guy			0
" i thought it was more : " i 'm gon na do this for my dad and we 'll live forever			0
" it was very @entity80			0
' never grow up : nurse @entity107 does n't think that @entity19 was exploiting his father , rather he was too caught up in his own obsession with cryogenics			2

@entity2 , aka ' @entity15 ' , became *famous* as a left - *fielder* for the @entity3
when he died in 2002 , his son @entity19 had him cryogenically frozen in @entity9
but according to @entity2 ' will and those close to him , he always wanted to be cremated and his ashes scattered over the @entity26
@entity19 died just two years after his father and had the same procedure done
