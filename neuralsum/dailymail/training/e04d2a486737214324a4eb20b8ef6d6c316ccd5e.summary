by @entity0 @entity2 's first pizza vending machine has landed in @entity3 , and the $ 12 treats have been such a hit the owner is already thinking about rolling more machines out			1
the brains behind the $ 40,000 @entity9 is @entity10 , who owns @entity10 's pizza and pasta restaurant in @entity13			1
he was inspired when he was traveling in @entity14 and came across a similar concept			0
mr @entity10 admits he was sceptical at first , concerned that a machine would n't be able to produce a pizza that met the high standards he was used to at his restaurant			1
' i wanted to be assured that the machine could actually develop pizzas that tasted fresh and delicious , ' mr @entity10 told @entity29			1
however after nearly two years of developing the machine and months of rigorous testing he finally had a product that was up to the task			0
' once the machine was developed it took six months of testing until we were happy with the product , ' he explained			0
' we use stone ground flour , natural yeast , extra virgin olive oil and sea salt and rest the dough for 48 hours before it is then rolled out and topping is added			0
' the options for the $ 12 pizza are @entity46 and @entity47 however more flavours are on there way with an addition of a second machine being introduced order your pizza in three simple steps using the touch - screen monitor then wait three minutes for your pizza			1
the pizzas are par - baked in a stone oven before being blast chilled and stocked in the vending machines			0
they take three minutes to cook and customers can choose from either hot salami or margarita toppings			1
and if you 're concerned that the pizzas are sitting in the vending machines gathering dust , there 's no need to worry			2
the machine is restocked daily and if it sells out before the day 's end , a message is sent to mr @entity10 's restaurant who will then send someone to top it up			1
the @entity9 has been so popular in @entity20 there are plans to open another one with alternative toppings			1
but pizza lovers around @entity3 do n't need to worry that they 're missing out for much longer			2
mr @entity10 hopes to roll out more vending machines across the city			2
the pizza machine is restocked with fresh bases and toppings daily to ensure freshness			2
despite his assurances that the 3 minute pizzas are as good as those you can buy in his restaurant , he does n't see the @entity9 as a threat			0
' they 're aimed more at people wanting something to eat on the go rather than someone wanting a proper meal			0
' ' we 've been overwhelmed with the support we 've gotten			0
we 're thinking of actually having a competition so that people can tell us where they 'd like the next machine to be put , ' mr @entity10 said .			0

@entity10 has launched @entity2 's first pizza vending machine
the machine is *located* in @entity20 in @entity3
customers can choose from two toppings , hot salami or margarita
the pizzas take three minutes to bake and have already proven popular
