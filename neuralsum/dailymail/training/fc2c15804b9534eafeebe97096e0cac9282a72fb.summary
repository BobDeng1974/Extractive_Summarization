he was diagnosed two months ago with a medulloblastoma tumour , which doctors believed they had removed in full during a nine - hour operation on october 25			1
but mrs @entity1 refused to let her son receive radiotherapy following the first operation , and recent mri scans picked up a growth of 1.5cm squared – either regrowth or residual tumour			1

it is a human rights issue			0
‘ i ’m not keeping this case going , spending taxpayers ’ money , for nothing			0
death by doctor – people need to understand how big a problem it is			0
i could n’t forgive myself if i did nothing			0
’ the operation carries a risk of between 10 and 25 per cent that @entity36 will be left mute			2
but despite experts unanimously reporting that his cancer has returned and warning that he may have only two or three months to live without treatment , mrs @entity1 said she believed doctors were over-emphasising how ‘ sick ’ he is			1

it is simply not true but everyone believes it , ’ she added			0

’ she insisted that she was not fighting simply on mother ’s intuition , saying : ‘ this is not something i just think			2
this is something i know			0
’ she said her estranged husband opposed her actions because he had not done enough research on the subject			0
mrs @entity1 , who wants @entity36 to be treated with alternative medicine such as oxygen therapy , insisted ‘ death by doctor ’ was a ‘ bigger problem than terrorism ’			0
she argued that the only evidence cited in court in favour of radiotherapy was a study on a small number of infants from the 1940s , and claimed to have found studies from abroad which prove radiotherapy is often unnecessary			2
a doctor in court said he was not familiar with the research			2
mrs @entity1 dismissed her legal team minutes before court yesterday because she did not believe they had enough faith in her case			0
