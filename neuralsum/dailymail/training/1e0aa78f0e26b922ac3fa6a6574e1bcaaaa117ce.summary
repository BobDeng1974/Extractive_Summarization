' " i 'm sorry " goes a long way , ' @entity24 told @entity70 in the kitchen of her home in @entity74 , a leafy commuter town 15 miles southwest of @entity33			1
' but i am one who believes in forgiveness			0
' it was the last monday of the school year in 1986 at @entity81 in @entity51 , @entity38 — the country 's oldest public school — when mrs. @entity1 decided to take her kids out for a treat , an hour or so playing on the sand at @entity86			1

i said do n't pay any attention to them			0

' he managed to block them with his ambulance so we could get on back to school , ' said @entity24 , now a 68 - year - old grandmother			1
' it was very frightening			0
' when the class returned to school , @entity24 reported the incident			1

@entity24 said she too would like to meet @entity28 to hear an apology			1
' the kids were really frightened , ' she said			0
' i grew up on the streets of @entity33 , an @entity249 living in a largely @entity251 area , and i was called all sorts of names			2
you say it , i 've heard it			0
' i was n't afraid to go anywhere , but once they started to throw rocks at little children , i got scared			0
i was thinking how nothing had changed since i was a child , people would still call you names just because of the way you look			0
' the attack took its toll			0
' i could never take another group to the beach , ' said @entity24			2
' i felt i could never put other children at risk			0

but i did n't realize they were one and the same person , ' she said			0
' everyone should be forgiven at some point , ' she added			0

' i 'm really glad about that			0
it really shows a lot , ' she said			0
her partner of 17 years , retired construction supervisor @entity283 , 70 , added : ' i 'm ready to forgive him			0
but it is all very well for him to stand up on television and say he is sorry			0
he really should go to the people he terrorized — like @entity1 — and say sorry to them personally			2
' a personal apology means a lot , ' added @entity283 .			2

@entity24 tells @entity70 how a class outing to play in the sand turned into a *nightmare* for her mostly @entity326 - @entity325 students

@entity1 would like a face - to - face apology from the man who was once a racist street tough
