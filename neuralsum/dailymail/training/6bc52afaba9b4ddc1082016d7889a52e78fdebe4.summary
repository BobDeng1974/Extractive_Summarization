by @entity0 nestled behind a fence in the suburbs of @entity5 's @entity4 neighborhood , stands the @entity6 - the oldest house in the city			1
built in 1652 , almost 400 years ago and over a century before the @entity10 , the house now exists as a museum of life in the colonial ages			1
it very nearly did n't make it quite this far , when during the 1950s , the house fell into disrepair and was targeted by local vandals			2
a group of schoolchildren saved it however , having learned about its history from teachers , and enabled it to stand today			0
still standing : the @entity6 ( pictured ) , located in @entity5 's @entity4 suburbs , was built almost 400 years ago in 1652 , and is now the city 's oldest surviving house its story begins at a time when @entity5 was still jostling with new transplants ; @entity32 - @entity31 , enslaved and freed @entity33 and @entity35 immigrants , all of whom were mainly farmers			1
' everyone was an immigrant and somehow , everyone co-existed ' , states @entity40 , a distant descendant of the family who first owned it , on a @entity44 film about the building 's history			0
he goes on to point out that @entity5 remains a melting pot of cultures to this day			0
the house was built by an illiterate teenage farm laborer called @entity51 , who had just arrived from @entity35			1
educational : the house has been altered and restored many times over the course of its lengthy history , and now stands as a museum of what life was like in colonial times as it was : the house was built by an illiterate @entity32 farm laborer called @entity65 , who had just arrived from @entity35 to make a new life for himself and his wife @entity67 mr @entity40 and his wife @entity68 settled in the area , then known as @entity70 and now @entity4 's @entity71 , around half an hour 's drive from the center of @entity74			1
he went on to become a successful farmer and magistrate , bore 11 children and now has more than 50,000 descendants			1
his house was enlarged , altered , and has switched hands many times over the space of four centuries , but has always remained in the @entity40 family and maintained its structural foundations			2
inside : a peek inside the ancient home , which has been set up and filled with artifacts to make it look like it might have in its early days humble beginnings : @entity92 eventually became a successful farmer and magistrate and had 11 children , resulting in more than 50,000 descendants since @entity40 , who is now on the museum 's advisory board , is immensely relieved that local children managed to deter the vandalism which threatened the building during the 1950s			1
' they really saved the house ' , says mr @entity40			0
in 1965 it became the first structure to be designated a @entity104 and in 1982 , it opened to the public , complete with colonial artifacts and an interior set up that mirrors how it might have looked all those years ago			0
family values : a group of local children saved the house from vandalism in the 1950s , ultimately saving the prized historical building so that it could go on to be enjoyed by others ( pictured , an unknown previous family ) ' students learn what it was like to live in @entity70 in the 17th century ' , mr @entity40 explains			2
' you did n't have anywhere to escape and play video games			0
' if there 's one thing he would like visitors to leave the house with , it 's a sense of community , he says			0
the @entity6 is owned by the @entity129 , operated by the @entity130 , and is a member of the @entity132 .			0

built by @entity51 , an illiterate teen farmer who had 11 children and now has more than 50,000 descendents
today , the house stands as a museum of life in colonial times
