a government investigation criticized a bizarre @entity2 assignment that pulled armed agents away from guarding the president and his family flying in @entity6 and sent them to guard the home of a senior agent arguing with her neighbor instead			1
indeed , according to @entity13 's book , @entity11 detail were diverted from watching @entity6 at a time when intelligence reports had been received that a missile attack on the helicopter was being planned			0
the conduct amounted to a ' serious lapse in judgment , ' the inspector general of the @entity19 , @entity18 , said in a statement , ' these agents , who were there to protect the president and the @entity27 , were improperly diverted for an impermissible purpose			1
' agency officials have strenuously denied @entity31 's safety was ever compromised			2
in 2011 their posts were allegedly not manned however , the report says that the president was at the @entity27 on at least two days that the agents were ' a 50 - minute drive ( without traffic ) from the @entity27 and found no legal justification for using @entity2 agents for such a purpose			1
compared to that failure and other incidents , including a prostitution scandal in @entity51 , ' @entity47 ' stands as a strange side note			0
it happened three years ago but came to light this past may in a report in the @entity55			0
a @entity2 employee who worked as the assistant to then - director @entity58 was involved in a dispute with her neighbor , who was harassing her and assaulted her father			1
this ' resulted in the loss of several of her father 's teeth , ' the report says			0
local police arrested the neighbor , and the employee , @entity70 , sought out a protective order			2
but it did n't stop there			0
she told investigators that @entity76 , then the deputy director of the @entity2 , was a family friend			1
and when he heard her story , @entity76 told @entity79 , then the assistant director for investigations , that the @entity2 should do something to help her out			1
@entity79 directed one of his managers to have agents drive out to @entity70 's home in @entity86 , @entity87 to check on her			2
the report says that @entity58 , the agency director who 's since retired , was made aware of that decision , but @entity58 disputed that in a statement wednesday , saying that he 'd only learned of the checks being made on @entity92 after they 'd already stopped			2
the agents assigned to the task were from the agency 's so - called ' @entity95 , a rotating team of two special agents who are supposed to respond to suspicious people and situations in and around the @entity27 and national capital area			2
prowler teams are not part of the presidential protective division , and agency personnel interviewed for the report insisted their protective function was not compromised			0
the mission was over before long â€” five days of visits are documented , with the longest lasting eight hours			0
but the report notes that during those times , ' the prowler team would have been unable to respond to exigencies at the @entity27			0
' and on at least two of those occasions , @entity31 was in the residence			0
a government investigation uncovered an operation that had @entity2 agents tasked with guarding the @entity27 travelling an hour outside the city to help a coworker with a dispute with a neighbor , something agency deputy director @entity79 ( above ) was aware of no one 's watching : two of the times that agents from the @entity95 unit were away , president @entity31 ( above ) was in residence the agents sent out were part of the @entity95 unit , tasked with responding to suspicious people and situations in and around the @entity27 and national capital area			1
the report by the inspector general of the @entity19 is another embarrassment for the @entity2 , which is responsible for guarding the president and his family			1
@entity141 resigned as director of the agency this month after a series of scandals			1
the report said top @entity2 officials diverted agents on its plainclothes " @entity95 " team , which patrols around the @entity27 , on five days in july 2011 to monitor a fellow employee 's personal dispute with a neighbor			1
president @entity31 was in the @entity27 on two of those days			0
" these agents , who were there to protect the president and the @entity27 , were improperly diverted for an impermissible purpose			2
this constituted a serious lapse in judgment , " inspector general @entity18 said in a statement			0
the incident began when an unnamed employee in the director 's office told her supervisor that an altercation with a neighbor had led to her father being assaulted , " which resulted in the loss of several of her father 's teeth , " the seven - page report said			0
@entity76 , the now - retired @entity2 deputy director , thought the agency should help the employee			1
@entity79 , then the assistant director for investigations and now deputy director , ordered security checks on the worker 's home in rural @entity87 , a 50 - minute drive from the @entity27 without traffic			2
this is all happening just a few weeks after @entity141 stepped down as head of the agency over numerous lapses in security @entity18 's report found no legal or procedural justification for the checks and said the @entity2 should have stayed out of a dispute best handled by local police			1
the incident was reported by the @entity55 in may			0
@entity2 spokesman @entity200 said the agency had received @entity18 's report to homeland security secretary @entity203 and was reviewing it for findings			1
the inspector general 's report comes a month after a @entity208 veteran armed with a knife got inside the @entity27			0
that breach was followed by the revelation that an armed security contractor with a criminal record rode on an elevator with @entity31 last month , along with new details about a 2011 incident in which shots were fired at the @entity27			1
the agency 's reputation also was tarnished in 2012 when it was reported that members had hired prostitutes in @entity51 ahead of an @entity31 visit			0
@entity224 's rep. @entity223 , who is leading investigations of the @entity2 as chairman of an oversight subcommittee , said that @entity79 should be fired			2
