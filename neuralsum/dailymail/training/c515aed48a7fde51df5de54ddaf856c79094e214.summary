@entity0 is the world 's most spoken language , so it 's no wonder more and more people want to learn how to read , write and speak it			1
and if you want to learn the basics without paying for an expensive course there are now a host of apps that can teach you for free			1
and many , such as @entity14 - based @entity13 , turn this learning into a game to make it fun , while also improving how much the brain takes in and recalls			1
' users commit @entity0 characters and definitions to memory with the help of animations and mnemonics			1
for example , the symbol for ' cow ' resembles a cow and neck yoke ( pictured ) @entity13 , along with rivals @entity21 and @entity23 , all feature interactive tools that entertain as well as teach - a trend known as ' gamification ' - pioneered by large education apps such as @entity45			1
' we want to be a very popular game and we want people to play when they 're bored , ' @entity46 from @entity45 added			0
with @entity13 , users commit @entity0 characters and definitions to memory with the help of animations and mnemonics			1
for example , the symbol for ' cow ' resembles a cow carrying a neck yoke			0
and ' noodles ' look like a bowl of noodles being eaten with chopsticks			0
users are notified to review the characters periodically - a technique known as ' spaced repetition '			0
the firm compares the learning process to ' growing a garden of memory ' , with the premise being that when users learn words , they plant virtual seeds , which ' grow and bloom the more they review and practise			2
' @entity13 also offers a range of other language courses , as well as courses about art , history , chemistry , politics , and more			1
@entity45 does not currently offer a @entity0 course , however			2
' in a lot of @entity89 countries we now see ourselves as competitive with @entity90 ' , said @entity91 , who worked on @entity13 's @entity0 courses			1
' @entity90 is effective because it adjusts the difficulty level to just the right level for you			0
' adapting to a level where people feel clever is a great way to keep them playing			0
' that is exactly what our learning algorithm does : adjusts when you are tested so that you always have to struggle a little bit , but you are generally successful			0

' within a couple of hours of study you can read most of a @entity0 menu , ' said mr @entity91			2

@entity21 ( pictured ) instructs users on the order and direction of strokes with bright graphics and feedback that flashes when they miss. @entity13 also offers a range of other language courses , as well as courses about art , history , chemistry , politics , and more			1
the learning technique builds on those used by games , such as @entity90 ( pictured ) , in which each level gets progressively more difficult another app , called @entity23 , uses the video game tactic of ' unlocking ' levels only when you answer enough multiple choice answers correctly , bringing users back to beat their own memory			1
a lesser - considered obstacle in @entity0 learning is learning to write characters correctly , a time - consuming technique that greatly enhances a person 's ability to remember them			1
@entity21 instructs users on the order and direction of strokes with bright graphics and feedback that flashes when they miss. ' the only way to quickly learn lots of characters is to write them 20 to 30 times , ' said @entity206 - based businessman @entity205			1
' i started by doing this on paper , but @entity21 is better because it replays them for you in a better timed sequence			2
' a key question is whether these methods work any better than traditional immersion in a native - speaking environment or a traditional classroom			0
mr @entity205 , now a fluent speaker , added : ' people sometimes think they can take the easy route of using flashcards and dictionaries to learn @entity0 but that is 100 per cent not the case			2
' until these apps shame you into studying harder , they will just be helpful tools that reinforce lessons learned , ' he said			0
but , linguistics expert dr. @entity232 of the @entity233 believes such apps may facilitate memorisation - an important aspect of language learning - but can not offer the holistic approach a good teacher would deliver			0
' due to the continued growth and expansion of @entity133 's economy , more people than ever are wishing to learn @entity0 , ' dr @entity232 said			1
however , ' there are very , very few examples of the internet being used to teach someone a language from a beginner to advanced level of proficiency , ' he cautioned .			0

@entity0 is one of the many courses available on learning app @entity13
it has various levels that teach users how to recognise @entity0 symbols
other levels teach users how to *pronounce* certain @entity0 phrases
it 's one of a trend of gamification apps designed to teach languages
@entity21 , for example , teaches users how to write @entity0 symbols
@entity23 only lets users ' unlock ' levels when they score points
