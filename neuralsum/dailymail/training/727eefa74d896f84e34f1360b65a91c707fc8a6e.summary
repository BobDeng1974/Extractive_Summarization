people with homes in the infamous ‘ @entity2 ’ live in fear of the destruction that can be wreaked by devastating twisters			1
but one scientist thinks states in the centre of the @entity9 could be protected from destructive storms , by erecting three giant walls			1
the physicist said that the walls , which would measure 1,000ft ( 300m ) tall , could stop the flow of air from north to south to prevent the formation of tornadoes , but a number of scientists are sceptical about the idea			1
one physicist thinks states in centre of the @entity9 that lie in the relatively flat area of ' @entity2 ' could be protected from destructive storms by erecting three giant walls a tornado , or ' twister ' , is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cloud			1
tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes , but they are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel , whose narrow end touches @entity39 and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust			0
the most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than @entity45 ( 483 kph ) , stretch more than two miles ( 3.2km ) across and stay on the ground for dozens of miles , or more than 100km			0
tornadoes have been observed on every continent except @entity50			0
however , the vast majority of them occur in the @entity2 region of the @entity9 - they can occur nearly anywhere in @entity56			1
an @entity58 tornado , the strongest category , rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers			0
@entity65 , of @entity66 , @entity67 , told @entity68 : ‘ if we build three east - west great walls in the @entity70 ...			1
one in @entity71 , one along the border between @entity73 and @entity74 to the east , and the third one in south @entity76 and @entity77 , we will diminish the tornado threats in the @entity2 forever			2
’ to support the vast height , the walls could have to be around 150ft wide and the magnitude of the structures would be enough to weaken flows of air that are responsible for the formation of the deadly twisters , dr @entity65 will explain at the @entity86 in @entity87 next week			1
the largest of the storms in @entity2 are formed from violent clashes between warm northerly flows of air and cooler southbound air			2
huge tornadoes form in the region as it is relatively flat from the @entity96 to @entity76 with no mountains to disrupt this flow of air and weaken it			1
but giant walls could potentially solve this problem and cripple the air currents , according to dr @entity65			2
however , not all scientists agree that his idea could be effective			0
@entity65 of @entity66 , @entity67 , proposed the building of three east - west great walls in the @entity70 ( illustrated ) , which he claims will ' diminish the tornado threats in the @entity2 ( shown by the orange ring ) forever ' tornado researcher @entity109 of the @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity74 told @entity68 that dr @entity65 ’s idea simply ‘ would n’t work ’			1
he cited @entity116 , which has plenty of mountains as an example of why not , as the country has deadly tornadoes despite its east to west mountain ranges			0
dr @entity109 said : ‘ this is essentially a case of a physicist , who may be very good in his sub-discipline , talking about a subject about which he is abysmally ignorant			0
’ the project would also be incredibly expensive with walls potentially costing $ 60bn for 100 miles , according to dr @entity65 ’s estimates			2
meteorologist @entity129 of @entity130 dismissed the plans for the walls as ‘ nonsense ’			2
he said : if supercell thunderstorms with @entity58 tornadoes could laugh , they would have a hearty chuckle as they “ attacked ” the wall			0
if tornadoes can go up and down mountains ( and they can ! ) , they would go over / through the wall			0
’ the aftermath of a tornado in @entity74 last may , which killed 24 people and destroyed 1,200 homes			0
while scientists are keen to find ways of curbing nature 's destructive power , a number of experts have dismissed dr @entity65 's idea of erecting giant walls in ' @entity2 ' as ' nonsense '			1

a physicist from @entity66 , @entity67 thinks that three 1,000ft walls could throttle air flow to prevent the formation of tornadoes
structures would be built in @entity2 - an of the @entity9 stretching from the @entity96 to @entity76 that is flat and particularly prone to twisters
but experts have dismissed the idea , which could cost $ *60billion* for *100miles* of wall , as ' nonsense '
