by @entity0 published : 10:27 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 10:46 est , 15 april 2013 a three - year - old boy is able to walk for the first time thanks to scientists who made him a bespoke body suit			1
@entity6 was left with limited movement in his left side after suffering a stroke shortly after he was born			1
he suffers from poor vision and epilepsy and doctors feared he would struggle to walk or even crawl			1
@entity6 , with parents @entity13 and @entity15 , was not expected to be able to walk because he suffered a stroke as a baby @entity19 dynamic splinting is a form of support , made from a strong type of lycra , that benefits people with many neurological conditions including strokes and cerebral palsy			1
the splints are individually designed to fit all , or part of , the body			2
they can improve tone , posture and muscle control by supporting the body in a healthy position and by stimulating weak muscles			2
but he can now lead a normal life thanks to the £ 500 suit which supports his muscles			1
his mother @entity15 , 24 , said : ' when he took his first steps , i was in tears			0
we were on holiday in the @entity47 in the @entity48 , and he was tottering around the cottage			0
' he would let go of one bit of furniture and go over to the next bit			0
' ms @entity15 and her partner @entity13 , from @entity55 , realised that @entity6 was unwell when , as a baby , he stopped using his left side and taking milk properly			1
he was rushed to hospital where a brain scan showed that he had had a stroke			2
since then he has been epileptic , has had poor vision , and has suffered from muscle weakness down the left side of his body			1
however , his life turned around when staff at the @entity69 pub in @entity55 offered to help raise money for him to have a specially made @entity71			1
@entity6 's suit helps him by keeping his hips and back straight			1
it also stabilises his body and keeps his posture balanced so he can move more normally			0
ms @entity15 said : ' it 's very tight fitting and pulls his muscles in the correct directions			0
' the @entity80 now replaces it every time he grows out of it			0
the stroke left the three - year - old with weakness in his left side , epilepsy and poor vision @entity6 has now been fitted with a @entity90 which supports his muscles and improves his posture so that he can walk ms @entity15 said : ' he 's growing quickly and goes through about four suits a year			1
' when he got the suit we knew he would walk , but we did n't know when it would happen and how soon			2
it felt like we were waiting forever			0
' ' where the stroke affects one side of his body he 's very lopsided and his spine had started to bend a bit			1
' the lycra suit straightens up his spine and his hip and stimulates the muscles in his left arm as well			2
' we are absolutely thrilled that he 's walking and he ca n't wait to run now			0
' @entity108 are a relatively new way to help those who have suffered a stroke			0
@entity6 's mother @entity15 , 24 , said : ' when he took his first steps , i was in tears			2
it was amazing ' they have to be made to measure to achieve a snug fit and increase pressure on the muscles that need support			0
talking about @entity6 's condition , @entity122 , neo-natologist consultant at @entity124 in @entity55 , said : ' in my first ten years of working in @entity55 i have seen three cases of strokes in babies			1
' it occurs in one in every 2,500 to 5,000 births , not all are diagnosed early on and some would be clinically sound			0
' the key difference with infants is they have a better chance of recovery than adults			0

@entity6 , from @entity55 , had a stroke shortly after he was born
left him with epilepsy , poor vision and weakness in left side of his body
doctors *thought* he would struggle ever to walk , crawl or get around
but his £ 500 @entity71 suit supports his weakened muscles
he can now walk and is looking forward to learning to run
