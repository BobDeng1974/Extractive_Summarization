the annual @entity1 ’s wars have begun , with supermarkets under - cutting each other on the popular summer drink			1
get in there quick at @entity6 , where it ’s £ 12 for a litre bottle until the end of today , or go to @entity10 where it ’s £ 9 for a 70cl bottle ( which works out at £ 12.86 a litre )			2
at @entity15 it is £ 15 a litre and at @entity18 it is £ 18 , but you get a £ 5 jug free			2
they are all gin - based , like @entity1 ’s , with added sugar and fruity flavours , though the alcohol content varies and some taste better than others			1
i had the onerous task of blind - testing some in the sunshine at the weekend ( made up to the same proportions of alcohol , lemonade and fruit )			2
it ’s a tough job			2
@entity28 ’s from @entity29 £ 5.99 , 70cl ( £ 8.56 per litre ) you could tell the difference between this and @entity1 ’s only if you tasted them side - by - side — made up in a jug with lemonade and fruit , i am sure that no one would twig that you ’d used a cheap version			1
@entity28 ’s is slightly more citrussy and less sweet , and at 21.9 per cent alcohol against @entity1 ’s 25 per cent it is also less alcoholic			1
the bottle is quite a naughty copy — there ’s even a signature scrawled on the lid just as there is with @entity1 ’s			1
verdict : by the time you ’ve added lemonade , a sprig of mint and loads of fruit , your guests will never know			2
score : 4/5 summer in a cup : @entity1 's is usually served with a selection of fresh fruit including strawberries , cucumber , mint and orange pitchers from @entity30 ’s £ 12 , 1 litre a few years ago , @entity88 , which makes @entity1 ’s , tried to sue @entity30 ’s over this copy ( they ended up with just a few minor label changes ) , and i can see why			1
it tastes so similar it ’s incredible ! it ’s got the same amount of alcohol as @entity1 ’s , but there is a slightly stronger orange tang in pitchers , and — at a push — i would say it ’s sweeter , with less herbaceous notes			1
however , they ’ve done incredibly well at making a near - perfect version			2
verdict : hide the bottle and make up a pitcher			2
score : 5/5 jeeves from @entity107 £ 5.99 , 70cl ( £ 8.56 per litre ) my immediate reaction to this drink was it seemed less potent than @entity1 ’s , and indeed it is , with 17.5 per cent alcohol			1
also , it does n’t have any of @entity1 ’s bitter , complex flavours that make it such a clever drink			1
it just tastes like a sweet — and refreshing , mind — alcopop			0
perfectly acceptable for some , just not quite the same as @entity1 ’s			1
verdict : sweet and summery drink — good for those who really do n’t like the taste of alcohol , but not my cup of @entity1 ’s			1
score : 3/5 worthy contenders : jeeves from @entity107 is just £ 5.99 for 70cl ( left ) while @entity129 from @entity130 ( right ) is £ 21.35 for the same quantity @entity129 from @entity130 @entity132 , £ 21.35 , 70cl ( £ 30.50 a litre ) ideally you ’d make this up with ginger ale and a sprig of rosemary , as @entity129 suggests , but i wanted to keep this test consistent ( and i did n’t have any ginger ale to hand )			0
it ’s nothing like @entity1 ’s in taste or look — why on earth would @entity129 try to copy anyone — but it is rather lovely nonetheless , with flavours of red berries and blackcurrants , and interesting back notes of @entity151			1
verdict : it ’s pricey but makes an excellent alternative to @entity1 ’s			1
score : 4/5 @entity154 from @entity18 or @entity130 £ 15 , 50cl ( £ 30 a litre ) i was excited to try this as i love @entity154 gin , and the bottle is beautiful , but it ’s very alcoholic — 29 per cent — and tastes herbaceous rather than fruity			0
for me , it needs to be far more diluted than a @entity1 ’s — more like a @entity162			1
i far preferred it with tonic water and a squeeze of lemon			0
verdict : better for a fruity , evening @entity162 than a lunchtime @entity1 ’s - a - like			1
score : 3/5 @entity1 ’s @entity169 and @entity170 £ 9 , 70cl at @entity10 ; £ 12 , 1 litre at @entity6 ( until today ) , @entity130 this @entity1 ’s special edition sounds appealing — how can anyone not like blackberries or elderflower ? but it tastes just like cola cube sweets to me — sweet , with no bitter or herb notes , and no redeeming features			1
verdict : yuck ! is this aimed at children ? score : 0/5 bringing up the rear : @entity183 ( left ) is a traditional take on the original and is available for £ 15 for 50cl at @entity18			0
@entity1 's has brought out a special edition blackberry and elderflower flavour for the summer £ 9 for 70cl at @entity10 and £ 12 for 1 litre at @entity6 ( right ) @entity189 ’s @entity188 @entity187 £ 3 for 500g , @entity18 you ’d be hard - pushed to find bread better than @entity189 ’s and this is my favourite , made from a 15 - year - old wild yeast starter , and allowed to rise naturally to produce a complex , delicious loaf			1
