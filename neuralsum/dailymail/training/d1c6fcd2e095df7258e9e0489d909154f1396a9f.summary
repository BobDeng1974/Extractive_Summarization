according to a new research solicitation from @entity7 , the project , codenamed called @entity9 , for ' functional imaging to develop @entity11 ' will use magnetic image resonator scans to look for puppies that show potential			1
the project specifications say it will ' optimize the selection of ideal service dogs ' by scanning their brains to find the smartest candidates , while ' real - time neural feedback ' will help optimise training			1
@entity26 military member @entity23 , and his dog , @entity25 , break the world record for ' highest man / dog parachute deployment '			0
@entity29 now hope to screen puppies with mri scans to find the brightest for training ' this effort will capitalize on first - of - its - kind neural imaging feasibility work ; demonstrating functional brain activation in unrestrained dogs in response to handler cues , ' a document outlining the plan said			1
' the objective of this effort is two-fold ; first , to optimize the selection of ideal service dogs , both in operational military and therapy environments , and second , to use real - time neural feedback to optimize canine training , shortening training duration , reducing costs , and increasing learned responses			1
' the new scheme will scan the brains of puppies such as spaniels , often used as sniffer dogs , to discover those most likely to excel in the armed services dogs are used throughout the @entity26 military , to sniff for bombs , detect drugs and even take part in advanced missions - such as the mission to kill @entity62 , where the unidentified canine was lowered into the compound from a helicopter while strapped to a human member of the team			2

the @entity26 military is now planning to use mri scans to spot the most capable dogs the @entity2 reportedly has about 2,700 dogs , most bought from @entity78 , where the best breeding lines for such work are generally based			1
each dog costs around $ 20,000 to train			0
the agency believes it may be possible to use technology to screen ' high - value service dogs â€¦ based on their neutral activation to specific handler training cues , ' @entity7 said			2
dogs who show greater brain activity when given such cues will be ' faster and easier to train ' than dogs that show less activity			0
@entity26 @entity94 waits to begin a day of training and patroling at @entity96 in @entity97			0
dogs could soon be selected for training via mri scans of their brains as puppies the work could also help spot dogs suited for social tasks such as rehabilitation , it is claimed			1
' advances from this program could also be transitioned to the @entity111 , which is running a clinical trial on the impact of therapy dogs on the lives of veterans diagnosed with @entity117			0
' understanding the mechanism and communication between canine and human will facilitate therapy dog support for veterans with @entity117			0

functional imaging to develop @entity11 ( @entity9 ) scheme will use mri scans to *monitor* puppy reactions
@entity129 says scheme will allow it to ' optimize the selection of ideal service dogs '
