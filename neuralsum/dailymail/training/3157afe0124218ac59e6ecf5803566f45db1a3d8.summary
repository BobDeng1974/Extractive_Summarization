by @entity0 for @entity1 astronomers have found the first ever evidence for the huge stars that are thought to have populated the early universe			1
with a mass many hundred times that of the sun , they would have lived very short lives and none are still in existence today			0
however traces of one has now been found , and the potentially groundbreaking discovery could yield fascinating information about the early universe			2
astronomers using the @entity16 on @entity17 , @entity18 say they have found the first ever evidence for the universe 's first - generation of stars			1
it is thought these bodies exploded and ultimately gave rise to the heavy elements that formed the second - generation of stars the discovery was made using a technique called stellar archaeology by dr @entity32 and his colleagues at the @entity34 of @entity35 in @entity36 using the @entity16 on @entity17 , @entity18 , according a report in @entity38			1
first - generation stars are objects formed in the early universe ( within a few hundred million years after the @entity42 ) from gas clouds containing only hydrogen and helium			1
they are the probable precursors of the formation of the universe ’s structure and chemical enrichment ; large stellar systems , such as galaxies , formed later			2
maths simulations have made significant progress in understanding the formation of the first stars			0
recent simulations suggest that a small fraction of very - massive stars with masses exceeding one hundred times that of the @entity59 could have formed in the early universe , even though the large majority of first stars formed with masses of ten to a hundred times that of the @entity59 their strong ultraviolet radiation and energetic explosions are likely to have had a significant impact on the evolution of stellar systems			2
when these stars exploded they left behind the heavy elements that would lead to the formation of the second generation of stars			0
in turn these also exploded , paving the way to the third generation of stars that includes our sun. this technique involved analysing the chemical composition of a second - generation star to find evidence of one of the universe ’s first - generation of stars that led to its formation			1
by analysing such a star dr @entity32 ’s team say they discovered that it likely formed from the remnants of one of its older siblings			0
it is thought first - generation stars were the first to fuse hydrogen and helium into heavier elements that would come to make up other objects like planets , and other stars			1
they are so old that they would have preceded most galaxies in the universe , but owing to their huge mass they lived lives of just a few million years			0
scientists believe the universe began in the @entity42 13.8 billion years ago , but 800 million years later almost all of the first - generation stars had exploded in supernovae			1
@entity126 is known about these stars , but now the chemical signature of one has been found in one of younger siblings			1
when they exploded as supernovae , they created the first heavy elements that would ultimately lead to stars and galaxies			0
the evidence for this early star came in the remnants of a second - generation star called @entity141 - 0939			1
observations of its chemical composition suggest it formed from a cloud of gas seeded with material from the explosion of a single , more massive star - namely , a first - generation star			1
‘ the impact of very - massive stars and their explosions on subsequent star formation and galaxy formation should be significant , ’ dr @entity32 told @entity152			0
@entity158 , an astrophysicist at the @entity159 who was not involved in the study , added in nature : ‘ this is a much awaited discovery			0
’ ‘ it seems @entity32 et al			0
have finally found an old relic that shows intriguing evidence that there really was such a monstrous star in the distant past			0
’ the discovery was made with the @entity16 ( pictured )			0
the team found a chemical signature that must mean a younger star was made from one much older			1
if correct it would be the first evidence for a first - generation star ever found first - generation stars ( illustration shown ) are objects formed in the early universe ( within a few hundred million years after the @entity42 ) from gas clouds containing only hydrogen and helium			1
they are the probable precursors of the formation of the universe ’s structure and chemical enrichment second - generation stars are small , low - mass stars that have been around for about 13 billion years			1
their tiny levels of heavier elements suggest that they coalesced from the remnants of much larger , first - generation stars			2
while the @entity42 is thought to have happened about 13.8 billion years ago , evidence for stars in the first few hundred million years of the universe 's existence has been hard to come by			2
however , their existence has been inferred through the appearance of heavy elements after the @entity42			0
some elements in the universe could only originate in the cores of stars through the fusing of helium and hydrogen - and it must have been the elusive first - generation of stars that carried out the process			2
but until now , studies had failed to reveal the existence of these huge stars			0
further studies will be needed to confirm these findings are correct , but dr @entity32 and his team are hopeful that this could be a precursor to similar discoveries , perhaps with the help of @entity225 's @entity224 after it launches in 2018 .			0

astronomers using the @entity16 on @entity17 , @entity18 say they have found the first ever evidence for the universe 's first - generation of stars
the groundbreaking discovery was made in a second - generation star
the team found a chemical signature that must mean the younger star was made from one much older
if correct , it would be the first evidence for such a stellar body ever found
first - generation stars ultimately gave rise to the planets , galaxies and other objects in the universe today
