the @entity0 commands less public affection than @entity2 , @entity3 and the @entity4 after arguably the most humiliating year in its history , according to a survey of @entity8 ’s top brands			1
the taxpayer - funded broadcaster has been almost permanently engulfed in controversy in the past year , including allegations of a cover - up over the @entity14 sex abuse scandal			1
it also faced fury over its ‘ inane ’ coverage of the @entity18 and bumper pay deals for top presenters and managers			1
the sign at the @entity0 's @entity23 : the state broadcaster commands less public affection than @entity25 , @entity3 and the @entity4 according to a survey of @entity8 's top brands and the reputational body blows have taken their toll , according to a survey due to be released tomorrow by brand consultancy @entity30 , part of advertising firm @entity32			1
just 37 per cent of respondents said the @entity0 was a ‘ desirable ’ brand , putting it behind @entity3 , @entity2 and the @entity4			2
and only 30 per cent said they would describe the @entity0 - funded by a £ 145.50 licence fee from every household with a tv - as reliable			1
the miserable rating means that the @entity8 feel they can depend just as much on fast - food chain @entity39 as they can on the public service broadcaster			1
@entity42 , chief executive of @entity30 , said that people was prepared to forgive one mistake , but had grown tired of the @entity0 after an unrelenting series of failures			2
‘ the challenge the @entity0 has had is that it ’s had more than one or two crises and scandals , ’ he said			2
‘ that really begins to damage a brand over time			2
’ scandal : major controversy has blown up at the @entity0 over allegations of a cover - up of @entity14 's crimes ' inane ' : the broadcaster also faced fury over its coverage of the @entity61 ¿ s @entity60 earlier this year the survey took in responses from 20,000 consumers and analysed 678 brands in 25 categories			1
@entity8 ’s least desirable brand was newsagent chain @entity68 , which was rooted to the bottom , below even pile cream @entity70			2
with concerns over the use of personal data reaching fever pitch , @entity72 slipped down the ranks of the most reliable brand , with just 6 per cent of those surveyed saying they could depend on it			2
that placed the social network below state - owned bank @entity84 and even one rung beneath no - frills airline @entity87			1
but the @entity89 airline came bottom of the pile when respondents were asked to name a ‘ brand i respect ’			0
alongside @entity95 , @entity87 scraped a measly 5 per cent			0
new parents may not see the glamour in changing nappies , but the survey revealed that @entity100 was equally as ‘ desired ’ as @entity102 fashion house @entity101			0
technology giant @entity103 dominated the list of the @entity8 ’s most desirable brands , occupying four of the top 20 spots , although it lost ground to fast - growing rival @entity108			1
@entity103 itself topped the table , with its @entity111 in second , the @entity114 music service in sixth place and the @entity117 tablet computer further back in eighth			0
and there were some surprises as @entity121 defied its own marketing premise that you either love it or loathe it			0
the supposedly divisive toast spread was in fifth place , just behind upmarket jeweller @entity126 and well ahead of @entity127 in 18th			0
what everyone wants : technology giant @entity103 dominated the list of the @entity8 's most desirable brands , occupying four of the top 20 spots , although it lost ground to fast - growing rival @entity108 anger against @entity131 over its minute tax contribution in the @entity8 saw it lose 38 points on the brand desirability scale			1
but @entity135 , which was also embroiled in the tax controversy , managed to climb 3 points after responding to fears of a public boycott by offering to pay more corporation tax			1
despite @entity141 being named among the companies siphoning profit out of the @entity8 to avoid tax , it came in at seventh place			0
mr @entity42 said the tax controversy hit @entity131 particularly hard because it coincided with fears about the amount of personal data that the web giant collects and anger over search results that allowed access to child pornography			1
‘ there ’s less goodwill to fall back on , ’ he said			0
the @entity157 produced as many surprises for its top sponsors as it did on the athletics track			0
the constant sight of billboards for brands such as @entity164 and @entity165 , hardly known for their health credentials , seemed to turn @entity157 fans off			0
@entity164 fell 1 per cent in terms of its impact on consumers , wihle @entity165 was the biggest loser , faling 21 per cent			0
‘ there are an awful lot of brands that had very little association with the values and personalities of the @entity157 , ’ said mr @entity42			0
‘ it can buy you some short - term association , but if there ’s no logic it does n’t help the brand			1
’ surprisngly , oil giant @entity184 proved the summer sports event ’s big winner , up 70 per cent			0
the rise saw @entity184 rebound sharply from the biggest crisis in its history , when the devastating @entity190 blackened both its reputation and the waters of the @entity193 .			0
