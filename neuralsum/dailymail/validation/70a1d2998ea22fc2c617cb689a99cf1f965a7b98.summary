archaeologists have uncovered a stone tool in @entity2 that suggests humans occupied the western @entity4 earlier than thought			1
the agate tool was uncovered under a thick layer of volcanic ash dating back to the eruption of @entity10 15,800 years ago			1
scientists believe the primitive knife , discovered 12ft ( 3.6 metres ) below ground , was used for cutting animal hides , butchering meat , and carving wood by pre-clovis people			1
archaeologists have uncovered a stone tool in @entity2 that suggests humans occupied the western @entity4 earlier than thought			1
the agate tool was uncovered under a thick layer of volcanic ash dating back to the eruption of @entity10 15,800 years ago the find , at @entity26 , was announced today by the @entity4 @entity27 , which controls the land on which the site was found			1
archaeologist @entity30 said that if the age of the area holds up to scrutiny , it would be the oldest pre-clovis find west of the @entity36			1
it would also be older than another predating the so - called @entity39 culture , once generally believed to be the first people to migrate from @entity41 into @entity42			2
the earliest @entity39 artifacts , known for distinctive and elegant stone points , are dated to about 13,000 years ago			2
professor @entity45 from @entity46 called the find ' tantalising			2
' the find , at @entity26 , was announced today by the @entity4 @entity27 , which controls the land on which the site was found			1
archaeologist @entity30 said that if the age of the area holds up to scrutiny , it would be the oldest west of the @entity36 but he added that they want to continue digging this summer to see whether the volcanic ash covers the entire area			1
@entity56 , professor of archaeology at the @entity58 , said the scientific community would be skeptical			0
two pre-clovis sites are well documented and generally accepted by scientists			0
one is @entity62 , located about 60 miles southwest of the @entity64 site			2
the other is @entity66 in @entity67			0
both are dated about 1,000 years before the oldest @entity39 sites			2
if the date of @entity72 holds up , it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier , at the end of the @entity77 era , when mastodons , mammoths , camels , horses and bison roamed the area			1
much of discoveries at these sites indicate the people were involved in hunting , gathering and fishing , for which they used bone tools			2
some sites suggest that pre-clovis people sometimes lived in hut clusters			2
many were situated along the coastline , suggesting a marine lifestyle			0
many archaeologists favour the theory that they came over the @entity100 crossing from northeastern @entity41			0
' no one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in that ash layer , that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up , and until it is published in a convincing way , ' he said			1
' until then , extreme skepticism is all they are going to get			0
' two pre-clovis sites are well documented and generally accepted by scientists , @entity56 said			0

the find has yet to be submitted to a scientific journal for publication , but it has been reported in newsletters and at conferences			0
@entity30 found the site several years ago , while taking a break from carrying supplies to a session of the @entity139 nearby that @entity45 was overseeing			1
he said he noticed an outcropping of an ancient lava flow , with some very tall sage brush growing in front of it , indicating very deep sediment deposits			0
@entity26 is located near @entity2 in @entity146 in southeast @entity2			1
if the date of @entity72 holds up , it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier , at the end of the @entity77 era , when mastodons , mammoths , camels , horses and bison roamed the area the soil was black in front of the rock , indicating someone regularly built cooking fires there for a long time			1
an ancient streambed ran by , which would have given people more reason to stay there			0
and on the surface , he found a stone point of the stemmed type , found at sites both older and younger than @entity39			0
similar points have been found at @entity62 volunteers looking around the surface found some 30 stemmed points , and the field school started excavations in 2011 , @entity45 said			0
uncovered above and below the volcanic ash layer were fragments of teeth believed to be from ancient camels			1
tests by @entity181 of @entity182 on blood residue on the agate scraper were consistent with the bovid family of animals , @entity30 said			0
the most likely bovine animal living in @entity2 at that time would have been an ancestor of the buffalo .			2

the agate tool was uncovered under a thick layer of volcanic ash
it was used for cutting hides , butchering meat , and carving wood
find was made at @entity26 in southeast @entity2
if the date of @entity72 holds up , it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier that thought , at the end of the @entity77 era
