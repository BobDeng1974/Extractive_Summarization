by @entity0 accused : @entity1 could be imprisoned by mps until 2015 a policeman accused of lying in the ‘ @entity6 ’ row involving former cabinet minister @entity5 faces the extraordinary prospect of being forced to make a humiliating apology to the @entity9			1
a powerful commons committee is considering putting detective sergeant @entity1 ‘ on trial ’ after he was accused of falsely denying having called home secretary @entity11 ‘ that woman ’			1
@entity2 are deciding whether to summon det sgt @entity1 to ‘ the bar of the @entity9 ’ – a punishment not used for more than half a century			1
if he refuses to apologise for allegedly misleading them , @entity2 – in theory – have the power to jail him for the rest of this @entity21 , not due to end until may 2015			1
however that is unlikely to happen			2
the row follows det sgt @entity1 ’s appearance with two fellow @entity26 officials at the @entity27 last week to answer claims they gave a false account of a meeting with mr @entity5 in october last year			1
the officers said mr @entity5 refused to give a full account of what he had said in @entity34 , when he was accused of calling police ‘ f * * * * * * plebs ’ after they stopped him cycling through the gates			0
he was forced to resign a week later			0
but a recording of the meeting made by mr @entity5 , and published recently , revealed they had misrepresented him			0
according to the transcript , det sgt @entity1 said the men had problems with ‘ that woman the @entity47 have ’ – mrs may			1
the alleged remark was made at a time when the home secretary was imposing budget cuts on forces			1
conservative mp @entity54 , a member of the @entity27 , told det sgt @entity1 the remark was ‘ disgraceful ’			1
the officer denied saying it and told @entity2 there must have been a ‘ typing error ’ , adding : ‘ i do n’t recall using the term “ this woman ”			0
’ grilling : the three police officers embroiled in the @entity6 scandal appear before the @entity27 when the meeting finished , chairman @entity65 told the officers : ‘ we have found your evidence most unsatisfactory			0
’ he reminded them that to give false witness to a parliamentary committee is ‘ a prima facie contempt of @entity21 ’			0
it is believed the committee has written to det sgt @entity1 to inform him the transcript indicates he called mrs may ‘ that woman ’ – and inviting him to admit he lied and to apologise			1
if he refuses , the @entity2 may use their historic sanction to ‘ admonish ’ offenders for misleading @entity21 by summoning them to the ‘ bar ’ – directly facing the speaker			0
he would then be invited to say sorry			0
if he refuses , mps can vote to reprimand him , or , in theory , imprison him			2
the last member of the public to be summoned to the bar was former @entity88 editor sir @entity87 in january 1957 , after he published an article criticising politicians ’ petrol allowances			0
' that woman ' : @entity1 allegedly made a ' disgraceful ' reference to home secretary @entity11 , pictured he was rebuked by mps for failing to ‘ establish the truth of the article ’ and not being willing to ‘ admit its obvious implications ’			1
he apologised and no further action was taken			0
pressure on det sgt @entity1 also mounted last night after he received a public rebuke from his boss , @entity103 chief constable @entity102			2
in a letter to mr @entity5 , mr @entity102 lambasted det sgt @entity1 for using the incident to ‘ campaign against police cuts ’			2
det sgt @entity1 was unavailable for comment last night .			2

detective sergeant @entity1 could be punished on the orders of mps
he could be forced to apologise over an alleged remark about @entity11
if he refuses he could even be jailed *-* though this is unlikely to happen
