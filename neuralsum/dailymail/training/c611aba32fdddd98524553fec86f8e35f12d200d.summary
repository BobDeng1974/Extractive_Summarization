@entity0 scored 130 times for @entity2 – but says even he would struggle for goals in @entity5 ’s side			1
the @entity7 coach remains the only @entity8 to win the @entity9 following his 30 @entity11 goals in red and white in 2000			1
@entity0 takes on his old club this weekend – a match he admits is a meeting of relegation rivals – but says he has sympathy with the likes of @entity19 and @entity20			2
@entity0 scored 130 times for @entity2 but says he would struggle for goals in @entity5 ’s side the @entity2 have n't found the net nearly enough this season and are struggling at the foot of the table @entity2 boss @entity5 is one of a number of top - flight coaches who prefer to deploy a lone striker - his side , however , have failed to score in five of 11 league games this season			1
@entity0 , meanwhile , had @entity32 as a foil during his time at the @entity35 and told @entity36 he would not enjoy operating by himself in the current team			2
‘ @entity2 are no different to a lot of teams in using the system but it would have been interesting to see how i might have fared in it , ’ said the 41 - year - old , who is now one of @entity42 ’s trusted lieutenants at the @entity43			1
‘ i ’ve always backed myself to score goals but i ’m glad that so much of my career was spent as one of a pair of strikers			0
‘ i did play one up front towards the end of my time at @entity2 but i do n’t think it was a system which suited us at the time and i did n’t really enjoy it			0
’ @entity0 helped @entity2 to successive seventh - placed finishes under @entity59 at the turn of the @entity61 and won eight @entity63 caps during that period			1
@entity0 was the epitome of a fox in the box while playing at the @entity35 his partnership with @entity32 remains one of the last examples of a devastating duo in the @entity11 era , and he added : ‘ they were fantastic times for the club and we seemed to score for fun , but i had big @entity32 alongside me and i think almost every striker prefers to play in a two up front			1
‘ he created a lot of chances for me , took a lot of the pressure off me and that was one of the secrets to our success			0
’ @entity7 , for the large part , have played two up front this season with @entity88 supported by either @entity89 or @entity90			0
but @entity0 accepts they are in the minority			0
‘ it ( one up front ) is the modern way , ’ he said			0
‘ but it requires a specialist striker to really make it work			0
‘ and the key to it is that your midfield has got to be very effective at attacking and getting forward to support the frontman			0
’ @entity7 , meanwhile , have lost their last four and have slipped into the bottom three , which is where @entity2 resided until the win at @entity106 earlier this month			1
and @entity0 reflected : ‘ we have n’t done badly so far but the key to us staying up is doing well against the teams in and around us - and @entity2 come into that category			2
