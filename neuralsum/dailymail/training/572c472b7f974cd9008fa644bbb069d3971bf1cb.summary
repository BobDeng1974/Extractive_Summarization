their father , @entity1 , had disappeared from the scene , presumed guilty of the attacks			2
@entity10 and his sisters were cared for by relatives in the wake of the murder as the full scale of the horror emerged			1
in an interview with the @entity46 , @entity10 described how the memories of that night were still ' crystal clear ' in his mind but that he rarely revisited it in his head			2
the 29 - year - old nanny had been looking after @entity26 , his older sister @entity52 , then aged 10 , and four - year - old @entity54 - the youngest of the siblings - for six months he recalls how the evening had begun as it always did - with @entity34 tucking him up in bed with a cup of cocoa and blowing him a kiss , saying goodnight with her ' usual smile ' before turning out the lights			1
this was his last memory of his beloved nanny			1
within an hour she had been bludgeoned to death , his mother @entity68 seriously injured and his father had vanished			2
vanished : police believed @entity1 , left , killed @entity11 , right , after mistaking her for his wife @entity68 mystery : @entity1 , is believed to have killed the family nanny , and attacked his then - wife , @entity68 , pictured @entity10 had been in a deep sleep and had heard nothing of the incident			1
the first he knew something was wrong was when he was woken by a policeman standing by his bed , telling him to get dressed and leave the house			1
officers turned off all the lights in the house before guiding the children out , in a bid to hide the horror of the blood - splattered crime scene from them			1
he told the @entity46 : ' the officers turned off the lights in the hallway where there was blood on the walls and some terrible scenes of carnage			1
' there was so much blood and they did n’t want us to see it			2
' detective believed @entity1 killed @entity34 by mistake in the dark , that his intended target had been his estranged wife			0
the couple were in the middle of acrimonious divorce proceedings			0
they also believed that he attacked @entity68 when she disturbed her husband , before he fled the scene			0
revealed : lord @entity1 's son @entity10 tells his story in today 's @entity116 @entity10 added : ' i remember the police officers being very tense but trying to be very friendly			1
' there were several policemen , and a ­ couple of plain - clothes officers			2
my ­ sisters and i were gathered up and driven by a police car to my ­ grandmother ’s around the corner in @entity127 , where we stayed most of the night			2
i got plonked on the sofa and just went to sleep			0
' we were n’t told exactly what had happened but we were finger - printed at some stage			2
even us , despite the fact we were children			0
' they were reunited with their mother a week after the attack and the family went to stay with relatives			0
however , it was to be a whole nine months after the incident that the children were finally told that their father and nanny would not be coming home			1
the police named @entity1 as the prime suspect , but were unable to locate him , instead only finding a blood - stained car he was seen driving , abandoned at @entity150 , east @entity151			1
a coroner , in the absence of the prime suspect , declared in 1975 that @entity1 had indeed killed the pretty nanny			0
but @entity1 's son said he was certain that his father was not the ' prime mover ' in the situation			0
he added that he hoped he was partly culpable because it would make his abscondment easier to cope with			0
@entity10 believes that his father would not have absconded , leaving his children ( which included sisters @entity54 and @entity52 ) behind without real reason			1
and that 's why he hopes his father did have some part to play in that tragic night 's events			0
the graphic nature of the killing and in particular the amount of blood that was found at the scene , leads @entity10 to suspect that one or more parties were involved in the murder , yet he does not entirely discount his father being one of them			1
he does , however , disagree with the version of events according to his mother , with whom he no longer has contact with , believing that the state of her relationship with @entity1 at the time clouded her details of fact			0
@entity1 left two letters behind addressed to his brother in law @entity188 , written on the night of the murder			0
in these letters the tone is clear that he was not to return , giving details of his banking details and estate			0
lady @entity195 , left , pictured in @entity24 1994 and right , at the coroner 's inquest in 1975 the second letter , in particular , is most interesting			0
in it , he refers to a ' fight ' he broke up at the property , and that a man left following the assaults			0
however , speaking with a worry for the welfare for his children , @entity1 appears adamant that ' v ' ( @entity68 ) would make things difficult for him , and that he could n't face being charged with attempted murder			2
@entity10 hopes his no - hold - barred account of that horror night can put to bed many rumours that came out at the time , and are still prevalent today			1
some say @entity1 mistakenly killed @entity11 instead of his wife , as the lighting was poor in the house at the time			0
others say he hired a hitman to do his dirty work , and then escaped to @entity222 with the help of some of his high - powered friends			0
an assistant of zoo owner @entity227 revealed this year that she booked flights for @entity1 's children in 1979 and 1980 to visit a reserve in @entity222 - but in reality it was for @entity1 to see how his children had grown up			2
the children lived with their mother until 1982 until all custody was transferred to their aunt and uncle , @entity1 's sister @entity238 and her husband @entity188 , the recipient of @entity1 's letters .			0
