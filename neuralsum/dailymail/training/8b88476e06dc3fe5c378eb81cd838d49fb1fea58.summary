@entity0 might be forgiven for inviting the advances of @entity2 and escaping the @entity3 - for his last five matches have returned an aggregate score of 0 - 18			1
the @entity7 defender returns to the @entity9 top flight this weekend after eight months of painstaking rehab doing the 9 - 5 shift at the club ’s training ground in a bid to overcome a lingering knee injury			1
during that time there has been interest in the former @entity18 full back from their @entity20 rivals , but @entity0 - given his @entity18 debut by @entity23 - is instead targeting a new deal on @entity25			1
@entity0 ( left ) in @entity7 training last week as he aims to return after eight months out @entity0 trying to hold off @entity27 during a clash with @entity29 almost a year ago ‘ i am happy here - i still have one and a half years left on my contract and i will probably have to speak to @entity7 soon , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’ve always said i am happy here			2
’ before being struck down by injury in april of last season , however , @entity0 and his team - mates were far from happy			1
they were in the midst of a six - match losing run and boss @entity38 was coming under increasing pressure from the terraces			2
a 4 - 0 defeat at home by @entity43 would prove to be @entity0 's last outing for the man who brought him to @entity46 for £ 5million in 2011			1
the full back , battling @entity48 in a 2009 @entity2 derby , has been linked with a return to former club @entity18 @entity52 full back @entity0 advances with the ball during an under 21 match against @entity55 on monday before that , the @entity57 international had himself come in for criticism			1
indeed , his previous four matches had returned 4 - 0 losses against @entity62 and @entity63 and 3 - 0 reverses at the hands of @entity66 and @entity67			1
the last time he played in a side which scored was in january of last season during a 3 - 1 win at @entity71			2
@entity0 , though , says he is returning a stronger player for the pain of the past 12 months			1
‘ i have come back stronger			0
i 've been training hard for six months now and have been finishing at 5pm every day , ’ he said			0
‘ that is making me stronger			0
but now i just want to play - for my fitness and for myself			0
i am only 24 years old			0
@entity0 on the ball during training for @entity7 last week as he looks to make his top - level return ‘ but it has been difficult			1
my family helped me a lot - my fiancee and my baby and my mum and my dad - it was important to have all of those people around me			0
if you are by yourself , it 's difficult			0
it has been a long time			0
’ @entity0 was always a favourite under @entity38 but must now set about proving himself to a new boss and winning back his place in the team , lost to academy graduate @entity94			1
he added : ‘ now , for me , the competition is not a problem			0
i 'm used to that			0
i had a good time with @entity38 when he was here , and i wish him good luck			0
‘ now we have to go on to the next page and start a new chapter			0
’ @entity0 is no doubt relieved to close the book on what was a depressing 2014			2
