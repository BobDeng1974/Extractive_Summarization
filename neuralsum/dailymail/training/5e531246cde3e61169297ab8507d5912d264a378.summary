@entity1 ’s infamous sheriff @entity0 is now defending one of his famous friends after controversy caused by comments made at a roast in his honor			1
state senator @entity9 made racially charged jokes at @entity0 ’s expense during the recent roast since the sheriff is known for his tough stance on illegal immigration			1
a recording of the roast made public has caused outrage after the state lawmaker was heard insulting @entity21 to draw laughs from guests			1
on the hot seat : @entity26 ( @entity1 ) sheriff @entity0 is no stranger to controversy ‘ @entity0 is the kind of guy that you got ta love , as long as you have papers , ’ @entity28 can be heard saying on the recording made public by the @entity30			1
‘ going out with @entity0 is always an adventure , ’ he adds as the audience laughs , ‘ because usually when we walk into a restaurant , most of the waitstaff and cooks dive out the back window , and when they do n't , i never know what the hell 's in my food			2
’ those jokes and several similar quips have put @entity0 in the uneasy position of defending a man he calls a friend			2
controversial : @entity53 @entity28 's remarks may have drawn chuckles from his audience , but not everyone is laughing ‘ how many @entity21 did you pull over on the way over here , @entity0 , huh ? ’ @entity60 jokes			1
@entity28 also joked about the federal monitor appointed to oversee the @entity62 by a judge to limit racial profiling			2
‘ just to show you how unreasonable the federal monitor is			0
. when @entity0 sends his new deputies to the academy , he will no longer just train them to do the @entity69 in @entity70 , he will have to teach it in @entity72 too ’ @entity28 wisecracks			1
‘ the sign over the booking intake door in the jail will have to have ‘ welcome ’ and just not ‘ bienvenido , ’ he continues			0
@entity0 can be heard around this point saying ‘ that ’s enough , ’ but the state senator continued a bit longer before bidding the roaring crowd ‘ adios			1
’ ‘ it was a roast			0
he 's not a racist			0
he 's very funny , ’ @entity0 told @entity84			2
‘ so , he made these comments , i ca n't speak whether he went too far			0
’ but others , including the @entity30 , say @entity28 did push things too far , accusing the sheriff and his cohorts of continuing to ‘ dehumanize immigrants and treat @entity94 like second - class citizens			1
’ @entity28 declined to comment , but released a statement to the network calling the jokes ' satirical ' and ' not directed at minority group members but at the target of the roast - sheriff @entity0			1
' he accused the @entity30 of editing out non-racially - tinged portions of the roast and said that the jokes were ' typical of roasts and had i made the same jokes against @entity107 at their annual dinner			2
' he did not offer any apology for those who may have been offended by the comments			0
@entity0 tried changing the tables on his detractors during the @entity84 interview , asking where the outrage was when he was being called ‘ @entity117 and @entity118			0
’ ‘ why is n't there an uproar about going after me , calling me every name in the book ? why are they worried about just some roast ? ’ he asked			0
disallowed from racially profiling suspects to ask for immigration papers , @entity0 has come up with other ways to keep himself occupied including issuing pink underwear to county inmates and taking salt and pepper from their food , according to his office			0
last month , he put several inmates on a bread and water diet for defacing @entity138 flags in their cells while at the same time piping patriotic music into county detention centers .			0
