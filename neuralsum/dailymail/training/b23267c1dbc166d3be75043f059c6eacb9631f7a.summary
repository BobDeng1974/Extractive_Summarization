by @entity0 for the @entity1 the @entity4 ’s borders offer ‘ no hurdles ’ for @entity4 jihadis returning from @entity7 and @entity8 intent on launching a ‘ massacre of the innocents ’ , it was claimed last night			1
a former policeman warned that @entity14 fighters who had sneaked out of the country ‘ under the radar ’ of the police and security services would be ‘ welcomed home ’ by inadequate immigration controls at @entity4 airports			1
and he raised the terrifying prospect that unknown extremists could cause carnage on @entity4 streets using terror tactics learned on @entity28 battlefields , such as building homemade bombs			1
warning : @entity30 , former immigration officer , said calls to bolster border controls has fallen on deaf ears @entity30 , a retired @entity34 officer who worked intercepting suspected criminals at @entity4 airports for more than ten years , said repeated calls to successive @entity38 to bolster border controls had ‘ fallen on deaf ears ’			1
he said ministers were more concerned with preventing queues at airports than protecting the public – a claim described as ‘ utter rubbish ’ by the @entity46			2
mr @entity30 spoke out after @entity48 mp @entity47 claimed that as many as 2,000 @entity4 @entity49 had travelled to fight a ‘ holy war ’ in @entity7 and @entity8			1
the security services claim the number is 500 , with 250 having already returned			2
the @entity54 veteran , who served 32 years before leaving in 2011 , said it was ‘ scandalous ’ that embarkation controls had not been reintroduced after being scrapped by @entity48 in 1998			2
these controls were staffed by immigration officers who would examine passports and scrutinise passengers as they passed through to their flights			0
suspicious people would be flagged up to @entity34			0
but mr @entity30 said that nowadays body and hand baggage searches and passport checks would be conducted by private security guards employed by airport authorities or airline personnel as they boarded their planes			1
he claimed ‘ 99 out of 100 ’ passengers would not pass ‘ under the eyes ’ of a @entity4 counter-terrorism officer			1
instead , hard - pressed officers would monitor ‘ target ’ flights at the airport gates – those heading for certain destinations			0
for instance , flights to @entity79 – often used as a transit point by @entity4 muslims travelling to @entity8 – might be monitored			1
fears : more than 500 @entity4 are feared to be fighting for @entity84 and could come home mr @entity30 said that on their return to @entity4 , extremists who had not come to the attention of the security services would face little attention at passport control			1
he said @entity93 officers were discouraged from asking even the most basic questions of travellers			0
instead they simply scan passports against terror and criminal watchlists and compare the photograph in the document with the person in front of them – another claim vehemently denied by the @entity46			0
mr @entity30 said : ‘ the medieval savagery inflicted upon @entity107 by , in all probability , a @entity4 national and the perceived support of the @entity4 government for those ranged against this so - called @entity113 can only bring the prospect of a “ massacre of the innocents ” in the @entity4 even closer			1
‘ there is clearly still a very real need to prevent further individuals from leaving the @entity4 to engage in acts of terror in other parts of the world			1
‘ an equal priority needs to ensure that jihadists returning to the @entity4 are detected and arrested before they can inflict mayhem in our towns and cities			2
‘ if that means that the priority of avoiding air and sea port passenger queues has to be removed then so be it			0
‘ police and security services have performed outstandingly well in frustrating a number of planned attacks yet the increasing numbers of @entity4 jihadists suggests that their task is becoming almost impossible			2
‘ thus the case for strengthening our borders by reintroducing exit controls and strengthening passport controls upon arrival is surely an unanswerable one			0
currently there are practically no hurdles			0
’ mr @entity47 , mp for @entity149 , said : ‘ the government has not got a handle on how to deal with people coming in and out of the country – people are coming and going as they please without being asked any questions			0
‘ they might have been in the @entity28 for education or employment , but at least ask them			0
’ the @entity46 said embarkation controls were being reintroduced next spring to boost intelligence on who was in the @entity4			2
a source at the department said border officers had vast terror and criminal databases at their fingertips			0
some 95 per cent of travellers arriving at @entity4 ’s airports underwent checks			1
he said border officers routinely questioned arriving passengers and said it was ‘ utter rubbish ’ to suggest the @entity93 prioritised queues over security .			0
