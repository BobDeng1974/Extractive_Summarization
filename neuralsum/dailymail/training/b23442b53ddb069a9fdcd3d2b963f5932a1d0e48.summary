@entity0 last night received a £ 1.5 million donation from left - wing firebrand @entity3 ’s trade union @entity2			1
the union said it gave the cash to @entity7 ’s general election campaign fund because of fears the conservatives could be elected in may on a ‘ tide of big business cash ’			1
the @entity12 said the donation would ‘ not come for free ’ , highlighting a series of policy demands made by @entity2			1
all smiles : the donation came as @entity0 , pictured with @entity7 leader @entity16 yesterday , spoke approvingly of ‘ redistribution ’ of money from the better - off to the poor proposals approved at its most recent conference included a 400 per cent increase in the dole , the reversal of all spending cuts and the repeal of @entity30 ’s anti-strike laws			1
the unite cash boost for @entity7 came as mr @entity0 spoke approvingly of ‘ redistribution ’ of money from the better - off to the poor and refused to rule out a coalition deal with the resurgent @entity35			1
on a campaign visit to @entity37 , he backed @entity40 leader @entity16 ’s suggestion that a new ‘ mansion tax ’ , largely raised from homeowners in the @entity45 , should fund 1,000 new nurses north of the border			2
former @entity7 leadership candidate @entity46 has accused him of trying to ‘ buy @entity37 votes with money expropriated from @entity49 ’			1
but mr @entity0 said : ‘ on the issue of the mansion tax … some of the powerful , the super-rich and the famous are going to protest louder and louder about paying a little more			0
@entity53 : @entity3 is the leader of the @entity2 - and a powerful force over the @entity55 ' when homes costing hundreds of millions of pounds pay the same in property tax as homes a fraction of that value , the case for the mansion tax to fund the @entity65 is getting stronger and stronger by the day			1
‘ what is the principle at stake here ? the principle at stake in this argument about the mansion tax is actually the principle of redistribution and equality			0
’ mr @entity0 insisted his party can still win a @entity75 - wide majority , and hold all its @entity37 seats – despite polls suggesting dozens of @entity78 will fall victim to an @entity81 surge			2
but just days after shadow chancellor @entity82 ruled out a post-election deal with the @entity81 should labour fall short of a majority , mr @entity0 left the door open			0
political football : @entity87 has not ruled out a deal to rule with @entity7 if there is a hung parliament he would say only : ‘ i have one focus , which is a majority @entity7 government			1
’ challenged that he was not ruling out a deal , mr @entity0 replied : ‘ i could n’t be clearer			0
@entity16 [ @entity16 ] said we “ do n’t need , we do n’t want and we ’re not planning that ” and that ’s my position too			2
’ former @entity37 first minister @entity87 , who is attempting to return to the @entity98 in may , suggested last night he was angling for a coalition – and claimed he is more popular in @entity100 than either @entity101 or mr @entity0			2
‘ there ’s every chance of the @entity81 becoming the third biggest party in the @entity75 in may , ’ he told the @entity103 website			2
‘ the political stars are aligning for a balanced parliament			0
neither @entity101 nor @entity0 are capable of or deserve a majority , and that leaves space for a hugely substantial @entity81 influence			0
‘ the problem for the @entity12 , and @entity7 for that matter , is that i ’m certainly more popular than @entity101 and @entity0 in @entity100			1
definitely less unpopular , anyway – let ’s put it that way			0
’ @entity118 leader @entity118 warned of the dangers of a post-election coalition involving the @entity81 or @entity121 , suggesting it would make the ‘ fiercest critics of this coalition slightly more benevolent about it ’			0
the @entity12 said that almost 70 per cent of donations to @entity7 under mr @entity0 had come from the trade unions			1
between 2010 and the third quarter of last year , they said @entity7 had received £ 35.4 million from the trade unions , out of £ 51.3 million total donations			1
@entity2 has donated £ 12.8 million to @entity7 – a quarter of all donations received since mr @entity0 became leader in september 2010			1
@entity135 vice-chairman @entity134 said : ‘ this huge latest donation from @entity2 does n’t come for free			2
we all know @entity3 and @entity2 buy @entity7 ’s policies , choose @entity7 ’s leader and pick @entity7 ’s candidates			1
‘ just three months away from the most important general election of our generation , the choice could n’t be clearer : between a competent @entity135 government that stands up for hard - working @entity75 taxpayers and an incompetent @entity55 under @entity0 who ’s too weak to stand up to his trade union paymasters			1
’ labour fury at ' @entity150 link ' @entity7 has reacted with fury to claims the party approached @entity150 over propping up @entity0 in @entity154			2
it followed allegations that senior figures were ‘ badgering ’ the @entity158 mps about voting with @entity7 in the event it lacked the seats to form a government			1
the @entity12 issued a poster showing mr @entity0 on the steps of no 10 @entity154 , with his arm around @entity87 , alongside @entity165 , prompting a senior @entity7 frontbencher to accuse the @entity12 of fighting the election campaign ‘ in the gutter ’			1
anger : @entity7 has reacted with fury to this ' pro @entity150 ' poster produced by the conservative party @entity174 , the shadow @entity176 , said : ‘ @entity150 have said that this story is “ pure fiction ” , and that no discussions have taken place			2
‘ @entity7 ’s record as an honest broker in @entity183 speaks for itself			1
‘ the @entity12 clearly intend to fight this election in the gutter			2
’ yesterday there were claims – confirmed by @entity150 – that a @entity135 mp had also approached the party to find out if their mps might take their seats in the event of a hung @entity193			0
a senior @entity7 source denied the party was ‘ cosying up ’ to @entity150 , but refused to rule out a coalition , saying only : ‘ we are working towards a majority @entity7 government			1
’ a senior @entity135 source said there was ‘ zero prospect ’ of a @entity135 deal with @entity150			0
one of the key opinion formers during the election campaign will be the @entity206			0
the corporation – accused by the @entity12 of having a left - wing bias – is bound by its charter to be politically even - handed			1
the @entity210 will monitor the service to see if it lives up to its obligations			0
under the headline , ‘ care spending cut by fifth in 10 years ’ , the story led the @entity206 website and featured heavily on radio and tv news bulletins on wednesday			0
it implied that the amount of public money spent on elderly care had been slashed by an alarming 20 per cent in the past decade			0
in cash terms , spending on home and residential care between 2003/04 and 2013/14 actually increased by 20 per cent , from £ 7.37 billion to £ 8.84 billion			2
even adjusted for inflation it went down by only 6 per cent – regrettable , of course , but hardly a catastrophic fall in a time of austerity			0
to get to their dramatic 20 per cent cut , the @entity206 arbitrarily divided the spending totals for 2003/04 and 2013/14 by the number of over- 65s in the population for each of those years , to get a per capita spending figure			0
as the population has risen sharply in the past decade – and with it the number of over- 65s – spending per capita was bound to fall between 2004 and 2014			0
but this per capita figure takes no account of changing care needs and costs , whether the over- 65s have become fitter in the past ten years , whether more choose or are able to live at home – with or without social services help – than go into a nursing home , or whether more are being taken in by their families			0
so is it a realistic calculation , or an interpretation of the statistics most likely to embarrass the @entity257 ? the @entity206 replied : ‘ we worked with an @entity269 statistician who was on secondment to the @entity206 on this analysis , the @entity258 provided the spending figures and we ran the findings past the @entity262			0
no one raised any issues with our approach and we set out clearly in all our coverage what we did and why			0
