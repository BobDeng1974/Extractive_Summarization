cashing in : bookies are taking bets on everything from the baby 's birthday to its name and hair colour @entity7 has emerged as a clear favourite for the name of the little prince last night – at least among the betting public			1
at 2/1 , it overtook the earlier leader among boys ’ names , @entity16 , which is now 5/1 as is @entity17 – prince @entity19 ’s real name			1
most punters had clearly expected a girl , with @entity22 the favourite at 7/4			0
@entity24 said the royal birth was the biggest non-sporting betting event in the company ’s history with cash staked on everything including hair colour and weight			1
the name the @entity34 and @entity35 choose will set a trend for a generation of babies , with other new parents having a boy anxious to copy them			1
@entity7 has links to both families , but @entity43 already has a cousin called @entity7 - the @entity45 and @entity47 's son @entity46			1
@entity16 has been the name of six @entity49 of @entity50 and was the @entity49 name of the @entity53 ’s father , @entity52 , whose actual first name was @entity55			1
it is also one of @entity16 ’ middle names			2
from @entity60 ’s side of the family both his father ’s name , which the @entity16 share with princess @entity66 ’s brother , @entity65 , and his grandfather ’s are likely favourites			2
at the bookies however , @entity16 did not even hit top ten with @entity72 , and @entity73 will take home 40 times the money if they win			1
the @entity75 are also likely to take inspiration from @entity35 's side of the family , possibly honouring her father @entity79 , or picking @entity80 , which is both her father and her grandfather 's middle name			1
princess @entity66 's middle name was @entity66 , the feminine form of the name , meaning @entity43 could honour his mother 's memory through his son			0
less likely are older @entity91 family names such as @entity35 's maternal grandfather , who was called @entity93 , however @entity94 appears several times on both sides of @entity35 's family			1
the announcement that the @entity35 was in labour sent punters to the betting shops , and bookmaker @entity102 said they took £ 390,000 in bets in the three hours after this morning 's news			1
odds with @entity24 this morning wrongly predicted a girl , with with odds of 1 - 2 , while the odds on a boy stood at 6 - 4			2
the bookmaker said the baby 's birth has been the biggest non-sporting event in the company 's history			1
1 ) @entity7 ( 2/1 ) 2 ) @entity16 ( 5/1 ) 3 ) @entity17 ( 5/1 ) 4 ) @entity149 ( 20/1 ) 5 ) louis ( 25/1 ) 6 ) @entity55 ( 40/1 ) 7 ) @entity150 ( 40/1 ) 8 ) @entity151 ( 40/1 ) 9 ) @entity152 ( 40/1 ) 10 ) @entity153 ( 40/1 ) had there been a princess born this afternoon , the most popular names were @entity22 , with the odds 9/4 and @entity158 at 5/1			1
once the @entity34 and @entity35 have given their baby boy his names , @entity53 will be informed of the before they are announced officially , but she is unlikely to exercise her veto			1
royal writer @entity162 said : ' @entity53 is so down to earth that she 's not likely to jump up and down and say this boy has got to be called @entity16 and @entity16			1
' this is n't going to be " @entity166 , do you approve ? " but more ' these are the names we 've chosen - do you like them ? '			0
' it 's much more of a personal thing these days			0
' despite their freer rein , it is unlikely that @entity43 and @entity35 would pick a name out of keeping with royal tradition , and they will be mindful of choosing a name that befits a future king or queen			2
in the past , the approval of the sovereign has held great importance			0
when the @entity34 and @entity184 had their second daughter @entity185 in 1930 , they were planning to call her @entity186 , but changed their mind after learning that @entity188 disliked the name @entity190 queen @entity191 insisted that the name @entity55 be used as a middle name , if not a first , in honour of her beloved consort @entity55			2
prime position : @entity197 , who has been living on a bench outside the hospital for over a week waits patiently not much longer now ! some people have been staying outside the hospital 's private wing for several days fan : royal supporter @entity204 poses with his royal baby memorabilia as he waits across the street from @entity114 royal babies ' names are not usually revealed straight away and the public are often left guessing for several days as speculation mounts			1
when princess @entity212 was born in 1988 , it was two weeks before her name was known			0
when @entity43 arrived in 1982 , his parents waited seven days before deciding upon and announcing his name			0
@entity66 was thought to have preferred names such as @entity218 and @entity219 , while @entity16 was reportedly holding out for @entity55			2
@entity16 's own name , however , remained a mystery for an entire month and was only declared ahead of his christening in the @entity223 of @entity224 in december 1948			1
in a more modern approach , @entity43 and @entity35 could buck the trend and unveil their chosen name immediately			0
royal babies tend to be given a number of middle names			0
the @entity232 has four names - @entity16 - while the @entity34 also has four - @entity43			1
dedication : @entity235 and @entity236 who have sailed down from @entity237 on their narrowboat to be near the hospital for the royal birth			0
with a top speed of 4mph the journey took two months the @entity53 has three names - @entity53 - while @entity43 's mother @entity66 , was @entity66			2
@entity246 of @entity34 has just two names , @entity35			1
prince @entity19 's first name is actually @entity17 , followed by @entity152			2
@entity249 , who abdicated the throne , had seven names - @entity251 - but was always known to his family as @entity152			0
queen @entity191 was named @entity191 and as a child was nicknamed @entity255			0
the baby will be styled hrh @entity232 [ forename ] of @entity34			2
when @entity43 was born he was @entity43 and his children will use @entity34 in the same way			0
according to the monarchy 's official website : ' for the most part , members of the @entity262 who are entitled to the style and dignity of @entity232 prince or @entity212 do not need a surname , but if at any time any of them do need a surname ( such as upon marriage ) , that surname is @entity272			0
' parents - to - be : the @entity34 is at his wife 's side as she is in labour with their first child today in 1917 , @entity188 adopted @entity272 as the royal family 's @entity279 and surname			2
in 1960 , for the direct descendants of the @entity53 and the @entity153 who require a surname , it became @entity272			0
' this is the biggest non-sporting event in our company 's history ' - @entity24 spokesman @entity291 was the surname @entity292 - born prince @entity153 assumed when he became naturalised in 1947			1
if a boy , the baby is also likely to one day be @entity232 when @entity43 accedes to the throne			0
the title is usually given to the male heir to the throne , but it is not automatic			0
bookies are already cashing in after due dates backed by the punters passed by without a baby			1
the most popular day for due - date bets was last thursday , july 18 , when 1,142 people lost money with @entity307 alone			0
one punter was down £ 1,000 after putting their money on july 17 , and the company will make £ 23,000 after getting to midnight last night without a royal baby			0
meanwhile @entity24 says it has already made £ 25,000 from lost bets			0
@entity72 said it had already taken £ 100,000 in due date bets but could not say how many people had lost out as all bets remain open until the baby is born .			0

*fevered* speculation on @entity34 and @entity35 of @entity34 's baby name
@entity7 , @entity16 , and @entity17 are all considered strong *contenders*
the @entity53 will be informed of the baby 's name before it 's announced
bookmakers reap rewards from punters who backed due dates last week
birth is the biggest non-sporting event in our history , say bookies @entity24
