health tracking apps and bands have many uses , but they ’re limited because they still need you to enter your eating habits manually			1
but , researchers are hoping to change this using a sensor , worn around the ear , that automatically tracks how much people eat			1
cameras fitted to the device also snap images of the food as it enters the mouth to determine calorie content and other nutrient information			1
called @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , the device lets wearers track eating habits			1
a sensor , worn around the ear ( pictured ) monitors movements of the jaw			1
it is activated by vibrations caused by chewing , and filters out movements made by talking			1
the camera captures images of food to estimate its calorie content as well as being easier to track food intake , the sensor has the potential to be more accurate than current , manual entries , explained the researchers from the @entity37			1
called @entity19 , or @entity40 , its creators also claim it has potential to improve weight - loss , and help doctors discover eating patterns in overweight patients			1
the sensor works by monitoring vibrations in the jaw , made when people chew and is so sophisticated , it can filter out other motions , including talking and yawning			1
earlier this year , researchers from @entity52 created a chin strap that harvests energy from jaw movements , including chewing and talking			1
it is hoped the device could soon be used to power electronic devices , such as hearing aids , cochlear implants , and even phones			0
the strap is made from a smart material known as @entity64			0
@entity64 is a type of piezoelectric material made up of integrated electrodes , and an adhesive polymer matrix			0
the material is able to produce an electric charge when it stretches , and is subjected to mechanical stress			0
jaw movements proved to be one of the most promising candidates for generating electricity from human body movements , with researchers estimating that an average of around seven microwatts of power could be generated from chewing during meals alone			2
pictures of the food and drink are compared to an online database , using image recognition , and compared against a list of nutritional information			2
and , because the device is wearable , it could additionally double - up as a pedometer or activity tracker to compare exercise levels against calorie intake			2
dr. @entity98 , an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the university : ‘ weight gain comes from an unbalance of the energy we take in versus the energy we expend			0
‘ we can estimate diet and nutrient intake , but the primary method is self - reporting			0
' the sensor could provide objective data , helping us better understand patterns of food intake associated with obesity and eating disorders			2
’ already proven viable , further work is being carried out to update the device , make it smaller and more robust , and boost its accuracy			0
dr @entity98 intends to test the @entity19 ’s accuracy as an alternative method to tracking energy use from water samples			2
this current method measures the body ’s elimination rate of stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen added to the water , a process that can take two weeks			0
the information can be used to estimate how many calories a person consumes over a period of time , but is expensive and requires medical expertise			0

the strap , ( pictured ) is made from a material known as @entity64 , which consists of electrodes and adhesive polymer that produces a charge when it stretches it ’s likely @entity19 ’s first application would be as a medical device , but @entity98 said it ’s possible it could become a consumer device that would eliminate the need for health - conscious people to keep a record of their diet			1

called @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , it lets wearers track eating habits
the sensor is worn around the ear and monitors movements of the jaw
activated by vibrations made by chewing , it filters out talking and yawning
camera automatically captures images of food to estimate its calorie content
the device then provides the wearer , and doctors , with *detailed* information
