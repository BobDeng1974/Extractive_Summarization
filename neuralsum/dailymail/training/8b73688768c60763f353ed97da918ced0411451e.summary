@entity0 put himself in the running for the worst @entity3 decision ever when he cautioned @entity4 for simulation earlier this season at @entity7 ’s after @entity8 wiped him out ; he now has the worst two after a shocking penalty for @entity11 against @entity12			1
@entity13 broke away down the flank and crossed the ball			0
@entity12 centre - half @entity16 was sliding to try and block the cross which he did as the ball hit him flush in the face			1
@entity0 , who was well positioned , considered the incident for a second or two and then blew his whistle and pointed to the penalty spot			1
@entity11 were awarded a controversial penalty after @entity13 's cross hit @entity16 in the face the ball hits @entity16 ( right ) in the face but referee @entity0 gave @entity11 a penalty @entity12 players surround the official after @entity11 were given a penalty in the first half @entity0 books @entity35 's @entity4 for simulation earlier this season at @entity7 's sometimes players contribute to poor refereeing decisions with dives or play - acting but this was an error all of @entity0 ’ making			1
he also awarded @entity11 a second penalty , again for handball although this time the ball did actually strike the hand of defender @entity46			1
whether it was deliberate could be debated for a long time but @entity12 manager @entity48 summed up these decisions by saying they are random and that can not be right			2
one that could not be disputed was when @entity54 goalkeeper @entity53 slid out of his penalty area to stop @entity57 ’s @entity56			2
somehow referee @entity59 and his hapless assistant @entity60 missed the offence which would surely have resulted in a red card for @entity53 had it been seen			0
referee @entity59 failed to send off @entity54 goalkeeper @entity63 for this handball outside his area @entity59 did show his red card later but he was wrong			0
@entity67 went through @entity56 with an overly physical challenge which did merit a dismissal and @entity56 reacted by confronting his opponent			0
quite how @entity67 ended up with a yellow card and @entity56 a red defies all natural justice and hopefully the @entity74 will rectify on appeal			0
no wonder @entity57 manager @entity76 feels aggrieved at refereeing decisions			0
@entity56 gives @entity67 a kick as he is on the floor and received a red card for his trouble @entity59 shows @entity56 a red card for his dig after failing to punish @entity53 earlier in the game @entity85 joined the @entity87 fun as he awarded @entity88 a free - kick just outside the penalty area when @entity91 was clearly fouled inside			1
friend later dismissed @entity93 for the softest – wrong – second yellow card which of course can not be appealed			0
add in the penalty that @entity97 should have had against @entity98 for a @entity100 handball and @entity102 ’s @entity101 escaping a clear and obvious red when bringing down @entity105 ’s @entity104 when clean through on goal			2
as you can see , it was another poor match day from the select group of referees			1
@entity93 was given his marching orders by @entity85 after picking up two second - half yellow cards the ball clearly hits the arm of @entity98 defender @entity100 at @entity97 referee @entity116 ( bottom left ) has an unobstructed view of the incident between @entity97 and @entity98 @entity104 ( right ) is tripped by @entity101 during the match between @entity102 and @entity105			0

@entity0 cautioned @entity4 for simulation this season
it was *nominated* for the worst decision in @entity3 history
@entity0 also gave a penalty against @entity12 's @entity16 at @entity11
@entity16 was penalised for handball but it hit him in the face
@entity87 was another poor match day for @entity136 referees
