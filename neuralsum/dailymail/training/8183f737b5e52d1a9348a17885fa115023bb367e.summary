by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the scene was familiar : @entity4 ’s players sat disconsolately on the floor as another tournament ended in disappointment and frustration			1
for @entity10 , though , there was a chance to apply perspective			1
@entity4 ’ s adventure in @entity14 may have finished with a 1 - 0 defeat to @entity16 in the third - place play - off but their head coach was adamant the experience was beneficial			1
‘ we need games like this , ’ said @entity10			2
‘ we can come away from here and know that we are not well short of the best nations			0
if we had not produced a performance , you might have been worried but the performance was there			2
’ matchwinner : @entity32 ( right ) scored the only goal in @entity16 @entity35 's 1 - 0 win against @entity35 's winning smille : @entity16 under 20 's celebrate their third place play - off victory at the @entity14 tournament down and out : the @entity35 players look crestfallen following their 1 - 0 defeat on sunday shooting boots : @entity45 striker @entity44 ( left ) was unable to score past the @entity16 @entity35 defence shoulder to shoulder : @entity48 ( left ) battles for the ball against @entity51 ( right ) @entity16 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity52 6.5 : @entity53 7 , @entity54 7 , @entity55 7 , @entity56 6.5 : @entity57 6.5 , @entity58 8 , goncalves 7.5 ( @entity59 80mins ) : @entity60 5 ( @entity61 25mins 7 ) , @entity32 7 , @entity62 7			1

booked : @entity73 , @entity53 , @entity67 * ratings by @entity0 in @entity14 the eccentricities of the this tournament meant this game was staged 150 miles away from @entity14 and that meant a significant change in the conditions			0
it was uncomfortably hot and each break in play saw drinks being hurriedly handed out			0
soaring temperatures , however , did not stifle the quality			0
@entity16 started impressively and came within in the width of the crossbar of taking an 18th minute lead , when @entity90 midfielder @entity57 took dead aim from 20 yards			1
but @entity4 defended stoically and finished the opening period stronger			2
with better fortune they could have even had the lead and @entity44 deserved better on 31minutes than to see @entity52 turn his shot away after good work from @entity97 and @entity98			0
@entity99 , @entity4 ’s standout player of the past 10 days , also went close with a dipping free - kick , while @entity44 worked another opening for himself but dragged his shot from 18 yards wide of the post			1
close : @entity65 ( centre ) looks dejected after a near miss at the @entity105 proud : @entity35 's coach @entity10 was happy with his side 's performance despite the defeat it was @entity4 ’s best spell of the tournament and one that would have been educational for @entity10			1
@entity16 , who have won all six of their @entity116 2015 qualifiers , could be opponents next summer in the @entity118 but they would be beatable with a full - team			1
a similar pattern followed in the second period			0
@entity16 began on the front foot – @entity123 ’s @entity65 needed to stand firm when substitute @entity61 sensed a chance – but @entity4 gave as good they got			1
@entity125 , in particular , came to life and he started causing trouble for @entity16 with his speed and directness			2
he went close to opening the deadlock twice with thumping shots after powerful runs			0
@entity65 also had a good chance , a glancing header from a @entity68 free - kick			0
up for it : @entity66 ( right ) beats @entity51 ( left ) to header during their third place play - off on the ball : @entity35 midfielder @entity125 skips the challenge @entity141 's @entity57 yet just when it looked like they were moving in for the kill , @entity4 were hit by a sucker - punch			1
@entity44 tried to clear his lines but succeeded only in smashing the ball into @entity66 and the deflection ended at the feet of @entity32 , who guided his shot past @entity150			2
‘ you could n’t make up some of the goals we have conceded while we have been here , ’ @entity10 said			2
‘ it ’s quite typical of how things have gone			0
we were well on top at that point			0
the players applied themselves and they have been a pleasure to work with			0
@entity4 kept plugging on but could n’t find a way through , meaning they matched the achievement of the class of 2002 in finishing fourth			1
it is inevitable they will return in the future .			0

@entity32 scored the only goal in @entity16 under 20 's 1 - 0 win againsy @entity4 under 20 's in the @entity170 third place play - off
@entity10 *praised* @entity4 's performance
@entity4 's fourth place finish matches their feat in 2002
