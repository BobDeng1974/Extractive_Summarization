how refreshing it was to see @entity1 properly celebrate scoring for @entity2 against former club @entity3 on monday night			1
the striker 's passion was clear to see as he bounded backwards across the @entity7 turf , letting out a roar of celebration as @entity10 and @entity11 rushed over to celebrate the moment			1
' the emotion takes over , ' he said afterwards			0
' it was difficult to keep it in			0
@entity1 had every reason to celebrate and let all that pent - up frustration out			1
a pumped - up @entity1 celebrates his winner for @entity2 at former club @entity3 the @entity2 striker celebrates with team - mates @entity10 and @entity11 after scoring at @entity3 since the age of eight , he was booted out the door in the summer by @entity23 , who claimed he was n't good enough to be a first team player at @entity3			1
so , on his first return to @entity7 , @entity1 had a major point to prove and when @entity27 under - hit a back pass to goalkeeper @entity29 , he seized his chance			1
skilfully taking the ball around the @entity32 , he passed it into an empty net before celebrating whole - heartedly but still with plenty of respect for the @entity3 fans			1
@entity1 could certainly teach these players , who took the whole not celebrating against a former club thing a little too seriously			1
@entity40 ( @entity41 vs @entity42 , january 2013 ) @entity40 was n't wanted by @entity41			2
they spent £ 21m to sign him and then kept him as a bit - part player until finally ditching him three years later having wasted the best years of his career			0
so when the winger earned @entity42 an improbable win at @entity49 during their 2013 relegation struggle , with his first league goal in nearly three years , you 'd expect him to be thrilled			0
@entity40 looked downright miserable , an island of indifference as his team - mates celebrated jubilantly around him			2
@entity40 ( third right ) looked downright miserable after scoring for @entity42 at old club @entity41 @entity57 ( @entity58 vs @entity59 , december 2012 ) likewise with @entity57 , who had great expectations when he joined @entity59 from @entity61 in 2010 but was barely given a chance by @entity63			1
indeed , @entity57 revealed when he escaped to @entity58 that he was barely on speaking terms with the @entity66 manager towards the end , having been dropped without explanation on a number of occasions during a turbulent two - and - a - half years			2
so when @entity57 gained his revenge by scoring the winner against @entity59 a few months after leaving , you 'd expect something a bit more animated than just a raised hand of apology			1
@entity57 consoles his former team - mate @entity78 after scoring against him in december 2012 @entity79 ( @entity80 vs @entity81 , september 2014 ) opening your account for a new club , especially after a £ 28m move , should be kind of a big deal			2
but @entity79 looked embarassed that his maiden goal for @entity81 had come at @entity80 , the club where he spent the 2012 - 13 season on loan from @entity41			0
still , at least he earned an appreciative round of applause from the @entity93 crowd for his sheepish raised hand ' celebration			0
' @entity79 holds his hands up after scoring for @entity81 against @entity80 , where he spent a year on loan @entity98 ( @entity99 vs @entity100 , february 2014 ) @entity98 made 47 league appearances for @entity99 over the course of his three seasons there , scoring two goals			0
hardly the stuff of @entity108 folklore			0
but the midfielder felt the need to apologise to the @entity112 crowd after scoring a lovely 20 - yard goal on his return there with @entity100 last year			0
it did earn him a round of applause from the @entity99 fans though			0
@entity98 apologised to the @entity108 after scoring for @entity100 at former club @entity99			2

@entity1 was pumped up after scoring for @entity2 at @entity7
he was dumped by @entity3 manager @entity23 in the summer
but he came back to haunt his former club with winner in @entity125
some players have n't celebrated against their old clubs , despite being *perfectly* entitled to
