@entity0 has revealed one of the most complete maps of an asteroid ever created - and it helps reveal how the huge body was formed			1
images from @entity0 's @entity6 have been used to create a series of high - resolution geological maps of the large asteroid @entity10 , revealing the variety of surface features in unprecedented detail			1
they show the towering mountains at the south pole — more than twice the height of @entity18 , and huge craters that litter the surface			1
this high - resolution geological map of @entity10 was made using data from the @entity6			1
@entity25 colors represent the oldest , most heavily cratered surface			2
purple colors in the north and light blue represent terrains modified by the @entity32 and @entity33 impacts , respectively			2
light purples and dark blue colors below the equator represent the interior of the @entity33 and @entity32 basins			0
greens and yellows represent relatively young landslides or other downhill movement and crater impact materials			0
asteroids like @entity10 are remnants of the formation of the solar system , giving scientists a peek at its history			1
asteroids could also harbor molecules that are the building blocks of life and reveal clues about the origins of life on @entity57			1
@entity10 is one of the largest asteroids in the @entity60 , with a mean diameter of 525 kilometres ( 326 mi )			1
it was discovered by @entity64 on 29 march 1807 and is named after @entity10 , the virgin goddess of home and hearth from roman mythology			0
the peak of @entity10 's tallest mountain rises up nearly 13 miles ( 22 kilometers ) above the rough surrounding terrain			1
' the geologic mapping campaign at @entity10 took about two - and - a - half years to complete , and the resulting maps enabled us to recognize a geologic timescale of @entity10 for comparison to other planets , ' said @entity78 of @entity79 , who led the study			1
the mapping was carried out using images from @entity0 's @entity6 , which orbited @entity10 between june 2011 and september 2012			1
the images let scientists create high - resolution geological maps , revealing the variety of @entity10 's surface features in unprecedented detail			1
' the geologic mapping campaign at @entity10 took about two and a half years to complete , ' says @entity78			0
' the resulting maps enabled us to construct a geologic time scale of @entity10 for comparison to other planets and moons			1
' the geologic map and timescale appear in a paper by @entity78 and others in the december 2014 issue of the journal @entity99			0
scientists discovered through these maps that impacts from several large meteorites have shaped @entity10 's history			1
asteroids like @entity10 are remnants of the formation of the solar system , giving scientists a peek at its history			1
asteroids could also harbor molecules that are the building blocks of life and reveal clues about the origins of life on @entity57			1
@entity10 's geologic timescale is determined by the sequence of large impact events , primarily by the @entity32 and @entity33 impacts in @entity10 's early history and the @entity124 impact in its late history			1
the oldest crust on @entity10 pre-dates the @entity32 impact			0
a previous mission created these images of the @entity130 ( left ) and southern ( right ) hemispheres			2
the ' @entity133 ' craters are at the top of the left image ; @entity33 and @entity32 ( green and blue ) dominate the right			0
parallel troughs are seen in both			0
the relative timescale is supplemented by model - based absolute ages from two different approaches that apply crater statistics to date the surface			2
' this mapping was crucial for getting a better understanding of @entity10 's geological history , as well as providing context for the compositional information that we received from other instruments on the spacecraft : the visible and infrared ( @entity153 ) mapping spectrometer and the gamma - ray and neutron detector ( @entity6 ) , ' said @entity156 , @entity6 's deputy principal investigator at @entity0 's @entity157 in @entity158 , @entity159			1
the @entity6 spacecraft is currently on its way to @entity162 , the largest object in the asteroid belt			1
@entity6 will arrive at @entity162 in march 2015			1
the mappers found that @entity10 's geologic time scale has been shaped by a sequence of large impact events			2
the biggest of these were the impacts that blasted the large @entity32 and @entity33 craters early in @entity10 's history , and the @entity174 late in its history			2
the towering mountain at the south pole — more than twice the height of @entity18 — is visible at the bottom of the image			1
the set of three craters known as the ' snowman ' can be seen at the top left			0
in mapping an extraterrestrial object , scientists begin by studying its surface features to develop a relative chronology of events			0
they look to see which feature interrupts or disturbs other features , thereby placing them in a relative time sequence			0
then , crater by crater , fracture by fracture , scientists build up a chronology of events			0
' figuring out an actual date in years is a step - by - step - by - step process , ' explains @entity78			2
' we work with rock samples from the moon , mostly from @entity208 missions decades ago			0
' these give actual dates for large lunar impacts			0
' the tricky part , he says , lies in creating a model that links the lunar impact time scale to the rest of the solar system			0
in the case of @entity10 , scientists have developed two different models to estimate surface ages			0
one is based on the lunar impact rate , the other on the frequency of asteroid impacts			0
thus scientists can use two approaches with crater statistics to date @entity10 's surface , but these yield two different age ranges			2
applying the models to @entity10 , @entity78 ' team concluded that the oldest surviving crust on @entity10 predates the @entity32 impact , which has an age of 2.1 billion years ( asteroid system ) or 3.7 billion years ( lunar system )			0
the @entity33 impact likely has an age of around 1 billion years ( asteroids ) or 3.5 billion years ( lunar )			2
' @entity10 's last big event , the @entity124 impact , has an age that 's still uncertain , ' says @entity78			2
' but our current best estimates suggest an age between roughly 120 and 390 million years			0
' the difference , he explains , comes from which cratering model is used .			0
