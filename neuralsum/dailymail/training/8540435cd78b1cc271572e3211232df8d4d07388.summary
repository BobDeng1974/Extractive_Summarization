by @entity0 last updated at 2:23 pm on 21st january 2012 construction workers who were working on @entity4 's @entity3 mansion before it burned down in a tragic christmas day fire are being repeatedly questioned by police in the criminal investigation of the fire ’s five deaths			1
@entity11 is a contractor who had been renovating the five - bedroom $ 1.7million house that was owned by his girlfriend @entity15			1
ms @entity4 ’s three daughters and her parents all died in the early morning blaze			1
@entity20 police have questioned all involved - including mr @entity11 and ms badger - in order to learn details about the fire			1
police told the @entity24 : ' we ’re trying to accelerate this and hopefully have something [ to release to the public ] within the next week and a half , two weeks			0
' they have concluded that it was sparked by some still - hot embers from the fireplace that mr @entity11 placed in a garbage in the mudroom after ms @entity4 ’s daughters asked for the fireplace to be cleared on christmas eve to make way for @entity39			2
loss : mrs @entity4 arrives with mr @entity11			2
they were the sole survivors of the blaze that destroyed her home at the time of the fire , the mansion was still under construction , and though it did have a fire alarm system in place , it was not installed and working at the time			1
mr @entity11 ’s company , @entity50 , has been heavily scrutinized during the investigation as well , and it was discovered that several required forms were missing			2
the house did not have a new certificate of occupancy since the @entity56 moved in , and mr @entity11 ’s contracting licenses had expired at the time of the fire			1
his contractor registration for work in the state of @entity3 expired in 2000 , and his home improvement license for the state of @entity64 expired in june 2010			0
mr @entity11 has hired @entity65 , a high - profile criminal defence attorney , to represent him in this case , but this is not his first run in with the law over his construction sites			2
house of horror : authorities are investigating if the home had activated fire alarms and contractor permits victims : @entity78 and @entity79 , seen standing , also died in the fire			0
mr @entity81 died trying to save their grandchildren , from left , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			0
another grandchild @entity88 ( right ) was not in the house @entity90 reports that he owes almost $ 100,000 in from previous legal judgements , and is also in the midst of two other lawsuits from clients - one in @entity95 and one in @entity97			0
police have officially ruled out any foul play in the investigation into the @entity56 home fire , but are now looking to see if there are any accidental criminal charges that will be filed			1
specifically , charges of criminally negligent homicide or reckless manslaughter are both possible charges in a case like this			1
because the house was torn down immediately after the fire , at the request of the local fire department which deemed it a continued safety risk , investigators are not hoping to find any evidence at the scene			0
grief : @entity118 and @entity4 embrace as the casket of one of their daughters arrives for the funeral services			0
@entity4 is comforted by @entity11 , who survived the fire that killed her children and parents instead it is more a matter of what steps were taken to ensure the safety of the home before anyone started staying there			1
fire chief @entity135 said the fire was @entity20 's deadliest since a 1987 blaze that also killed five people			1
the fire killed 7 - year - old twins @entity86 and @entity141 , 9 - year - old @entity142 and grandparents @entity78 and @entity79			0
mr @entity81 was a department store @entity39 who had worked as safety director for a @entity147 , @entity148 , company			0
mr @entity11 appeared at ms @entity4 ’s side - along with her ex-husband and his current girlfriend - at the january 5 funeral for the three girls			2
remembered : @entity153 poses with his daughters @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity85 , shortly before their deaths			0

@entity11 and his *employees* being questioned by police about possible charges of criminally negligent homicide or reckless manslaughter
police already ruled out foul play
fire alarm system was in place but not up and running at time of blaze that killed @entity11 's girlfriend 's three daughters and her parents
