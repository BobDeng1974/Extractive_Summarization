@entity8 had a brief fling with near neighbour @entity12 , 22 , and gave birth to their daughter in june last year but he refused to accept the child was his , the court was told @entity8 was killed last october only three days after she revealed to the families of @entity12 and @entity9 that she had had affairs with both men who were trying to keep it secret			1
prosecutor @entity29 said the men mounted a ' mission to kill @entity8 ' and even adopted the language of the cult @entity34 film ' @entity36 ' about @entity38 terrorists in the @entity34			0
@entity9 ( pictured ) admitted killing @entity8 in may this year and will be sentenced after the end of the trial of @entity12 , who denies murder @entity9 admitted @entity8 's murder in may this year and will be sentenced after the end of the trial of @entity12 , who denies murder			1
mr @entity44 told the jury that @entity12 was ' jointly responsible ' for @entity8 's murder			2
the court heard he failed to acknowledge @entity8 's baby and @entity9 was equally keen that his family did not know about his affair with a white girl			2
@entity8 , fed up with all the secrecy , went to tell the families of both men of her affairs with their sons			1
afterwards @entity12 and @entity9 allegedly sent a flurry of texts to one another			2
in the language used by terrorists in the ' @entity36 ' film @entity9 is said to have sent a text to @entity12 the day before @entity8 died which read : ' i 'm gon na send that kaffir b * * * * straight to hell			1
' they even talked about buying a 9.6mm ' shooter ' for Â£ 400 and @entity9 boasted about bringing his ' hit list ' out			0
in fact , said mr @entity44 , the murder weapon of choice turned out to be a knife , with @entity9 texting @entity12 : ' i need to do a mission			2
' in more language from the film @entity9 allegedly said he was going to ' make beans on toast ' , a reference to the carnage after a terrorist bomb blast			0
mr @entity44 said the comment meant the ' spilling of blood ' and when the pair talked about ' unbelieving kaffir bastards ' - non @entity86 - they were clearly referring to the ' mission ' to kill @entity8			0
mr @entity44 said @entity12 and @entity9 were angry that @entity8 had brought trouble to the door of their families			1
he said : ' she was a loose cannon and they had decided to get rid of her			0
' the teenager 's body was found in this canal in @entity98 , @entity99 the teenager went missing from her home in @entity102 , @entity98 in october last year and her body , which had been stabbed repeatedly , was found in the @entity14 and @entity104 near @entity98			0
the prosecution say it is likely @entity9 killed her when he had a ' golden opportunity ' while she was alone , after @entity12 lured her friend away			1
before the affair with @entity12 , @entity8 had fallen in love with @entity9 and they resumed the affair after @entity8 had the baby			1
mr @entity44 described @entity8 as ' embracing life with gusto and she was an attractive and popular girl '			0
she became friendly with @entity117 who also had a baby daughter with @entity12			0
they both realised @entity12 would never marry them but @entity8 was only really interested in @entity121 , mr @entity44 said			2
after @entity12 refused to acknowledge and support @entity8 's baby she became more angry as he tried to keep the lovechild a secret and she believed @entity9 was seeing another girl			1
@entity8 eventually took matters into her own hands and went to see the @entity9 and @entity12 families			1
@entity8 told @entity9 's mother she loved her son and ' wanted to have babies ' by him but the mother became angry , called her a ' dirty white bitch ' and hit @entity134 with a shoe			0
she then saw @entity12 's family and told them she had given birth to his baby but they were dismissive			0
' her actions that night brought the truth to both of their front doors and they had some explaining to do to their families , ' said mr @entity44			0
