an @entity1 teenager has put herself through 10 weeks of extreme dieting and intense exercise regimes and treatments - including eating baby food and taking daily ice baths - in the quest to achieve the perfect body			1
@entity10 film student @entity9 spent the 10 weeks undertaking the excessive fads and treatments for a participatory - style documentary she and fellow filmmaker @entity13 have submitted for a class project			1
the bizarre diets - including a week of baby food and another of just cabbage soup - left the 19 - year - old two dress sizes smaller at the end of the 10 - week period			1
going into the challenge the pair made a list of celebrity diets , exercise regimes and the most popular beauty treatments			0
she concluded the pursuit of perfection , which included the intense fitness regime @entity54 and freckle removal via laser , was not worth it			0
ms @entity13 , 23 , said @entity9 ended up losing 22kg ( 48lbs ) , and started to go a ' little bit crazy ' - especially during the third week when she was eating primarily baby food			1
' she ended up not being able to stomach the baby food and stopped eating as a result , ' she told the @entity62			1
' that was definitely one of her lowest weeks - she was really down and struggling to complete her daily requirements			1
' it was a bit insane - she started going a bit crazy and dreaming about food			2
she was n't all there sometimes and went a bit wacky			0
there were times when she did n't have to train she would just stay in bed because she had no energy			0
' a screen shot from the documentary am i perfect ? shows singer @entity79 naked on a cloud , which many people believe puts pressure on young women to have a certain body type single ladies : @entity87 's film clip shows three women in provocative and revealing clothes @entity13 , who co-wrote the script for @entity38 ? , said women like @entity92 featuring regularly in magazines made many women feel the need to look like them the baby food diet , which involves replacing two daily meals with jars of homemade pureed baby food and keeping the third meal of the day under 600 calories , gained a cult following after actresses @entity103 and @entity105 revealed they had experimented with it			1
ms @entity9 said the baby food was horrible way of living - but not as bad as the week on the master cleanse ( lemon detox ) diet			1
' it ’s a liquid only diet with a mix of maple syrup , lemon juice , cayenne pepper and water and i was combining it with ice baths and an hour ’s stairwalking , ' she told the @entity122 she also tried the macrobiotic diet , the cabbage soup diet and raw food diet - fads actresses @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128 were following respectively in the past			1
ms @entity13 said the pair consulted with a dietician and nurse regularly to ensure their were no serious health risks			0
' it actually got the point where the nurse said ( @entity137 ) needed to stop because she was losing the weight so quickly , ' she said			0
' at the beginning she did n't care but she became really focused on what people thought			0
she was counting calories all the time and trying to get the scales down			2
it 's that type of mentality that can lead to eating disorders			0
' feeling hot , hot , hot : a woman practising hot yoga , which @entity9 also did during her 10 - week experiment a group of people doing a @entity155 session , which @entity9 did as part of her 10 - week documentary @entity38 ? you 're as cold as ice : @entity9 said having a daily ice bath , such as the one pictured above , was one of the craziest things she 's ever done the idea for the documentary came about while the budding filmmakers were sitting in a cafe when they noticed an abundance of women 's magazines promoting a range of treatments and fad diets			1
' it 's an issue we are so bombarded with , there is so much pressure on women and their body image , ' ms @entity13 said			0
' every girl once in their life has tried a diet or body treatment			2
you feel the pressure particularly as a female to try these things and look like the people you see in the magazines			0
' ms @entity9 told the @entity122 : ' we ’re both passionate about the beauty pressure women put themselves under and how girls our age are trying to create the perfect female form			2
' we wanted to unpack what the myths were for ourselves and the audience and the most honest way was to go through it and experience it for ourselves			0
' she said sitting in a bath of ice to burn calories and speed up her metabolism was the craziest thing she has ever done			0
the 19 - year - old said the project also resulted in some positive change , with the teenager keen to implement group workouts and @entity155 sessions into her new lifestyle			2
the documentary is expected to be released in the coming months			2
