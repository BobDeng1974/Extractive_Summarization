@entity0 has launched one of its most addictive doodle ’s yet as it celebrates the 40th birthday of the @entity4			1
an animated version of the popular puzzle has been created by @entity0 engineers allowing anyone to solve the frustratingly - difficult game by clicking below , or visiting @entity0 's homepage			1
there are 43 quintillion versions of how the cube ’s 54 coloured squares can be arranged over the six faces - but every @entity4 is logically solvable in 20 moves or less			1
average time : @entity23 at the @entity24 2013 with a 6.54 seconds average solve time			1
one - handed solving : a time of 9.03 seconds was made by @entity23 at the @entity27 feet solving : @entity29 solved a @entity4 with his feet in 27.93 seconds at the @entity31 2012			1
robot : @entity33 3 solved a @entity4 in 3.253 seconds - beating the @entity33 2 's record of 5.27 seconds			1
the @entity4 was invented in 1974 by @entity36 sculptor and professor of architecture @entity37 , but was not released until 1980 when it became a phenomenon			0
in @entity0 ’s version , the cube is at first shown performing a simple loop			1
clicking on the animation causes the cube to become enlarged fully coloured			1
the user then rotates the rows and columns horizontally and vertically , and manipulates the cube by clicking and dragging it in different directions			1
numbers on the bottom left corner reveal how many moves have been taken			2
and the old trick of carefully steaming off all of the stickers and then re-sticking them in the right position wo n’t work here			0
on the @entity0 homepage , the user can rotate the rows and columns horizontally and vertically , and manipulate the cube by clicking and dragging it in different direction			1
numbers on the bottom left corner reveal how many moves have been taken the @entity65 for solving a @entity4 in the fastest time was smashed in march a robot			1
the @entity67 solved the cube in a speedy 3.253 seconds			1
the robot 's record - breaking time beat the previous non-human record of 5.27 seconds - set by the machine 's predecessor , the @entity33 2			2
the fastest human time to solve a cube was set in march last year by @entity18 of the @entity19 who completed the challenge in an impressive 5.55 seconds			1
amazingly , some talented fans can complete the cube with one hand - such as @entity23 who holds the single - handed completion record of 9.03 seconds			1
the official website of the @entity37 's cube recommends seven steps : 1			2
get to know your cube			2
for example , you should know that white is opposite yellow , orange is opposite red and green is opposite blue			0
the centre piece colours are always opposite each other			0
the @entity37 's website recommends you aim to create a white cross on the top face of the cube first of all			2
this will make the next phase easier			0
corner pieces will have one white side plus two other colours			0
solve the middle layer , so the bottom two layers of your cube match in colour			2
try and get a yellow cross on the top face of your cube			2
next , you should try and get all the yellow on the top face			0
position the yellow corners correctly			0
twist the top face , which should be yellow , until at least two of the corners are in the right location			0
finally , correctly place the centre pieces			0
another top solver @entity29 can complete the toy with his feet in just 27.93 seconds last month , @entity124 spoke to @entity37 , inventor of the @entity4 , about its legacy			2
‘ @entity126 is full of contradictions , ’ @entity37 said			0
‘ humans like contradictions , because that makes life interesting and enjoyable			0
@entity126 is very simple and very complex at the same time			0
’ @entity37 added that when it first came out , it was much tougher to solve without access to @entity0 or other websites			1
‘ nowadays it 's different , ’ he said			0
‘ you can learn it ; you can find lots of things on the internet			0
the combined power of the mind is much stronger than individual ones			0
’ the fastest human to ever complete a cube - which was invented in 1974 by @entity36 sculptor @entity37 , is @entity18 of the @entity19 in march 2013 with a time of 5.55 seconds			1
