by @entity0 published : 16:14 est , 14 july 2013 updated : 01:57 est , 15 july 2013 staff at a children ’s play centre called police when a father defied their order not to sing @entity7 to his young daughter during a party			1
@entity10 was told his group was not allowed to sing the song as they had not paid for a ‘ birthday package ’			1
despite spending £ 300 on food , drinks and entry fees for his daughter @entity20 ’s eighth birthday , a staff member tried to intervene as the group lit candles on a cake and began to sing			1
outraged : @entity10 ( pictured with his daughter @entity20 ) was in shock and disbelief when he was told to blow out the candles on his 8 - year - old 's birthday cake and stop singing happy birthday because he had n't booked with @entity32 's sold - out birthday package when mr @entity10 , 47 , stood in front of the receptionist to stop her from interrupting and ‘ upsetting ’ the party of 18 children she contacted police			1
officers were given @entity41 footage of the incident at the @entity44 children ’s centre but have taken no action against mr @entity10			1
the heating engineer , who lives with his wife @entity47 , 49 , and their six children in @entity50 , @entity51 , described the centre ’s actions as ‘ utter madness ’			0
@entity44 said it was ‘ against company policy ’ for people to sing @entity7 on the premises without having specifically booked a party			0
mrs @entity59 had contacted @entity44 to enquire about booking a birthday party for 20 children and six adults but was told there was no availability			0
the family decided to visit the centre in @entity67 anyway			0
after arriving they noticed two of the ‘ party booths ’ were not being used , and a female staff member said they could use one			0
but the woman later told the group she was ‘ in fairly big trouble ’ for letting them use the room when they had not booked it and said they should not ‘ produce a cake or sing @entity7 ’			0
mr @entity10 refused , saying he was not going to let the centre ‘ put a downer ’ on his youngest child ’s party			1
the family brought their own cake in accordance with @entity44 ’s policy that ‘ you bring the cake , we do the rest ’ , but did not eat it on the premises			2
by the book : staff at @entity44 children 's centre in @entity67 confronted the party of 18 children			2
they called the police when they say mr @entity10 displayed an ' aggressive attitude ' ‘ when the cake came out you could sense a bit of nervous tension among the staff , and one particular lady came storming down and told us that we could not sing and to put the cake away , ’ mr @entity10 said			1
he said he stood in front of her to shield the children and told her to go away			2
he added that he was left in ‘ shock and disbelief ’ by the centre ’s actions and said the other six parents in the group were ‘ fuming ’			0
@entity44 ’s manager @entity120 said it is their policy that ‘ you do n’t celebrate a birthday party on our premises unless it is the package you obtain ’			0
he added : ‘ there were four other groups and we did not want them to see that people can just come in and celebrate a birthday without respecting our policy			0
’ mr @entity120 claimed mr @entity10 ’s group was offered a birthday package but chose not to take it			1
however , he admitted they spent more on entry fees and food than if they had used the birthday service , which costs between £ 7.50 and £ 15 per child			0
he claimed that a staff member contacted police because mr @entity10 had displayed an ‘ aggressive attitude ’ , pointed his finger at her face and took photographs of her			1
mr @entity10 denies he was aggressive and said he took pictures of the woman who tried to stop the group from singing @entity7 so he could identify her for a subsequent complaint			2
a police spokesman confirmed that officers had spoken to mr @entity10 at @entity44 , but said no formal action was taken .			2

@entity10 , 47 spent more than £ 300 for daughter @entity20 's eighth birthday at @entity155
@entity157 tried to book ' birthday package ' where staff sing along and present the cake it was n't available
was told to put birthday cake away despite centre 's ' you bring the cake , we do the rest ' policy
staff called the police when mr @entity10 stood in front of *waitress* to stop her ' upsetting ' the children
