by @entity0 @entity1 : 21:10 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 21:10 est , 20 december 2013 record numbers of parents are ending up with criminal records for letting their children skip lessons , new figures show			1
truancy convictions have topped 10,000 for the first time amid a growing crackdown on youngsters missing class			0
the @entity15 figures come as the @entity16 has increasingly turned the spotlight on truancy and the problem families who continue to condone it			1
spotlight : figures released under the @entity23 show that in 2012 , 12,909 parents in @entity25 and @entity26 were taken to court for failing to ensure their children go to school ( file picture ) figures released under the @entity23 show that in 2012 , 12,909 parents in @entity25 and @entity26 were taken to court for failing to ensure their children go to school			1
of these , 10,185 were found guilty and sentenced - a 3.5 per cent rise on 2011 ’s figures of 9,836			1
two - thirds - 6,871 were fined ; 516 undertook community service and 20 were jailed			2
the number of convictions has risen more than fivefold from 2001 when only 2,243 were prosecuted and 1,845 found guilty and sentenced			0
between 2001 and 2012 , 71,552 parents have been convicted and 173 jailed			1
the @entity15 will release figures for 2013 next may			1
among the parents recently sanctioned is mother - of - six @entity41 , 35 , from @entity42 , who was jailed after her two teenage daughters attended fewer than a third of their school days			1
she was sent to prison for 16 weeks in june after pleading guilty to two offences of failing to secure the attendance of the girls aged 16 and 14			1
@entity42 magistrates ’ court heard that the girls had made just 59 and 56 attendances respectively out of 182			1
@entity54 , defending , told the court that ms @entity41 had withdrawn pocket money , mobile phones , laptops and even refused to buy @entity58 presents in a bid to make them go to lessons			2
magistrates gained new powers to deal with the parents of truanting children in 2000 , when the maximum fine they could impose was more than doubled from £ 1,000 to £ 2,500			1
since september 2012 , head teachers have been able to impose a £ 60 spot fine on parents , rising to £ 120 if it goes unpaid			2
this compares to just £ 50 under the previous government			0
the time limit for paying has also slashed cut from 28 to 21 days for a £ 60 fine and 42 to 28 days for a £ 120 charge			0
excuses : the results also suggested that parents might be attempting to get around the new rules by claiming sickness as the reason for absences ( file picture ) meanwhile legislation came into force in @entity25 this september which scrapped a system that allowed head teachers to grant ‘ authorised absences ’ to pupils to go on holiday during term time			2
now they can only approve days off under ‘ exceptional circumstances ’			0
a recent survey found that a quarter of head teachers have fined parents for flouting the new rules			2
the survey of more than 800 primary school head teachers and deputies in @entity25 - conducted by @entity102 consultancy service - also suggested that parents might be attempting to get around the new rules by claiming sickness as the reason for absences			1
latest figures show that ‘ unauthorised absences ’ between september 2012 and march this year increased from 0.9 per cent to one per cent			2
this meant that around 63,000 youngsters were missing lessons without permission on a typical day			0
professor @entity113 , director of the @entity114 at @entity115 , said : ‘ it ’s clear from the figures there ’s been a crackdown			2
‘ it would be good to have evidence of how successful this approach is			0
i suspect that many of the families are dysfunctional and a criminal conviction is n’t necessarily going to be that effective in giving the young person the start in life that we would want			0
‘ clearly , to get as much out of life as you can , you need the best possible education			0
it ’s important you should be in schools			0
but i wonder if it would be more effective making sure that within schools there ’s provision that enhances the lives of those who are deciding to truant			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity143 said : ‘ poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging effect , and children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more likely to achieve five or more good gcses than those who are regularly absent			1
‘ that is why we have given schools more power to tackle poor attendance and allowed them to intervene much earlier			0
we have also increased the amount parents can be fined for unauthorised absences and cut the amount of time they have to pay			0

the @entity15 figures come as @entity16 *focuses* on the issue
more than 12,000 parents were taken to court after children missed school
one mother from @entity42 was jailed for 16 weeks
