by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:08 est , 30 october 2013 updated : 21:46 est , 30 october 2013 a second woman who had an extra-marital affair with the @entity5 doctor on trial for murdering his wife has testified saying that he talked about ways to kill someone			2
@entity11 took the stand on wednesday in the ongoing murder trial against @entity14 and she said that she had a six month affair with the married father			1
ms @entity11 's relationship with @entity14 came months before his relationship with @entity19 , the mistress that he was seeing at the time of his wife @entity22 's death			1
' pillow talk ' : @entity14 's former mistress @entity11 testified that he told her he knew how to give someone certain drugs and they would die and it would make it look like a natural heart attack cold : @entity14 , a doctor , kept his emotions on lockdown during testimony on wednesday while his daughters frequently cried on the stand as they accused him of killing their mother ms @entity11 's testimony is particularly relevant because she says that the doctor told her that he knew a way to kill someone and make it look like a natural heart attack			1
she told the @entity44 court that during ' pillow talk ' , @entity14 told her : ' there 's something you can give someone that 's natural that 's a heart attack that 's not detectable after they have a heart attack			1
' that goes directly in line with the prosecution 's argument as they allege that @entity14 forced his wife to have a face lift and then he plied her with unnecessary drugs effectively forcing a heart attack			1
the defense tried to discredit ms @entity11 as a witness by bringing up her former multiple personality diagnosis			0
she is the second former mistress of @entity14 who has been brought in front of the court , as @entity67 spent two days on the stand earlier in the week			1
today she was just mentioned by three of @entity14 's eight children who were all questioned			2
all three of the daughters who testified today - @entity71 , 19 , @entity72 , 32 , and @entity73 who now uses her mother 's maiden name rather than @entity14 - believe that their father killed their mother in order to pursue his relationship with @entity67			1

she told the court that he started to say that the nanny 's name was @entity95 and she cut him off			2
' you mean @entity97 ? i know that woman and i know that mom was worried about you having an affair with her and you are not to bring her into this home , ' @entity73 recalled telling her father			0
he was screaming at me , " how dare you , how dare you accuse me ? " ' the court had never been told that @entity22 had suspicions about her husband cheating before , but @entity73 said that her mother had paid a service to track a phone number that her husband had been calling			0
that number was registered to @entity110			0
the two other daughters who testified on wednesday said that @entity67 was brought to their @entity113 home just days after their mother , @entity22 , died in 2007			1

heartbroken : @entity123 , one of the daughters of a doctor accused of killing his wife in 2007 , testified today that she was n't worried her father was having an affair as the woman was nothing like her mother emotional : @entity123 is one of four sisters who have testified in the ongoing murder trial ' she made spaghetti once , and that was the only time she cooked , ' said @entity71 , a @entity134 student who was adopted by the family from the @entity136			1
' she did n't do anything			0
' she added that @entity67 would go into the father 's room late at night and take vacations together - but would leave the house separately to avoid raising suspicions			2
@entity123 , another of the couple 's daughters , sobbed as she testified on wednesday and told juror that she had volunteered to move home and help with her sisters - but her father said no. ' he said that everybody needs to get back to their lives , ' @entity72 , 32 , said			1
' that he was going to hire a nanny â€¦ that things needed to get back to normal			0
' @entity72 was asked to help interview candidates for the job but only @entity67 turned up and her father claimed that all others had canceled , the @entity154 reported			2
she also said she told her sister , @entity73 , not to worry about the woman after she said she feared she was having an affair with their father			0
testimony : @entity164 , 19 , said that her father 's mistress was hired as a nanny but did little to help in court : @entity14 , pictured wednesday , is accused of killing his wife so he could continue the affair ' i told her not to worry , ' @entity123 said			1
' i was convinced that [ @entity67 ] was n't somebody to worry about , that my dad might be involved with ... because she was nothing like my mom			0
' @entity72 is the biological mother of 12 - year - old @entity176 , who found @entity22 's body on the day she died			2
the @entity115 adopted @entity178 , who is expected to testify at a later date			0
another of the couple 's older daughters , @entity73 , testified wednesday that @entity67 would come and go throughout the day , and seemed more focused on the doctor than the children			2
