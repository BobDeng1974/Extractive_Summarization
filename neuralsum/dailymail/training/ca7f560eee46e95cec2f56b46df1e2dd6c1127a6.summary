by @entity0 published : 12:16 est , 28 january 2014 updated : 12:48 est , 28 january 2014 a toddler has defied the odds by recovering from an incredibly rare condition that left her body covered in bruises			1
@entity7 was just four weeks old when she was diagnosed with a rare condition that affects just one in 100,000 children			1
she has @entity10 with @entity12 syndrome , which leaves her suffering from tumours that dramatically deplete her blood platelet levels			1
@entity7 ( pictured with her parents , @entity17 and @entity18 ) has a rare and life - threatening condition that left her covered in huge bruises it means her blood can not clot so a simple cut or bruise could be life - threatening			1
the 19 - month - old has to go to hospital every day and takes as many as ten different medications to control her condition			1
but specialists from @entity30 , in @entity29 , believe they may have successfully treated the condition , and hope she can make a full recovery			2
her mother , @entity35 , first suspected something was wrong when @entity7 was just one month old and she developed severe bruising on her stomach			1
she was rushed to @entity39 where doctors carried out a blood test and found that @entity7 ’s platelet count had dropped to a dangerously low level			1
mother - of - four mrs @entity7 , 35 , from @entity29 , said : ‘ @entity7 was born healthy and had a normal delivery - but when she was four weeks old i spotted a huge bruise on her belly while i was changing her nappy			1
@entity7 had a tumour which depleted her platelet levels meaning her blood could n't clot and she was at risk of a life - threatening bleed			1
she was diagnosed after developing a bruise on her stomach at one month old @entity7 ( pictured in hospital ) had to have surgery to remove the tumour but after the operation she started to bleed uncontrollably and ended up fighting for her life ‘ when you see something like that on your baby you think either someone has hurt her or that it is meningitis - so we rushed her straight to hospital			1
‘ the doctor ’s thought that we had hurt @entity7 at first , they did n’t know what was wrong with her			2
it was n’t until they did a blood test that they noticed her platelets were very low			0
kaposiform hemangioendothelioma is a rare benign tumour of the blood vessels			2
it is not cancerous and does not spread around the body			0
it is often accompanied by a potentially serious condition called @entity12 syndrome			0
this occurs when the tumour traps and destroys platelets in the child 's body			0
this means the child 's platelet levels are depleted so their blood can not clot properly			1
as a result , they are at risk of dangerous bleeding			1
source : @entity100 ‘ if i had n’t got her straight to hospital , or had ignored the bruising , she could have died that day			0
’ @entity7 had an operation to remove a large tumour from her torso when she was four months old , but had to be rushed into hospital again after the wound began to bleed uncontrollably			1
her parents , @entity17 and her husband @entity18 , spent their first wedding anniversary at their daughter ’s bedside as she fought for her life in hospital			0
mrs @entity7 said : ‘ she was bleeding really heavily from the wound so we rushed her straight to hospital			1
‘ they gave her a blood transfusion and pumped platelets into her before she was hurried into the operating theatre			0
‘ we really thought we were going to lose her that day , but she has really been a little fighter			0
’ the condition , which only affects children , means that @entity7 ’s platelet levels drop from a normal level of between 150 to 400 to as low as 12			1
the toddler has already undergone countless operations and spent a lot of time in hospital , and is still required to visit the hospital for monitoring			0
@entity7 ( pictured with her parents , @entity17 and @entity18 , and her siblings @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 ) is now starting to recover and her doctors hope she will grow out of the condition as she gets older @entity7 has to take up to ten medicines a day ( pictured ) as well as going to hospital for regular check ups but her parents are hopeful that she will continue to show signs of recovery , and eventually recover fully from the condition			1
@entity30 ’s consultant paediatric oncologist professor @entity145 said : ‘ it is a very rare condition that i believe affects only one in 100,000 people			0
‘ sufferers get these vast vascular anomalies that affect their platelets in blood vessels and can lead to bleeding disorders , which are often life - threatening			2
@entity7 's mother , @entity17 , said : ' when @entity7 was first diagnosed we felt so alone			2
all we wanted was to find another mum or dad to speak to , someone who understood how we felt ' ‘ we currently do not know what causes the bleeding , but it can be fatal			0
we have tried a number of treatments with @entity7 and we believe her last - a neurotherapy known as sirolimus - has been successful and she will begin to develop at a normal rate for a child her age			2
‘ the syndrome can cause severe problems for people depending where it is located in the body - in this case it is in @entity7 ’s chest and abdominal area			0
we hope the condition will burn itself out and will provide support to prevent the condition deteriorating			2
‘ i know the impact has been huge on @entity7 ’s family , but we are working to help her make a full recovery			0
’ mr and mrs @entity7 are currently raising money for cancer charity @entity187 and want to raise awareness of the rare condition to help other families in a similar position			2
they said : ‘ when @entity7 was first diagnosed we felt so alone			2
all we wanted was to find another mum or dad to speak to , someone who understood how we felt			0
‘ the only people we had to speak to were doctors and nurses and we went through a really lonely time			0
‘ we had a lot of support from our friends and family - but @entity187 were brilliant and really helped us through a tough time			0
‘ that ’s why we think it is so important to raise money for them and to raise awareness of the condition			0

@entity7 had a tumour in her abdomen that depleted her platelet levels so her blood could n't clot and she was at risk of dangerous bleeding
was diagnosed after developing a bruise on her stomach at one month old
when she was four months old she had surgery to remove the tumour
she started to bleed uncontrollably and was left fighting for her life
doctors hope the condition is now under control and that it will ' burn itself out ' as she gets older
