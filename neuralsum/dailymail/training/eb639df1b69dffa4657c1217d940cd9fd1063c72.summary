by @entity0 since the @entity2 was retired in july 2011 , the @entity1 has relied on @entity3 to get its astronauts into orbit			1
but through their @entity7 , @entity6 has been busy funding the development of a new breed of spacecraft			1
and now @entity11 has unveiled its capsule that will begin transporting astronauts into space by 2017			1
@entity11 has unveiled a mockup of the interior of their new crew @entity17 ( @entity20 - 100 ) vehicle that will be used to astronauts into space in the coming years			0
the capsule is funded by @entity6 as part of their programme to develop private spacecraft @entity11 ’s vision for the future of human spaceflight is the @entity31 ( @entity32 )			1
they unveiled the new commercial interior of its @entity32 next - generation manned space capsule , showing how people other than @entity6 astronauts may one day travel to space			1
this is the first time they have made the design of the interior public			1
@entity11 and partner @entity44 highlighted the future commercial interior of the capsule it is developing for @entity6 , while @entity44 showcased a full - scale model of its @entity50 inflatable space habitat that astronauts could one day live in			1
' we are moving into a truly commercial space market and we have to consider our potential customers - beyond @entity6 - and what they need in a future commercial spacecraft interior , ' said @entity57 , former @entity58 commander and current @entity11 director of crew and mission operations for the @entity7			1
engineers from across @entity11 leveraged the company 's decades of experience in commercial and government aerospace to design the capsule 's interior			2
the capsule , interior view of a prototype pictured , will be able to seat a crew of seven and it will also be able to take cargo into orbit			2
it is in direct competition with @entity79 's manned dragon capsule and @entity82 's @entity81 space plane , all of which are vying to be the first private company to take humans into space ' @entity11 's teams have been designing award - winning and innovative interiors for our airplanes since the dawn of commercial aviation , ' said @entity92 , regional director of sales and @entity93 for @entity94			0
' designing the next - generation interior for commercial space is a natural progression			0
a familiar daytime blue sky scene helps passengers maintain their connection with @entity101			0
' the @entity32 , developed as part of @entity6 's @entity104 initiative , is designed to transport crew and cargo to low - earth - orbit			1
one thing of note is that the capsule seems very clean and tidy			0
spacecraft are generally an array of wires and buttons , but it seems @entity11 are going for a ‘ cleaner ’ approach			2
it also has a surprisingly large number of windows , something not normally favoured by engineers but preferred by astronauts			0
the seats are lightweight and plastic to keep the weight of the capsule down			0
the @entity125 will at first be used to take astronauts to the @entity127 , pictured			0
however , @entity11 also envisages a future where it is used to transport astronauts to private spacecraft such as @entity44 's inflatable habitats , which will be launched in the future the @entity32 is designed to carry a crew of seven people into orbit to the @entity127 or whatever over space station comes to be built in future			1
however , @entity11 also has plans to make the spacecraft available for private missions , highlighted by their partnership with @entity44			2
@entity44 is in the process of developing a series of inflatable space habitats , known as the @entity50 , with a view to launching them into orbit in the coming years			2
they have already tested inflatable habitat technology with their @entity151 and 2 missions in 2006 and 2007			0
in 2017 they will attach an inflatable module to the @entity127 to further test the technology , before launching a standalone habitat in the future			2
three companies are currently receiving funding from @entity6 to develop manned vehicles as part of the @entity7			1
the first is @entity79 , the company that seemingly came from nowhere a decade ago and has now flown the unmanned @entity161 spacecraft to the @entity127 three times on its successful falcon 9 series of rockets			2
they are in the process of developing a manned version of the @entity161 ( mockup pictured above ) that can take a crew of seven into orbit , with rumours suggesting it may be unveiled this month with a view to launching its first crew as early as next year			0
@entity11 , meanwhile , with a rich heritage in space exploration is building the seven - seater cst - 100 capsule			0
and finally @entity82 are constructing what some regard as the true successor to the @entity2			0
known as the @entity81 ( test vehicle pictured below ) , this ‘ mini-shuttle ’ of sorts will launch upright on top of a rocket , taking a crew of seven into orbit before gliding back to @entity101 at the end of its mission			0
@entity81 with testing already underway , @entity81 is expected to undertake its first mission into space for the first time in 2017 on an @entity195 rocket .			1

the aerospace giant has revealed a concept of its new spacecraft
the @entity31 ( @entity32 ) is designed to fly into orbit
it will take crews of seven people to the iss and other *destinations*
one of three vehicles being funded by @entity6 to *replace* the @entity209
it is expected to begin flights in 2017 at a *similar* time to its rivals
