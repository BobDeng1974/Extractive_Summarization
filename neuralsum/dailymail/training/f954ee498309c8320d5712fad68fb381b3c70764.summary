by @entity0 published : 19:38 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 19:38 est , 8 december 2012 a woman was forced to have a mastectomy after a private clinic took nearly a year to pass on the results of a crucial scan that revealed she was suffering from breast cancer			1
the x-ray showed @entity9 had a potentially cancerous tumour in her left breast but by the time she received the results from @entity14 11 months later , it had grown into an aggressive 2in lump			1
the grandmother , 64 , then endured months of gruelling chemotherapy and surgery which experts say could have been prevented			1
however , she is unable to bring a legal claim against @entity14 for the appalling blunder after the chain went into administration last year			1
ordeal : victim @entity9 had an x-ray on a potentially cancerous tumour in her left breast but by the time she received the results from @entity14 11 months later , it had grown into an aggressive 2in lump the firm , subsequently bought by another organisation , has also failed to apologise for the error			1
social worker mrs @entity9 , from @entity34 , said : ‘ i was flabbergasted to receive an envelope in the post after 11 months			1
it said i needed a follow - up and originally i thought , “ well , a follow - up is fine			0
” ‘ it was n’t until i took it to my gp , who said the time - lapse was appalling , that i realised something was wrong			0
within ten days i had seen a consultant and had a tissue biopsy			0
‘ the tumour was too large by then to save my breast			2
i felt horribly let down			0
doctors say the mastectomy would n’t have been necessary if someone had seen the x-ray results a year earlier			0
i ca n’t get anyone to admit they did anything wrong			0
’ 11 months too late : mrs @entity9 was forced to have a mastectomy after a private clinic took too long to pass on the results of a crucial scan ( stock picture ) that revealed she was suffering from breast cancer the mother of four had regular health assessments with @entity14 because her employers , @entity64 in @entity65 , had a contract with the company			1
in may 2009 , she went for an annual check - up at its site in @entity70 and was referred to a respected @entity72 clinic for a routine mammogram because of her age			0
it is understood the clinic sent the results on the same day by courier to @entity14 ’s main office , with a recommendation that a further investigation be carried out immediately			2
no action taken : after a routine mammogram , the results were sent to @entity14 's main office , with a recommendation for immediate investigation however , no action was taken			2
mrs @entity9 contacted @entity14 in july 2009 to ask about the results but nothing was passed on , which she assumed was a good sign			1
it was only after @entity14 rang her in april 2010 to make an appointment for another health check that the x-ray was posted to her home with a recommendation that it be ‘ followed up ’			2
@entity14 , which went into administration in 2011 , was later taken over by @entity94 , but it still operates clinics under the @entity14 name			2
@entity14 ’s insurers , which would have been responsible for making a payout , deemed @entity100 ’s policy invalid as one doctor working at the group was found not to have personal liability insurance			0
mrs @entity9 ’s solicitor @entity104 , from @entity105 , said : ‘ we ’re told the company ’s insurance policy is invalidated by what is another administrative failing on the part of @entity14			1
they were obliged to ensure all of their doctors were insured but one was n’t			0
’ @entity115 , which owns @entity94 , said : ‘ as we did not own the company at the time it would be inappropriate to make any comment			0

@entity9 , 64 , had a potentially cancerous tumour in her breast but when she received the results 11 months late , it had grown into an aggressive 2in lump
she endured months of chemotherapy and surgery which experts say could have been prevented
she is unable to make a legal claim against @entity14 after the chain went into administration last year
