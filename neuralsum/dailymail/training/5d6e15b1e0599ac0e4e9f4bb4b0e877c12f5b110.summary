after a year roaming the surface of @entity3 , @entity1 has failed to find any evidence that its atmosphere is supporting life , it was revealed today			1
the curiosity rover currently scanning the @entity3 has not detected any methane , a gas that is produced by living things			1
since landing in @entity12 last year , every morning and evening the car - size probe has analysed @entity3 ' air and scanned it with a tiny laser in search of the greenhouse gas			1
@entity1 had high hopes that the rover would inhale methane after orbiting spacecraft and @entity32 - based telescopes detected plumes of the gas several years ago			1
on @entity32 , most of the gas is a by - product of life , spewed when animals digest or plants decay			0
' if you had microbial life somewhere on @entity3 that was really healthy and cranking away , you might see some of the signatures of that in the atmosphere , ' said mission scientist @entity44 of @entity1 's @entity45			1
during @entity47 's first eight months on the red planet , it probed the air during the day and at night as the season changed from spring to summer			0
journey : curiosity has traveled around one mile in the past year			2
this map shows where the rover has been between landing at ' @entity57 ' on august 6 last year and august 1 ' every time we looked , we never saw it , ' said @entity61 , of @entity1 's @entity62 , who led the research published online in the journal @entity65			1
@entity61 said while the result was ' disappointing in many ways , ' the hunt for the elusive gas continues			0
while methane is linked to living things , it can also be made by non-biological processes			0
@entity3 today is a hostile place - extremely dry and constantly bombarded by radiation			2
billions of years ago , the planet boasted a thicker atmosphere and possible lakes			0
scientists generally agree that nothing can exist on the @entity3 surface at present since it 's too toxic			1
if there are living things on @entity3 , scientists theorize they 're likely underground			2
just because @entity47 did n't detect methane near its landing site does n't mean the gas is not present elsewhere on the planet , said @entity88 , chief executive of the @entity89 , a space advocacy group			0
at work : curiosity spends its time analysing all elements of @entity3 using a series of lasers and probes - but some results have been disappointing fo scientists on @entity32 ' suppose you 're an alien coming to @entity32 and you landed in the @entity102 area , would you feel as if you 've explored the @entity32 ? ' he said			2
several years ago , scientists became excited at the prospect of methane - producing microbes after @entity105 of @entity1 's @entity45 noticed a mysterious belch of methane from three regions in @entity3 ' western hemisphere			1
@entity105 , who had no role in the latest study , said he stood by his observations			0
earlier this month , @entity47 reached its first rest stop in its long trek toward @entity115 , a mountain rising from @entity12 near the equator			0
the rover will take monthly readings of the @entity3 atmosphere during the road trip , expected to last almost a year			1
@entity47 previously found evidence of an ancient environment that could have once been suitable for microscopic life			0
while the latest finding diminishes hope for present - day life , scientists still hope to uncover signs of ancient life by looking for organic compounds at the base of @entity115 .			0

curiosity rover has found no sign of methane , which is produced by life
robot has spent a year on @entity3 scanning its surface and atmosphere
