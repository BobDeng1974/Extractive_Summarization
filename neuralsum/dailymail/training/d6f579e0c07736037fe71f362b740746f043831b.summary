the bizarre design has been proposed by @entity7 and @entity9 - based studio @entity8 , which has previously created umbrella - fronted buildings and grass - covered telecoms towers			1
the ‘ @entity14 ’ design could be created using inflatables made of white antibacterial nylon that are placed in front of the exterior of an ordinary office in central @entity7			1
it may look like a giant misshapen bouncy castle , but this building will in fact be an ultra-clean , shape - shifting office @entity25 said that this ‘ renovation of a common , old and unattractive building ’ , will not only improve the @entity7 skyline but also help keeps germs out of the office			1
the bubble shapes on the outside of the building have been designed to move with the wind and interact with people inside the building			2

the ‘ @entity14 ’ has been proposed for central @entity7 by @entity8
inflatable antibacterial nylon would cover the exterior of an ordinary office
air space between the fabric and the window will act as efficient insulation
structure would inflate and deflate as people come in and out of building
