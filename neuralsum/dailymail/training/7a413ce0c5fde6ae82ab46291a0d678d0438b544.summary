mr @entity0 told @entity17 mr @entity4 : ‘ you are a chateau bottled nuclear powered * * * *			1

but this is not the way to go about it			0
’ @entity1 whip @entity34 tried to stop the row last tuesday afternoon , saying : ‘ this is not doing any good for anyone			0
’ but mr @entity0 refused to be silenced and told mr @entity4 : ‘ this is nothing more than a grotesque f * * * ing vanity project to promote your absurd f * * * ing campaign to become party leader			1
you are n’t up to it , man ! ’ the clash between @entity50 mr @entity0 and mr @entity4 , brought up by a single mother on a council estate in @entity53 , shocked onlookers			1
‘ you could hear the shouting and swearing from one end of the tea room to the other , ’ said one			0

i feel very angry about what @entity4 has done			2
he has made no secret of the fact that he is running a putative leadership campaign against the pm			0
hardly a single mp supports him			0
‘ the @entity1 was totally united at its party conference a few weeks ago			0
but within days @entity4 tried to blow that unity sky - high with his nonsense referendum idea			2
what really worries me is all the hard - working conservative mps who could lose their seats as a result of his ludicrous and deeply irresponsible antics			0
’ one @entity1 mp who witnessed the exchange said : ‘ @entity96 ’s barrack room language was over the top but the vast majority of us agree with him			0
@entity4 is being totally reckless and is in danger of becoming a pariah among his colleagues			2
it is totally impractical to have a referendum next year			0

mr @entity0 called @entity9 mp @entity4 ' a f * * * ing disgrace to your party , your fellow mps , your prime minister and your country '

last night mr @entity0 refused to apologise saying ' i have no regrets ' while mr @entity4 said he would not be ' bullied ' on the matter
