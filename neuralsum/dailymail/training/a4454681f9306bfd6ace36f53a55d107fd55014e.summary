@entity8 , 51 , visited grieving @entity9 at her home in @entity11 , @entity12 , when her son @entity13 , 39 , died suddenly			1
but while mrs @entity9 was stood with a priest next to her son 's coffin , @entity8 helped herself to the family 's gold jewellery			1
@entity9 , 51 , with her son @entity19 ( left ) , who died suddenly and @entity8 , who stole jewellery worth more than £ 2,000 from the family home she was today jailed for 140 days having admitting theft			1
mrs @entity9 said : ' she is scum - she stole from me when my son was lying in a coffin in the other room '			1
@entity8 , who had been friends with mrs @entity9 for more than 30 years , called on her at home to offer condolences following the shock death of her son , better known as @entity33			1
once mrs @entity9 was distracted with the priest , making arrangements for @entity33 's funeral , @entity8 bundled six gold rings and a bracelet worth £ 2,000 into a pillowcase and left with them			1
she later sold the jewellery to a market trader for under £ 1,000			0
mrs @entity9 said : ' after losing contact for a year , @entity8 got in touch when she heard about @entity33			1
she did everything for me - she took me to register his death , and took me to the chapel of rest , and even offered to pay for the order of service			0
speaking of @entity8 , mrs @entity9 said : ' she is scum - she stole from me when my son was lying in a coffin in the other room ' @entity19 , who was better known as @entity33 , died suddenly at the age of 39 ' we realised on the morning of @entity33 's funeral the jewellery that things were missing			1
my son was lying in his coffin in the other room			0
' she excused herself when the priest came to the house , and then left holding a pillow case with bedding from the spare room			0
' what sort of person would do that ? ' the family , who discovered the theft on the day of @entity33 's funeral , said the experience , and the wait for the court appearance , meant that they had yet to be able to properly grieve for @entity33			0
left distraught : @entity9 , pictured with her partner @entity78 , was abused in court @entity12 @entity80 heard how @entity8 admitted taking the jewellery and selling it , but had maintained she found the gold in a clear plastic bag , in a neighbour 's garden when she had left the house			1
@entity87 , prosecuting , said the claim : ' stretches the imagination somewhat			0
' the court was also read a statement from a member of staff at the gold buyers , who said that when @entity8 had visited them , she ' seemed very nervous , and was looking around and wiping her face and her forehead '			2
as district judge @entity99 began to sentence @entity8 , to 140 days imprisonment , a family member of @entity8 shouted expletives directed at @entity103			2
in a statement , mrs @entity9 and partner @entity78 , said : ' we are pleased with the verdict			2
if she had not stolen our jewellery she would not be in this position			0
' she took advantage of us at our lowest ebb , and tainted the memory of our son , and caused us distress and pain			0
' to be screamed at and threatened by a member of her family in court was unbelievable			0
' we have done nothing - we are the victims , but we have the full support of police if there are further reprisals , and have had a lot of support from the community			0
' mrs @entity9 said : ' it had a terrible impact , i lost my son , and found out on the day of the funeral that someone had gone through my bedroom and stolen from us			2
' i feel i have not been able to grieve for my son properly , and it was by a friend whom i thought was a very good friend			0
' describing some of @entity8 's evidence as ' risible ' and ' unbelievable ' , district judge @entity99 said : ' this was a particularly heartless and spiteful act			2
