the season 13 premier of @entity1 had a plotline that millions of fans have been waiting years for -- the @entity4 finally met @entity6 's other venerable cartoon family , @entity7			1
the hour - long episode saw the @entity4 of @entity1 stranded in @entity9 , where their friendly rivalry was placed at center stage and won @entity1 its biggest premier ratings in four years			1
but did the long - awaited television event satisfy fans ? in the words of @entity15 : ' yay ... a crossover always brings out the best in each show			2
it never smacks of desperation , the priorities are always creative and not driven by marketing			0
that disappointing ratings grab is certain to leave more fans with a bitter taste in their mouths than the @entity1 episode , which gave @entity26 's series its biggest ratings in four years , reports @entity38			1
it also handlily beat out all other shows of the night , even after a internet firestorm that raged last week after news leaked that the episode would contain a tasteless rape joke			1
the joke punctuates a scene in which the incorrigible @entity47 is instructing @entity48 in the art of the prank phone call			2
@entity47 dials the owner of @entity52 and asks whether there is anyone there with the last name @entity57 , first name @entity59			0
when @entity61 calls out to his patrons , asking for a ' leaky bum , ' everyone gets a laugh			0
distasteful : @entity65 makes a rape joke after trying to emulate @entity47 's signature @entity52 prank calls			1
the joke was revealed months before the show premiered and angered many beer drinkers : @entity73 and @entity74 spar over which beer is better -- the @entity76 or @entity1 's finest , @entity1 @entity77 : @entity78 and @entity79 have trouble hitting it off in the episode , and @entity78 even tells @entity79 to wear a bra next time she comes over @entity65 thinks that 's cool , and asks to make his own prank call			1
' hello , @entity61 ? ' he says			0
' your sister 's being raped			0
' other interactions were less charged			0
@entity89 and @entity90 strike up a friendship that leads sometimes - confident @entity89 to take always pitiful @entity90 under her wing for a little ego - building			0
@entity78 and @entity79 also strike up an acquaintance , though not one as constructive as their daughters			0
' @entity65 and @entity47 bond over weapons and hyper - intelligent @entity15 dog @entity97 is forced to make friends with the @entity89 's regular dog , @entity104 's @entity103			1
brothers in arms : @entity47 and @entity65 become friends once the evil @entity15 baby sees the eldest @entity89 's weapon collection			2

*sunday* 's @entity1 season 13 premier episode saw the @entity4 stuck in @entity9
the episode pokes fun at the shows ' years - long rivalry and show 's baby character @entity65 making a tasteless *sexual* assault joke
