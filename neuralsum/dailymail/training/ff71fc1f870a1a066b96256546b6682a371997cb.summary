chef @entity11 ( pictured ) is widely regarded as one of the best chefs in the @entity27			1
he has recently written his fourth cookbook , @entity10 , named after his restaurant in @entity22 the restaurant serves modern - @entity3 @entity27 - inspired dishes such as chicken tikka pie with wild berry chutney , @entity33 style seabass and chips served with cumin tempered peas and spiced tomato sauce , and scrambled duck egg served with @entity40 mackerel			1
the chef and restaurateur spoke to @entity43 about growing up in @entity17 , his philosophy of cuisine , and his tips for cooking @entity3 food at home			1
in @entity17 , you grew up in a foodie family			1
did you automatically want to become a chef ? no , i wanted to be a cricketer but that did n't happen unfortunately			1
growing up in a household where there were six of us - five sisters and a younger brother - food was always around us			1
@entity17 produces around 2,000 varieties of mangoes , and going through different mangoes through the seasons was a heck of a thing			1
my family was very into it ; my dad was very passionate about mangoes			1
he would make us taste them and that was a great learning			2
high end @entity3 dining : grilled scallops , smoked peppers and tomato chutney , served at at @entity10 what did you want to achieve when you moved to @entity27 ? when i arrived , i saw @entity3 food really in the dark ages			1
the way it was seen here , it was just curry			2
but i landed in the right place at the right time			2
the @entity27 was about to become the melting pot of cuisines			1
there were chefs like @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and many more who were changing the cuisine in this country and i kind of became part of the movement			2
as @entity10 is the subject of your new cookbook , what contributions do you feel the restaurant has made to the @entity27 food scene ? we have adapted and adopted - the culture , the cuisine , the ingredients - and brought two diverse cultures closer			1
we see ourselves as a @entity3 restaurant and we 're very proud of it			1
interesting flavours : tandoori chicken with pickled carrots and ginger , served at @entity10 we 've seen an influx of food trends in @entity27 in the past decade			1
has that affected they way you cook now ? to me , it 's inspirational			2
there are ingredients that are not from my cuisine , but i 'm motivated to bring that into my food			2
something like chia seeds , which is a hotly debated topic at the moment			2
it 's a super food and we use chia seed in making a drink in @entity17			2
but i created a dessert out of it			2
so , you come back into main play again and you 're on trend			0
what are your tips for cooking @entity3 style cuisine ? the simpler , the better			1
and get to know spices and start cooking with them			0
always use spices as if you 're using salt and pepper			0
if you go beyond that , perhaps you 'll shock your system and you wo n't go back			0
