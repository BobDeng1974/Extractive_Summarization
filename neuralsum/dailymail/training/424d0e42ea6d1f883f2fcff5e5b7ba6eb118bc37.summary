soft drink company @entity0 is closing the factory in the @entity2 that drew @entity4 star @entity3 into the dispute about @entity7 's occupation of the @entity9 territory			1
the company said the decision to move the factory to a location inside @entity7 was for ' purely commercial ' reasons and was not connected to pressure from @entity16 activists who had boycotted the company because of its location			1
a pro-palestinian boycott movement has targeted businesses that operate in the @entity2 , saying they benefit from @entity7 's occupation of the territory , which was captured in 1967 and is claimed by the @entity9			2
@entity3 endorsed soft drink maker @entity0 and cut her ties with @entity25 charity @entity24 after it criticised the @entity7 company for using a factory in the occupied @entity2 actress @entity3 got caught up in the controversy over the plant 's location earlier this year after she agreed to serve as @entity0 's global brand ambassador			1
the decision upset @entity24 , a humanitarian aid organization for which @entity3 had served as a global ambassador for eight years			1
the @entity36 star severed her ties with the @entity25 charity because of the dispute , citing ' fundamental differences of opinion			1
' the @entity4 star was @entity0 's global brand ambassador and defended the company 's decision to use the factory in the @entity2 , which employed local @entity9 @entity3 's deal with @entity0 was announced in january at a function with the company 's ceo @entity48 ( pictured left ) @entity0 said it was closing the @entity2 factory and moving operations to a site inside @entity7			1
the company said the decision was made for ' purely commercial ' reasons , though activists claim their boycott movement forced theshift in march , @entity3 denied her decision to join @entity0 was mistaken			1
" no , i stand behind that decision , " she told @entity60			0
" i was aware of that particular factory before i signed			0
and it still does n't seem like a problem – at least not until someone comes up with a solution to the closing of that factory and leaving all those people destitute			0
" the @entity9 boycott campaign welcomed wednesday 's announcement by @entity0 , saying its boycott caused retailers to drop @entity0 , known for its machines that allow users to make their own fizzy drinks			1
@entity0 representative @entity77 said the new location received a $ 20 million grant from the @entity7 government			2

the move is expected to be complete by the end of next year			0
@entity0 has defended the factory in the past , saying it employs hundreds of @entity9 and gives them equal benefits as @entity7 workers			2
most of them are from nearby @entity2 towns			0
the company said it would try to keep all of its workers at the new plant , though they will face lengthy commutes and need permits to work inside @entity7			0
for @entity9 workers from the nearby city of @entity103 , the new facility will be over 100 kilometers away			0
from @entity106 , another nearby city in the southern @entity2 , the commute will be about 50 kilometers			0

@entity114 , a spokesman for the @entity115 , said its campaign against @entity0 forced the company 's hand in the @entity2 decision			1
@entity3 appeared in high - profile ads for @entity0 during the @entity122 ' @entity0 ’s announcement today shows that the boycott , divestment and sanctions movement is increasingly capable of holding corporate criminals to account for their participation in @entity7 apartheid and colonialism , ' @entity123 said in a post on the group 's facebook page			1
' @entity135 campaign pressure has forced retailers across @entity137 and @entity138 to drop @entity0 , and the company ’s share price has tumbled in recent months as our movement has caused increasing reputational damage to the @entity0 brand			2
' he said , however , that @entity0 was implicated in the displacement of @entity9 even if the factory closure goes ahead , alleging it paid them less than @entity7 workers and forced them to work in sub-standard conditions .			2
