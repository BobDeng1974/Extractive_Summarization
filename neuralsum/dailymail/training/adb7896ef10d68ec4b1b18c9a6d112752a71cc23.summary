by @entity0 published : 09:08 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 11 september 2013 @entity1 unveiled the fingerprint scanner on its @entity3 on tuesday with bold claims about its high levels of encryption and security			1
the firm even suggested that its @entity10 system could revolutionise smartphone security and replace the traditional , everyday password			1
yet security researchers have warned that the technology is not perfect , with one adding that it ' provides little added security over a four - digit code			1
the @entity10 feature has been designed to replace passwords and phone pins and can be used to unlock the device but also pay for shopping and apps			1
experts predict it will kill off passwords for good touch id uses a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger			1
user can ' train ' their iphone to read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home button , the phone is unlocked			1
@entity10 can also be replace an @entity46 password when buying music , apps or books			2
it uses a ' laser cut sapphire crystal ' to take a high - resolution image scan before the @entity54 in @entity56 detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not			0
all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device 's chip			1
the prints are not stored on an @entity1 server , or backed up to @entity64			2
the @entity10 sensor is built into the premium phone 's ' home ' button and can be used to unlock the phone , as well as pay for shopping and apps automatically - effectively replacing the need for a password or pin			1
speaking at the launch event in @entity77 , @entity1 's senior vice president of worldwide marketing @entity78 said : ' half of smartphone customers do not set up passwords			1
[ @entity10 ] is an easier and more fun alternative			0
' it uses key you have with you everywhere you go			0
' it works by using a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger			2
a user can ' train ' their iphone to read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home button , the phone is unlocked			1
@entity10 can also replace an @entity46 password when buying music , apps or books			2
it uses a ' laser cut sapphire crystal ' to take a high - res image scan and the @entity54 in @entity56 determines whether the print belongs to the owner or not			0
@entity1 said it is designed to provide ' accurate readings from any angle , so the motion to unlock your device ought to be as automatic as it is now			2
' it is also designed to become more accurate the more it is used			0
@entity78 reassured users that @entity10 is secure by explaining that ' all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device 's chip ' adding the prints are not stored on an @entity1 server , or backed up to @entity64			1
yet security researchers are n't convinced			1
@entity124 from @entity125 wrote : in the past , [ fingerprint scanners ] have proven rather unreliable , plagued with security worries			0
the @entity3 scanner works by using a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger			1
it then uses a ' laser cut sapphire crystal ' to take a high - res image scan and the @entity54 in @entity56 determines whether the print belongs to the owner or not @entity1 's @entity78 , pictured , explained the scanner was secure because prints are saved to the chip , and not online			1
yet security researchers are concerned that prints can be stolen from anywhere ' fingerprints are not secret : we leave copies of them wherever we go			1
once someone devious has got hold of a copy , sensors can be fooled			0
' he continues that , unlike passwords , if fingerprint information is stolen it ca n't be changed			1
@entity157 , principal security researcher at @entity158 agreed : ' pin codes can be inconvenient meaning so many users fail to enable them altogether			0
' in this case , fingerprint scanning is better than nothing at all , but it provides little added security over a four - digit code			0
' because fingerprints can be lifted and duplicated , they should not be used as the sole credential			0
' speaking at a @entity174 event , @entity171 's manager of information security , @entity170 , recently announced that the ' game is over ' for passwords and that ' our relationship with passwords are done			2
' fingerprint authentication has become common in high - end laptops from companies such as @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185			0
@entity186 also added a fingerprint scanner to its @entity189 handset			2
@entity191 's chief information security officer predicted that the end of passwords was nigh in may but added biometric technology would n't take off until @entity1 introduced it to a handset			1
@entity197 , founder of @entity198 added that the release of the @entity3 may be the ' catalyst ' needed to make the technology mainstream and fuel the demise of the password further			0
although the security features of @entity1 's @entity10 have not been fully tested , research from @entity205 said there is a danger in assuming ' fingerprint recognition alone will stop the deluge of data streaming to cyber criminals and competitors			1
' fingerprint authentication has become common in high - end laptops			0
@entity186 also added a fingerprint scanner to its @entity189 handset			2
however , @entity191 's chief information security officer claimed the technology would n't become mainstream until @entity1 added it to a handset , like on the @entity3 , pictured @entity220 carried out by password experts @entity222 found that many people suffer from what 's been dubbed ' password amnesia '			1
the survey discovered that 34 per cent of consumers need to remember more than five different passwords on a daily basis			0
21.6 per cent need to remember more than eight different passwords the password easiest to remember is a @entity233 login ( 34.5 per cent ) ahead of work log - in ( 25 per cent ) , online retailer ( 10.6 per cent ) and online banking ( 12.2 per cent ) @entity237 , global director of gadget insurer @entity238 added : ' being able to use fingerprint security login for @entity241 purchases is a nice touch , if it works			2
' but while biometrics are typically seen as more robust than password protection – sweat , dirty pockets , hot and cold environments , sun exposure , and other factors can affect the sensitivity and working conditions of the sensor surface			0
' @entity237 also told @entity254 that one of the most common claims for accidental damage to @entity258 is screens shattering and he voiced concerns that the phone 's durability could be an issue , especially if the fingerprint technology is fragile			0
however , not everyone was as quick to dismiss the technology			0
@entity267 , security analyst for @entity268 told @entity254 : i see adding this feature as a good move on the security side of things and i hope more manufacturers consider adding security measures due to how popular mobile devices are			0
' fingerprint readers for the most part , are a secure method of authentication			0
it ’s not perfect but this new technology will hopefully be an easy authentication step for users to take in securing their phones			0

@entity1 's @entity3 has a fingerprint scanner built into the ' home ' button
the @entity10 feature lets users unlock their device and buy apps securely
experts claim it could spell the end of traditional passwords
yet security researchers warn that prints can still be stolen and once *compromised* , ca n't be changed
