by @entity0 published : 03:30 est , 9 july 2012 updated : 05:36 est , 9 july 2012 an island offering a secluded beach , promises of great fishing and stunning views of the @entity7 skyline is up for sale — and at a heavily discounted price			1
@entity10 , a 6 - acre mass of rock tucked away in a northern part of @entity14 , is now being offered for just under $ 5 million after being listed for $ 22 million earlier this year			1
its owner @entity15 is now so desperate to flog the land he has clashed the asking price by $ 18			1
bargain : @entity10 is on the marked for $ 5milllion after the owner slashed the asking price of $ 22million mineral rights for the property , which contains manganese in its rocky outcroppings , are negotiable			1
the undeveloped island has been on and off the market for years and relator @entity27 said he advised mr @entity15 that the way to sell was by ' whittling away at the price			1
' dishing out a few million dollars for a 5.78 - acre property — especially one with no house or other structure — is not for everyone			0
but @entity27 notes that if and when the island is sold , the new owner will have some unique opportunities			0
sitting about six miles north of @entity7 , just off the south side of the @entity41 , @entity10 is not just off the beaten path , it 's not on any path — and does n't even appear on some maps			1
accessible only by boat or helicopter , and with no crowds of tourists swarming about , this island offers what may be the ultimate in a secluded getaway			1
@entity27 said : ' you could go out there and have wild parties or retreat away from the wild parties , ' he added that the new owner also would have the ' bragging rights ' of owning their own private island in @entity14			0
then there 's the chance to escape @entity7 's gloomy and damp summer days with a quick trip to his or her island retreat , with a relaxing day of basking in the sun. ' @entity10 is out of fog bank , ' @entity27 said			1
' if @entity7 is in the fog , you may be sitting in the sunshine			2
' if you want to get out of the sunshine , be sure to bring your own umbrella			0
there are no structures on the island			0
all that stands is a flagpole and its supporting wires			0
tempted ? the island has no structures in place but could be a good fishing spot for keen anglers over the years , ideas have been floated to remove dirt and rock from part of the island and sell it for use in roadway construction , and to build a hotel on the remaining land , though none of those ideas have been implemented			2
the only person to ever call @entity10 ' home ' for any period was a man named @entity98 who built a cabin on the island and lived there from 1851 to 1856			2
possible loneliness aside , @entity27 points out that the new owner also would enjoy great fishing and a distant view of the @entity105 races when the event comes to @entity7 in 2013			1
but taking ownership of the island may turn out to be a long - term proposition , with no guarantee of being able to sell it for a quick profit			0
according to @entity112 mr @entity15 , a retired business owner , took possession of property from @entity115 , sometime in the 1970s			2
@entity115 had bought the land in the early 1960s , asking $ 10 million for the island and another $ 10 million for mineral rights , with the hopes of cashing in on the then - increased demand for rock and gravel as parts of @entity14 were filled in for development			2
@entity115 never sold the island , but ended up turning it over to @entity124 in exchange for some debts , @entity27 said			0
@entity115 has since died , and @entity15 rarely visits the island			0
' if somebody came up with some money , i would sell it ; otherwise , i 'll leave it to my sons to get even with them , ' he told the @entity133 earlier this year .			0

@entity10 in @entity7 is completely undeveloped and is accessible only by boat or helicopter
in a desperate bid to sell the land *current* owner @entity15 has slashed the asking price by $ 18
