by @entity0 while @entity2 was snapped smoking and drinking before the new @entity6 season , team - mate @entity1 took a more laid - back approach to his holiday			1
@entity1 was seen relaxing with friends on the exclusive @entity10 in @entity11 ahead of his pres - season training with @entity13			0

chilled : @entity1 relaxing with friends in the south of @entity25 busted : @entity2 was caught smoking for the second time in the space of a year @entity1 seemed at ease after a difficult summer			0
despite showing some promising form in @entity33 's friendlies before the @entity34 , the 20 - year - old former @entity30 star was injured in a warm - up game and failed to make a single appearance during the dismal campaign			2
that knee injury , sustained during @entity33 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity40 , and a further problem with his groin have led to @entity1 enduring another frustrating summer after being plagued by fitness problems last season			1
with the signing of @entity50 , competition for places is hotting up at the @entity51 and @entity1 will be hoping that he is up to the challenge			0
