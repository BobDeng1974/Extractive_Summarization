he was so terrified as he approached the departure gate he would slump to the floor sobbing with stomach cramps			0
mr @entity7 , 62 , an ex-aide to former deputy prime minister @entity65 , said : ‘ it just happened out of the blue and the fear is quite acute			2
he was fine until he got to check - in and then he fell apart			0

the @entity96 say they spent £ 40,000 on cancelled flights , on accommodation during their extended stay and on treatments to try to cure @entity7 ’s fear of flying			2
after four attempts to get his son on a plane , mr @entity7 began planning an alternative journey by car through @entity107 to @entity108 , where they would board a cargo ship to @entity111 , but they were blocked by visa complications			2
after that @entity7 was treated by a number of specialists and psychiatrists without success			2
but earlier this year hypnotherapist @entity24 , a @entity6 ex-pat living in the neighbouring emirate of @entity120 , contacted the family and offered to help			1
after three months of treatment , @entity7 finally plucked up the courage to board a @entity125 flight from @entity120 to @entity32			1
accompanied by mr @entity24 and his father , he held his nerve and touched down yesterday at 5.30am @entity6 time after a seven - and - a - half hour flight			1

‘ @entity7 started having a meltdown at the airport , but we worked through it			2
on board i was able to calm him using hypnosis techniques			0
i had prepared for this flight weeks ago during our therapy sessions , using the power of hypnotic suggestion , meaning @entity7 already had the tools for success deeply planted into his subconscious mind			0
he just was n’t necessarily aware of it			0
‘ only in the most extreme cases of flying phobia would an accompanied flight be needed but @entity7 ’s anxiety and panic was off the scale			0
i said it was possible to get him home and i ’m thrilled i did it			0
