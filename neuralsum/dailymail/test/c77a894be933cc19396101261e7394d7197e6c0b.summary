when @entity1 , 28 , moved into a quiet cul - de - sac in @entity3 just over a year ago , she thought she had found the perfect place to call home			1
but within a week of moving in , her dream home turned into a nightmare thanks to an aggressive neighbour with a penchant for watching tv with the volume turned up at all hours of the day			1
unable to sleep because of the racket , the photography student asked unemployed @entity14 , 56 , to turn it down - but was met with a barrage of abuse that culminated , a year later , in violent threats and stalking			1
terrified : @entity1 , 28 , was subjected to vile verbal abuse and was stalked by her neighbour now ms @entity1 has been forced to move home because of mr @entity14 but says she lives in terror of him discovering her new address			1
ms @entity1 's ordeal began less than a week after moving into her ground floor flat , which she did despite having been warned that the previous occupants also had trouble with mr @entity14			1
' i was told that the previous tenants antagonised him but i 'm obviously not like that so i did n't think it would be a problem , ' she said			0
then the daily barrage of noise began			2
' on the first morning , i was laid in bed and it was about 6am and all of a sudden , there was this noise			2
' the tv was on at full blast to the point that you could hear what he was watching			2
the ceilings are really low so it was right above my bed			0
' after a week , ms @entity1 approached her neighbour to ask whether he would mind turning the sound down a bit but found herself on the receiving end of an expletive - laden tirade			1
aggressive : @entity14 , 56 , waged a year - long campaign of terror against ms @entity1 quiet : ms @entity1 and mr @entity14 were neighbours in this quiet cul - de - sac in @entity3 ' i got this explosion , this tirade of abuse , ' she remembers			1
' then he ran off and went into his flat and i was just totally shocked			0
it was the first time i 'd met him and that 's what i got from him			2
' the noise continued , with ms @entity1 forced to resort to headphones in order to get any sleep at all			1
worse still , mr @entity14 began to subject her to vile tirades every time he spotted her in the street or over the garden fence			1
incensed , ms @entity1 got in touch with the local @entity77			1
although ordered to turn his television down , the 28 - year - old says mr @entity14 's new leaf lasted for just seven days			1
' he kept to that for about a week and then he just crept back up again and it went back to how it was before			0
' finally at breaking point , ms @entity1 snapped and banged on the ceiling with a broom handle during a cleaning session			1
mr @entity14 responded by banging on her front door and , when confronted and accused of bullying by ms @entity1 , threw a 3ft wooden pole at her			1
damage : as well as threatening violence , mr @entity14 nailed the shed door shut ( see photo held by ms @entity1 ) traumatised : ms @entity1 says her year of living next door to mr @entity14 was the worst of her life as the situation at home worsened , it began to affect all areas of ms @entity1 's life , with mr @entity14 even turning up at her workplace			1
her family were also affected , with mr @entity14 physically threatening her step - mother and father when they visited ms @entity1 's home			1
' mr @entity14 came out , he was shouting and swearing as usual and red in the face , ' she remembers			1
' he had a massive rock on top of his bin			0
' my step - mum was standing close to the fence and he held it over his head as high as it could go and said " i 'm going to kill you "			2
' my dad ran forward and put his hand out to stop it			0
i was just totally shocked and i feared for my step - mum 's life			2
if he 'd have dropped it on her , he would definitely have killed her			0
' the police were called and mr @entity14 was handed an injunction that prevented him from approaching or speaking to ms @entity1			1
but even that was n't enough to stop him			0
' i think he was scared for a bit and did n't want to get into any trouble , ' she says			0
' but then his actual personality must have got the better of him because he started again a few weeks later			0
' instead of overtly harassing me , he would follow me down the street			2
you could hear it was him because of his stick			0
' everywhere i went , he turned up , he was there			0
it made me feel really paranoid because every time i walked down the street , i could feel his eyes on the back of my head			2
' by now at her wits end , ms @entity1 says every part of her life was suffering			1
' it was affecting everything in my life , ' she says			0
' it was affecting my studies because i could n't sleep			2
it was affecting my work because i had everything going on at once and it was just ridiculous			2
' my hair started falling out because i was just that stressed about it all			0
' eventually , ms @entity1 installed a @entity158 camera and was finally able to gather the evidence she needed to prove mr @entity14 was breaking the terms of the injunction			1
in october 2014 , he was issued with a new injunction that said he would face immediate arrest should he become violent or threaten it			0
but for ms @entity1 , it was too little , too late and she has now moved into a new home away from mr @entity14			1
' it 's been the worst year of my life , ' she says			0
' i 've been depressed			0
it 's affected my relationships with people			0
' i do n't want him to find out where i live [ now ] because i 'm sure he would do something			0
he is that type of person and that does scare me			0
