@entity0 will be on the plane on tuesday when @entity3 's advance party fly to @entity4 to prepare for the first test , but he wo n't be in the starting line - up			1
barring a fundamental shift in management thinking over the next week , @entity7 will emerge from a season of personal trials and tribulations to start the series opener against the @entity14 at @entity15			2
in the enforced absence of @entity17 and @entity18 - due to fixture congestion - and the injured @entity19 , the 24 - year - old @entity7 will be thrust into the no 10 shirt and entrusted with the playmaker 's role in a selection decision based more on familiarity than form			1
backing : @entity7 will emerge from a tough season to start for @entity3 against the @entity14 @entity7 has been a regular fixture in the national set - up for two years , although his last @entity5 appearance was on tour in @entity31 last june			1
since then , his game has collapsed during the protracted saga of his move from @entity35 to @entity36 , to the point where he was often an unused replacement for the @entity39 with @entity40 taking over at fly - half			1
yet he is destined to be selected in @entity4 ahead of @entity0 , who was included in the initial group of 30 players flying from @entity44 to prepare for the first encounter with the world champions at a venue where they are unbeaten since 1994			1
this first batch of players will be supplemented next week by those involved in saturday 's @entity53 final			0
last week , @entity3 head coach @entity54 recalled @entity0 - who last played for his country in 2008 - but he gave clear indications that @entity7 remains above him in the no 10 hierarchy			1
' @entity0 has played well on a number of occasions , but there are areas of his game he could do better , ' he said			2
' i would n't go so far as to say that the ( form ) difference between the two has been vast			0
' i think @entity7 found some form towards the end of the season			2
equally , there were one or two other players who had n't played well for their clubs coming into the @entity3 side for the @entity72 who managed to deliver great performances			2
recall : fly - half @entity0 last played for @entity3 in 2008 @entity0 age : 26			1
height : 6ft @entity78 : 14st @entity79 : @entity80 ( joined 2012 ) former clubs : @entity82 ( 2004 - 10 ) , @entity83 ( 2011 - 12 ) @entity3 appearances : 7england points : @entity87 debut : won33 - 10 v @entity88 , march 2008 @entity7 age : 24			1
height : 6ft @entity91 : 13st @entity92 : @entity36 ( from june 1 ) former clubs : @entity35 ( 2007 - 14 ) @entity3 appearances : 3england points : @entity97 debut : won 38 - 21 @entity98 , december 2012 ' @entity99 is a good example and @entity40 - both playing for the same club ( as @entity7 )			1
you back your coaches , you back your system and your ability to get the best out of people			0
you can regenerate form and belief in a player if you put them in the right environment			0
once @entity7 became aware of the opportunity in front of him , he has stood up as i expected him to and led the team			2
' assessing @entity0 , @entity54 added : ' he 's been quite quiet actually off the field			2
i do n't know what the perception is but certainly he 's quite quiet			0
he 's been very diligent in making sure he 's up to speed with learning the plays and calls			0
' on the field it is a slightly different way of attack that we 've generated here , different from the way he 's been coached before			0
i think he 's enjoyed that part of the reintroduction to the @entity3 team , working with @entity131 and @entity132 in particular			0
' he 's been good on the field , growing in terms of his presence and leadership , because obviously as fly - half you have to have a voice , you have to be able to boss people around			1
i think his game 's improving in that way as well			0
he 's a little bit behind @entity7 in that regard because @entity7 has had so much time and experience with us over the last two years			0
challenge : @entity149 has started on the back foot for @entity3 coach @entity54 ' even though @entity7 has n't played as many games for us in the last two years as someone like @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , he has been in the camp a long time , so as a consequence he understands it a little bit better			1
' @entity3 's coaches are optimistic that @entity40 will have recovered from an ankle injury in time for the second test in @entity161 , perhaps even the first at a push			1
they are also refusing to rule out the seemingly remote prospect of first - choice hooker @entity164 playing some part in the tour			0
' my understanding is he is very , very close now , ' said @entity54			0
' we are sat here a week and a half away from a first test he would n't have played anyway ( due to @entity173 commitments ) , and two - and - a - half weeks away from the second test			1
impressive : @entity175 has been rewarded for fine end - of - season form with @entity3 call ' there 's a very good chance he 's going to be ready by that point			2
you have a player of that experience available to us in a position where we 've lost some experience , so if he came through this weekend , i 'd be reasonably certain he 'll be on the plane			0
' @entity175 has been rewarded for fine end - of - season form with a return to the ranks , while @entity194 full back @entity192 is in the mix for a test debut as @entity197 of @entity198 is struggling with a suspected hamstring strain			0
@entity54 and his assistants are awaiting medical bulletins concerning @entity17 and @entity202 , and they must hope to avoid any mishaps involving their scrum - halves , fly - halves or loosehead props , given the presence of just two men in each position in the squad departing today .			1

@entity7 will be thrust into the no 10 shirt in enforced absence of @entity17 and @entity18
fly - half is destined to be selected in @entity4 ahead of @entity0
@entity3 optimistic that @entity40 will be fit for the second test
