training budgets for nursery staff have been slashed by 40 per cent , @entity0 can reveal as minister scramble to secure a deal on cutting crippling childcare bills			1
@entity6 and @entity7 last night failed to agree a deal on giving more help with the cost of looking after their children , including offering tax breaks to working parents and tearing up red - tape for nurseries and childminders			2
but new figures reveal councils across @entity20 have dramatically cut funding budgets to train new childcare staff , undermining hopes of a massive expansion in the sector to reduce costs			1
council training budgets for childminders and nursery staff have been cut by 40 per cent in a year , new figures show @entity31 education secretary @entity30 , who obtained the figures , said parents are ‘ rightly frightened ’ at the prospect of the quality of care being hit			1
in an article for @entity0 , mr @entity30 also warned that plans to copy the @entity39 system where staff can look after eight children at once – up from four in the @entity42 – will fail to reduce costs			1
but the government accused him of ' total opportunism and incoherence on childcare ' after backing the @entity49 system where there are no ratios at all			2
mr @entity30 writes : ‘ @entity6 needs to make sure he does n’t repeat the same mistakes he ’s already made – he could make the right choices and improve the childcare system for parents but the real fear is that their plans will cause collateral damage : cutting the quality of childcare			1
' @entity62 's @entity30 warns working parents will be ' rightly frightened ' by reductions in the quality of care for their children he urged the government to follow the @entity49 childcare system which ' gives parents choice , affordability and good quality places '			1
but education minister @entity72 hit back , saying the @entity49 system has no ratio rules at all			0
‘ @entity30 has today exposed @entity62 ’s total opportunism and incoherence on childcare			1
' he starts by attacking the idea of loosening staff : child ratios but in the next breath he says we should move to the @entity49 system – where they have no compulsory ratios at all			0
' either he is deliberately pulling the wool over people ’s eyes , or he does n’t know what he is talking about			0
‘ after thirteen years in power , @entity62 left behind a childcare system where parents faced the highest costs of any major country besides @entity93 and staff were paid barely more than the minimum wage			1
' the fact he has made such a basic error proves you ca n’t trust @entity62 on childcare			1
’ it comes as a new study found families living in deprived areas are more likely to receive a poorer standard of childcare			2
@entity62 used freedom of information laws to reveal how much councils have spent on training for the early years workforce and supporting childcare providers to employ well - qualified staff			1
in 2010 - 11 almost 140 councils in @entity20 spent £ 93.3million but a year later the budget had been cut by 40 per cent to £ 56million			1
mr @entity30 adds : ‘ the government has slashed the budget for training for nursery staff , putting quality at risk			2
in four areas – @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 , there is now no money available for councils to provide nursery staff training			2
’ just 15 councils increased their spending year - on - year			0
miss @entity72 this week revealed she was considering overhauling staffing ratios to help reduce running costs for nurseries and childminders			0
it is hoped that reducing the red - tape burden on employers will help to bring down childcare bills which sees @entity42 parents spending more than a quarter of their income on looking after their children			2
education minister @entity72 accused @entity62 of ' total opportunism and incoherence on childcare ' but mr @entity30 pointed to a survey of childminders which showed that 81 per cent said that if the maximum ratios were increased , they would not charge parents less per hour			1
‘ the government plans to cut back on childcare standards and safeguards – under the guise of deregulation			2
‘ this means that childminders could be looking after eight toddlers , instead of three or four under current rules			0
‘ most parents say one toddler can be a handful – they will worry that child safety could be at risk , as well as the quality of early learning			0
’ according to a new report from the @entity169 think tank , around six in 10 childminders working in the most disadvantaged areas are rated as good or better by @entity170 , compared to 77 per cent childminders in the richest areas			0
the study , due to be published at the end of the month , suggests that only around one in 10 nurseries and childminders were rated outstanding by @entity170 last year			0
the report is due to call for the government to focus on improving the quality of early years education , and suggest that @entity180 - which trains top graduates to work in schools in disadvantaged areas - should be extended to pre-school education			0
report author @entity185 said : ' early years education will only have a positive impact on a child 's development if it is of a high quality			0
while provision is improving , it 's not doing so fast enough			0
" most worryingly of all , lower quality provision in disadvantaged areas means positive effects of early years education are less likely to be seen for the children who need it most			0
