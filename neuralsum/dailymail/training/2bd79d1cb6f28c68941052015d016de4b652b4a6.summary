by @entity0 published : 09:40 est , 29 august 2013 updated : 09:40 est , 29 august 2013 at first glance , this slide looks like a fun playground toy for children			1
but anyone who tried it out would get a nasty shock - when they plummeted 40ft down the side of the building			0
the slide has horrified locals in eastern @entity13 who are concerned that kids might reach the roof where it is located			1
watch out below : this slide is located on top of a three - storey building and leads straight off the side the frame is placed on top of a three - storey factory in @entity24 , @entity25 province , where the slides are manufactured			1
it is located so that the end of the slide leads straight off the building , so that any foolish thrill - seeker would drop directly onto a concrete car park			1
@entity32 have voiced fears that the colourful object could prove irrestible to teenagers			0
' we worry that our children might get in there at weekends and try to play on it , ' one said			0
' you 'd have to be mad to put a slide there			1
' tempting ? locals are concerned that children could climb up to the roof and use the slide factory managers say the slide is meant to advertise the company 's wares , and is not intended to be used by anyone			2
however , following the local outcry , they have agreed to take the object away			0
' we can understand people 's fears so we will be removing the slide , ' a spokesman said			2
this is not the first time that @entity13 authorities have been blasted for showing an apparently lax regard for public safety			0
earlier this month , a five - year - old boy was left bruised and bloodied when he was propelled into the air by excessively powerful water jets at a public fountain in @entity70 province			2
sometimes it is members of the public themselves who court danger - in february , two tourists at a national park were pictured riding on top of a cable car .			0

slide is located on top of toy manufacturer in @entity25 province
*bosses* say it is an advertising tool and is not supposed to be used
