the best match of this @entity1 so far ended on wednesday night with one of the protagonists on his knees , theatrically praying that a @entity6 line call would save him			1
@entity8 veteran @entity7 had wowed the @entity9 with his antics and rocked @entity11 with the consistent quality of his old school tennis , briefly threatening to provide the first dramatic upset of the 2014 edition			1
yet just at the death , when it seemed we could be heading for a classic decider , the world number two reached inside himself to clinch a 6 - 4 6 - 3 6 - 7 7 - 6 victory with a rasping forehand that clipped the sideline			0
roar of delight : @entity11 celebrates winning a point against @entity7 on day three at @entity1 @entity11 hits a forehand on @entity9 during his victory against @entity7 anxious wait : @entity7 watches a @entity6 challenge on a big screen on @entity9 worth the wait : the @entity8 celebrates after @entity6 awarded him the point over @entity11 video @entity11 battles past @entity7 the @entity9 rose as one to acclaim the combatants , and the relief at the replay screen will have been felt not just by @entity11 but also by his coach @entity40 seated up in his player box			1
@entity7 plays a wonderful brand of the sport , caressing the ball with soft hands and delighting the public with an animated demeanour that goes against the grain of stoic seriousness now so prevalent			2
his histrionics clearly riled @entity11 at certain points , and contributed to a general unease which suggests that the @entity53 might be a little more vulnerable this year after yet another @entity55 final setback at the @entity56			1
@entity57 , who went through in such contrasting fashion , might have allowed himself to take note as he is due to have a repeat of last year ’s final a week tomorrow in the last four			0
the 35 year - old @entity8 , playing in his twelfth championships , could so easily have pushed this one the full distance			2
having come back from 2 - 5 down in the second tiebreak to 5 - 5 thanks to some uncharacteristic wobbling from @entity11 he netted a straightforward volley that would have given him a set point			1
down but not out : the @entity53 lies on his back after the end of another gruelling point guiding hand : @entity11 's mentor , @entity40 , watches proceedings from the players ' box do n't try this at home : @entity11 displays his incredible athleticism to hit a forehand all smiles : @entity11 's girlfriend , @entity82 , looked impressed by her beau 's efforts while not entirely convincing the second seed is still not a man who needs a second invitation , and he finished it on his first chance , generously pointing to his opponent afterwards as they soaked up the acclaim			1
it was not the only time the 27 year - old from @entity93 had shown the better side of his nature			0
in the eleventh game of the fourth set at deuce he had sportingly conceded a point by admitting that an incorrect call had not interfered with his shot that went out			0
the whole effect was a reminder that it need not be a @entity57 command performance to bring the old arena to its feet			0
@entity106 said : ‘ i should not have complicated my life in this way , but credit to him , he ’s an entertainer and loves the big stage			0
’ the whole effect was a reminder that it need not be a @entity57 command performance to bring the old arena to its feet			0
so far the big upsets of last year have not come , and the likes of @entity11 will feel more sure of themselves as the slick new grass courts become harder and browner as the fortnight progresses			2
the @entity53 , who could have wrapped it up in straight sets , is relying here on @entity40 with his long - term mentor @entity124 sitting back at home , where he has pledged to spend more time			1
the reduced team will have plenty to debate before his next outing , against @entity132 @entity131			0
worth the applause : @entity7 hit the deck on many occasions as he threw his all into the match @entity138 played : the pair embrace after the match in a warm and respectful gesture			2

@entity11 beat @entity7 in @entity1 second round
no 1 seed was made to work hard by @entity8 veteran but won in four sets
@entity11 won @entity150 *tournament* in 2011
@entity53 gave his opponent a point in *extraordinary* sporting gesture
