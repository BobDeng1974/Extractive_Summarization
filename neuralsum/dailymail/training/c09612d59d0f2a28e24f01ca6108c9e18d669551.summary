by @entity0 for june @entity1 , 53 , from @entity2 in @entity3 , may is always the hardest month			1
for , on a sunny spring day in 2008 , two of her children were brutally murdered by her violent ex-husband			1
@entity9 , a disabled 25 - year - old who needed round - the - clock care was stabbed 12 times while her little brother @entity13 , just seven years old , was injured 14 times			1
now , almost six years later , mrs @entity9 says she will never get over their deaths and still feels guilty that she was n't there to protect them			1
' the sentence was disgusting - that made me sick to my stomach , ' she says			2
' how can you put a value on a child ’s life , eight and a half years for a child , for two children who could n't defend themselves and had their whole life in front of them			1
' that is disgusting , the law is absurd			2
' mrs @entity9 , who has two other sons , one of whom is estranged , first met @entity1 , known to his family as @entity47 , when she was just 17 years old			1
despite his previous convictions for violence and a controlling personality , she fell in love and in 1981 , the couple were married			2
gone : june 's disabled daughter @entity53 , 25 , had defensive wounds and was stabbed 12 times heartbreaking : @entity56 , 7 , was murdered while playing computer games in his bedroom @entity60 swiftly moved to cut off contact with june 's friends and family and less than a year later , she was pregnant with daughter @entity53			1
' when we first got married i never really got to see any of my friends , and i never got to see my family , ' she remembers			0
' we moved , he moved me up to @entity3 , and my sister did phone one day , because she ’d been trying to get in contact with me , and he picked up the phone , told my sister not to contact me again and never to phone this number , so i had lost all family contacts as well			1
' his violent temper , never far from the surface , resurfaced during her pregnancy and when @entity53 was born with severe learning difficulties , he was furious			1
worse , as their family expanded , @entity60 began to turn his fists on the children - eldest son @entity83 in particular			1
' he ’d batter me black and blue , ' remembers @entity83			0
' if i got caught smoking at school , he would take a belt and batter me with the buckle , i was just covered in bruises			0
' i think he , like , enjoyed the power of it , being the one in control			0
he made you scared of him			0
' june too suffered regular beatings , frequently in front of the children who were powerless to help their mother			1
it took another attack on @entity83 for her to pluck up the courage to leave			0
' it was one thing being violent to me , but it was a different thing being violent to my kids , so i just got the kids and i left , ' she remembers			2
but when she allowed @entity47 access to the three children , he spirited the family away to the @entity112 , where he threatened to remain unless june came home			2
happier times : although @entity60 was violent , the early years of june 's marriage were relatively happy ' he said if i wanted to see the kids again i would need to promise to come back to him , so i did , because i knew if i did n't do that then he would have stayed in @entity119 and it might have took me years and years to get my kids back , and i could n't cope with that			1
' back with @entity47 , june soon became pregnant for a fourth time , giving birth to her youngest son @entity13 at the age of 41			1
' when i found out i was pregnant with @entity13 i was so shocked at first , but then i was happy , ' she remembers			1
' everybody just adored him [ when he was born ] , and @entity53 just could n't keep her hands off of him ; she loved him and she was so motherly towards him			1
' ' my wee brother was everything to me , ' adds @entity83			0
' me and my wee bro went everywhere together , we just had a really strong bond , and we were just always together			0
' despite her happiness , her relationship with the increasingly violent @entity60 continued to deteriorate and by the time @entity13 was seven , it was damaged beyond repair			1
loved : @entity53 and @entity13 , the baby of the family , were much loved by their mother and two brothers evil : @entity60 is taken away in handcuffs from an @entity148 court after being found guilty of murder when @entity60 threatened to send @entity53 to a care home , june had had enough and began divorce proceedings			1
a few days before a custody hearing on the 2nd may 2008 , @entity60 arrived , angry and swearing , at june 's new home			1
' he came , and he ’d said to me , ' what you gon na do when you ’re all alone and you ’ve no got any kids there ? you ’ll just be all alone on your own " and i just laughed at him			0
i just assumed he was talking about him getting custody			0
' when the hearing arrived , june was given full custody of the children but agreed to allow @entity47 access visits			2
that night , he phoned his eldest son @entity83 , by then living in @entity167			0
' he ’d said to @entity168 that he wanted him to come up so that he could talk some sense into me , ' remembers june , ' @entity83 just told him , " my mum ’s never going back to you " and that he was a monster and he hated him and he wanted nothing ever to do with him			0
' ' my dad was sneaky , ' adds @entity83 , ' and i knew that i would be his first target			0
out of everybody i would have been his first			0
' the very next day , june agreed to let @entity60 have @entity53 and @entity13 for the afternoon			1
when she dropped them off at his home on 3rd may 2008 at 3.30pm , it would turn out to be the last time she would see them alive			2
' the last words i said to @entity13 was " right , okey - dokey , i ’ll be back to pick you up just shortly " , she remembers			1
' and i went back a couple of hours later , just expecting to pick them up			0
instead i found their dead bodies			0
' @entity13 was lying on the bed and his mouth was open , and his lips were blue , and i knew he was dead			1
i went through to @entity53 ’s bed and @entity53 was dead , lying in her bed , and her eyes were open and her mouth was open and the whole room was just a bloodbath			1
' @entity13 , the first child to die , had been stabbed 14 times as he sat playing on a computer game			1
his sister @entity53 had been attacked 12 times and had defensive wounds all over her arms			2
scene : forensic teams and police officers surround the @entity2 home where @entity53 and @entity13 died guilt : june , seen here leaving court , says she will always feel guilty about what happened ' that ’s the bit that tortures me more than anything , ' adds june			1
' knowing , you know , that he was killing them and they ’d be wanting their mum there , and i was n't there to protect them			2
' that ’s the bit that tortures me all the time , that will never stop torturing me			0
because i was n't there to protect them			0
' shockingly , their killer father showed no remorse , even , according to the police constable who arrested him , attempting to control the police interview that followed			2
' when @entity1 came into our custody he was very matter of fact , ' reveals @entity234 who worked on the case			0
' he showed no remorse and he never asked for his children once			2
' and although @entity60 was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 17 years at his trial , for his murdered children 's mother and older brother , the nightmare continues			1
' i just never , ever can describe the pain at that moment when i saw @entity13 ’s body , ' adds june			2
' i can never , ever describe that pain , it was absolutely horrendous			0
' i can never , ever forgive him [ @entity60 ] for what he ’s done , for taking the children ’s lives			1
why did n’t he just take mine and let them live ? i never , ever can forgive him for that			0
' ' i was destroyed , ' adds @entity83			0
' everything was wrecked , everything			0
i ’ve lost a family ; the only one i ’ve really got left is my mum			0
' ' i still feel guilty , that guilt will never leave me , ' reveals june			2
' i do n’t think there will ever be a time when i wo n't feel guilty for not being there when they really needed me to protect them			0
it ’s like a living nightmare			0
' june and @entity83 appear on @entity274 's @entity273 , sunday 13 april at 9pm on @entity275 ( @entity276 553 , @entity277 and @entity278 433 )			0

their mother @entity284 , 53 , from @entity3 , says she still feels guilty
mrs @entity287 suffered years of *domestic* violence at @entity60 's hands
according to mrs @entity9 , killing the children was his revenge
