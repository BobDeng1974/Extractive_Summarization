when it ’s bitterly cold outside and dark before 5pm , what could be more comforting than a mug of hot chocolate ? but which one should you choose ? we enlisted the help of chocolate expert @entity7 , a judge at the @entity8 who also runs @entity9 , an events company that seeks out the best chocolate experiences			1
@entity14 ’s @entity13 £ 6.29 for 300g , montezuma.co.uk @entity7 says : @entity15 and chocolate go together like strawberries and cream			1
but while this has a generous hit of chocolate — 73 per cent — the chilli ’s a little overpowering			1
we say : so easy to make			0
at 189 calories per serving , it ’s ideal for a snack - sized pick - me - up			0
4/5 @entity28 £ 3.75 for 150g , @entity29 @entity7 says : the real deal — 100 per cent quality @entity32 cacao			1
you can drink it like an espresso or add milk and sugar			0
we say : a faff to make			0
you put three cocoa discs per cup into a pan and heat gently until they melt then add milk			1
but it ’s a low 150 calories per serving			0
5/5 @entity50 £ 2 for 150g , @entity29 @entity7 says : the rich aroma of top - quality @entity53 cocoa beans hits me before i ’ve taken my first sip			1
there ’s no added salt or other flavourings , a generous 40 per cent cocoa and only 162 calories per serving			1
but , disappointingly , the drink itself is grainy , a bit like a chocolate cup - a - soup			1
we say : this won a @entity68 food award last year			0
simply mix three heaped teaspoons with a little milk and top up with hot milk			0
3/5 @entity72 £ 2.60 for 370g , @entity73 ’s @entity7 says : the label recommends using hot water rather than milk which means , at 80 calories , it ’s diet - friendly			1
but it ’s revolting — like drinking chocolate - flavoured water			2
it ’s only got 3 per cent @entity72 chocolate , too , and is packed with additives and sweeteners			1
we say : although it promises a ‘ silky smooth ’ drink , the cup is full of powdery lumps			2
1/5 options @entity91 @entity90 £ 2 for 220g , @entity92 @entity7 says : for a low calorie drink ( 38 calories per serving ) , it ’s surprisingly satisfying			1
it tastes like restaurant mint chocolates — impressive as it ’s only 20 per cent cocoa			2
you make it with water , but the added acacia gum gives it a nice creamy taste			0
we say : we found it had a cloying taste			0
2/5 @entity108 ’s @entity107 £ 1.50 for 250g , @entity92 @entity7 says : i ’ve loved @entity108 ’s since childhood			1
but my taste buds are more sophisticated now , and with just 25 per cent cocoa and 165 calories per serving , the chocolate hit is n’t great here			1
but all those lovely memories make this nostalgia in a cup			2
we say : just add three heaped teaspoons to a cup of hot milk			2
but it ’s very sweet.2 / 5 @entity123 and @entity124 £ 4.99 for 300g , @entity29 @entity7 says : the tiny flakes are made from a generous 51 per cent cocoa			1
no wonder it smells like a good - quality chocolate bar with the faintest hint of delicious vanilla			2
i love the sophisticated tin , too			0
for the price it ’s a real bargain , and at 193 calories per serving , it ’s not too fattening either			0
we say : it ’s very hard to get the flakes to melt , but it ’s worth it — the drink is delicious			0
4/5 @entity144 @entity143 £ 4.99 for 270g , @entity145 @entity7 says : i love the look of the dark chocolate beads			1
but although the 53 per cent cocoa content sounds generous , the beads are virtually 47 per cent sugar ( along with a few other additives )			2
it needs less sugar and more chocolate			2
then it might be drinkable			0
we say : you put three tablespoons of the chocolate beads into 200ml of hot milk and stir vigorously			1
the beads take a long time to dissolve and , even after 60 seconds whisking , we ’re left with lumps still in the chocolate			0
it ’s disappointingly sweet and has a far too large number of calories ( 344 per serving )			0
a couple of sips are enough			0

a *steaming* cup of cocoa is a *surefire* *winner* on a cold *winter* **'s** night
with the help of chocolate expert @entity7 we *'ve* put the best to the test
