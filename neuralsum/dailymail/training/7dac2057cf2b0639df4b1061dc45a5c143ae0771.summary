by @entity0 officials are worried that secondary school children are unable to resist the temptation to snack on junk food fast food takeaways should be banned from near schools in a bid to curb child obesity , the government ’s public health quango has urged			1
@entity12 has brought out tough new guidance for councils , urging planners to refuse permission for burger bars , chip shops and pizza parlours within five minutes ’ walking distance of schools			1
officials are worried that secondary school children , many of whom are allowed to leave school premises at lunch time , are unable to resist the temptation to snack on junk food if it is available nearby			1
the dramatic guidance is designed to turn around the worrying levels of obesity in our society			1
two - thirds of @entity36 adults , one - fifth of children in reception and a third of those in the final year of primary school are obese or overweight			1
last week @entity40 demanded a clampdown on takeaway shops that tempt pupils away at lunchtime			2
the tv chef called for urgent action over the ‘ madness ’ which allows junk food operators to still open up ‘ within spitting distance ’ of some schools			1
in an interview with the @entity52 , mr @entity40 said : ‘ you ca n’t have one arm of the government investing money in food education and school lunches , and then have another part allowing junk food , en masse , to be licensed and given permission to trade within a stone ’s throw of a school on every corner			1
’ research commissioned by @entity12 reveals that takeaways are a much bigger problem in some authorities than others , with a massive disparity across the country in the density of outlets per head of population			1
those with the highest number tend to be in the most deprived areas of the country , with the density varying from 15 takeaways per 100,000 people in the richest areas to 172 in the poorest			0
in turn , poorer people tend to be more unhealthy			0
levels of obesity among the 10 per cent most deprived children in the last year of primary school are double rates among the 10 per cent least deprived			1
the @entity12 report , distributed to all councils , calls on them to use the planning process to ‘ modify the environment ’ in order to prevent easy access to ‘ energy - dense food ’			1
one of the dietary trends in recent years has been an increase in the proportion of food eaten outside the home , which is more likely to be high in calories , said a report by @entity12 it said : ‘ one of the dietary trends in recent years has been an increase in the proportion of food eaten outside the home , which is more likely to be high in calories			1
‘ of particular concern are hot food takeaways , which tend to sell food that is high in fat and salt , and low in fibre , fruit and vegetables			2
’ the report added : ‘ one important action is to modify the environment so that it does not promote sedentary behaviour or provide easy access to energy - dense food			2
‘ the aim is to help make the healthy choice the easy choice via environmental change and action at population and individual levels			2
‘ local authorities have a range of legislative and policy levers at their disposal , alongside wider influences on healthy lifestyles , that can help to create places where people are supported to maintain a healthy weight			0
‘ public health professionals should work with their colleagues across local authorities to use these and other approaches to maximise health benefits			0
last week @entity40 demanded a clampdown on takeaway shops that tempt pupils away at lunchtime ‘ planning authorities can influence the built environment and reduce the extent to which it promotes obesity			2
’ although the @entity12 admits there is little research linking elevated levels of obesity with high concentrations of fast food outlets , it says there is a ‘ theoretical ’ argument that there is likely to be a link			1
it says a priority for councils should be to protect children from the temptation of spending their money in takeaways at lunchtimes or on the way home			2
the 38 - year - old tv chef challenged political parties to make the issue part of their election campaigns ‘ improving the quality of the food environment around schools has the potential to influence children ’s food - purchasing habits , potentially influencing their future diets , ’ the report said			1
‘ however , it is important to note that taking action on hot food takeaways is only part of the solution , as it does not address sweets and other high - calorie food that children can buy in shops near schools			0
’ the report points out that a number of @entity201 boroughs have already brought in bans on takeaways near schools			0
most use a 400 metre exclusion zone , which is equivalent to five minutes ’ walk ; but @entity206 and @entity207 uses a larger zone of 800 metres			0
to ensure such zones avoiding the danger of losing appeals , @entity12 suggests some ways they can strengthen their case			2
‘ many hot food takeaways may generate substantial litter in an area well beyond their immediate vicinity , ’ he said			0
‘ discarded food waste and litter attracts foraging animals and pest species			0
‘ hot food takeaways may reduce the visual appeal of the local environment and generate night - time noise			0
short - term car parking outside takeaways may contribute to traffic congestion			0
‘ improving access to healthier food in deprived communities may contribute to reducing health inequalities			0
’ @entity12 also suggests councils could use street trading legislation to restrict fast food vans from setting up shops near schools			1
@entity240 in @entity201 , for example , has banned ice cream vans near schools and nurseries			0
the report also called for councillors to be appointed as healthy eating czars to liaise between planners and the @entity248 .			0
