@entity8 who admits to himself paying ' a fortune ' in excess baggage , added it was likely that ‘ at some point ’ airlines would start charging even for hand luggage			1

mr @entity8 said that @entity4 had already increased its charge for hold luggage by £ 20 for the summer period to catch out holidaymakers			1
rising prices : @entity4 's @entity8 has revealed the airline will increase its baggage charges until no - one can afford to take luggage for the hold - and it 's already increase its hold luggage charge by £ 20 this summer asked what was the logic behind charging people more for the summer period , he replied : ' that 's when they are likely to bring more bags			1
' mr @entity8 went on : ‘ we will keep increasing charges until we get rid of ( hold ) bags			1
' he said @entity4 had reduced the number of its passengers who checked in hold baggage from 80 per cent to 19 per cent and that this was saving the airline ‘ a fortune in money ’			1
but he accepted that some passengers would always want to bring big bags that needed to go in the hold			1
he said : ‘ we will never get rid of ( hold ) bags but i would be disappointed if we do n't get our figure for ( hold ) bags down from around 20 per cent to 10 per cent			2
’ asked if @entity4 would consider charging for hand luggage , mr @entity8 said : ‘ at some point in the future i think it 's likely that airlines will do it but i ca n't get my head round how you would do it			1
i think it 's unlikely that we will do it			0
’ carry - on only : passengers wait to check - in at the @entity4 desk in @entity61			2
passengers will still be able to bring hold luggage but it will become increasingly expensive as @entity4 tries to reduce the number of hold bags mr @entity8 's airline makes a fortune charging for extras ’ and has even threatened charging passengers to use the toilet and to introduce ‘ standing room ’ style upright seats to boost passenger numbers			1
this week the airline said it had ordered pilots to fly slower – adding two minutes to journeys – to save about £ 70million a year in fuel costs			1
asked if he was considering reducing the amount of air conditioning on his flights , mr @entity8 said : ‘ no. even i would not do that			1
' last year he admitted to @entity84 magazine : ’ of course i fly @entity4 , but it costs me a fortune in excess baggage			2
’ @entity4 also plans to offer advertising space on its planes asked if he would take an advert from low - fare rival airline @entity92 mr @entity8 replied : ' i would take an advert from anyone , even the @entity97 @entity96 ( @entity96 )			1
@entity4 has been battling the @entity96 and other regulatory authorities since 2006 in his efforts to take over @entity101 carrier @entity100			0
budget : a @entity4 jet taking off from @entity61			0
mr @entity8 this week ordered pilots to fly slower , adding two minutes to journeys , to save £ 70million - a - year in fuel costs he said the @entity96 ’s inquiry into the proposed takeover was ‘ misguided ’ and ' a political farce which has no case , no evidence and no credibility either ’			1
@entity4 said that from the end of october it was adding one extra daily flight to its five main @entity101 - @entity97 routes - from @entity116 to @entity61 , to @entity117 , to @entity118 , to @entity119 and to @entity120			0
this is in direct response to similar flight increases recently announced by @entity100			0
cash generated from ‘ extras ’ - known as ‘ ancillary revenue ’ or the industry term for any income that does n’t come from selling seats - was up by 25 per cent to £ 308million			2
this was helped by a boost from extra charges for allocated seating and priority boarding , as well as higher credit card fees			0
the decision to allow passengers to reserve a seat for a higher price echoes rival @entity92 , where the extra option has also proved a success			2
it imposes a £ 70 fine on travellers who forget to print out their boarding passes online – adding hundreds of pounds to the cost of a family holiday for those who fall foul			0
and the cost of changing the name on a ticket is £ 110			0
@entity4 ’s outspoken chief executive mr @entity149 has in the past branded those who do n’t like paying for having their boarding cards printed out as ' idiots ' who should ‘ b * * * * * off ’			0
but the opinionated airline chief has no sympathy for other passengers who fall foul of his tightly drawn rules			2
he criticised @entity161 mother - of - two mrs @entity163 who received backing from nearly half a million @entity165 users when she was forced to pay £ 236 to print boarding passes for her family so they could fly home to @entity97 from @entity169 , @entity170			0
he said : ’ so she gets on ' the @entity171 ' to complain			0
emboldened by the rising tide of support , mrs @entity163 asks for compensation , to which we replied politely but firmly , thank you , mrs @entity163 , but it was your f * * * - up			0
we 're not changing our policy			0
’ three years ago competition watchdogs at the @entity185 accused @entity4 of ‘ puerile , almost childish ’ behaviour in the way it imposed unexpected charges .			0
