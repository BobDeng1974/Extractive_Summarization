a poster encouraging women to travel to @entity2 for breast augmentation surgery has been banned by the advertising watchdog for ' trivialising ' the cosmetic procedure			2
commissioned by the @entity2 - based @entity6 , the offending posters were displayed in public toilets at a number of motorway service stations and shopping centres in the @entity12			1
the pink and white ad states : ' did you know ... " boob job " is the most popular cosmetic procedure for women			0
' the watchdog upheld the complaint as it felt it trivialised breast enhancement surgery by portraying it as a straightforward ' risk - free ' procedure that could be incorporated into a holiday ' @entity2 is proud to be amongst one of the only countries within the region where medical tourism is promoted by the government			1
' the ad goes on to discuss safety standards of the cosmetic surgery industry in @entity2 , before adding , ' our private hospitals bagged 3 out of 9 awards at the international @entity36 2014			2
' but the posters came under the scrutiny of the @entity39 following a complaint by a member of the public that they were socially irresponsible			0
the watchdog upheld the complaint as it felt it trivialised breast enhancement surgery by portraying it as a straightforward ' risk - free ' procedure that could be incorporated into a holiday			1
' we considered that could be interpreted as suggesting that surgery was a decision that could be undertaken lightly , without serious consideration of the nature of the intervention , ' it said			0
' we therefore concluded the overall presentation of the ad was likely to be seen as trivialising breast enhancement surgery			1
' @entity2 has plenty of other assets to draw potential visitors , including gorgeous stretches of beach @entity64 , the media space buyer that booked the ad on behalf of the @entity6 , defended their client , saying the ad : ' had not advertised a holiday due to the absence of pricing , tourist or accommodation information nor did it include an option to sign up for a cosmetic procedure			2
' it claims ' the ad was informative and promoted safety and high standards , demonstrated by examples of internationally recognised awards			0
' however , the @entity39 did n't agree and ruled that the main focus of the poster was medical tourism for breast augmentation , and this emphasis ' was likely to detract from the seriousness of the surgery offered			0
