by @entity0 and @entity1 as if he did n’t already have enough ground to cover , it looks as though @entity4 has gone galactic			0
but wait just a moment … surely there are n’t enough presents for the whole universe on that sleigh ? and where are the rest of the reindeer to help @entity12 ? ah			0
if you look very closely , there are strings attached to this festive scene			0
but there was still a fair bit of @entity25 magic involved in making this flight happen			2
with the elves all busy helping the real @entity4 , it took council worker @entity37 , 26 , and his girlfriend @entity38 to get his miniature counterpart airborne			1
the pair attached a high altitude weather balloon to their model @entity4 , along with a camera and a gps tracker , and watched it rise to dizzying heights			1
the sleigh launched from the @entity48 , @entity49 , and flew to 100,000ft above the @entity22 's surface as it started the journey around the globe			1
but the trip came to a disastrous end when the helium filled balloon - which cost around £ 50 - popped and its passengers started to fall to the ground			0
the flight was made possible by the pair of science fans , who attached him to a high altitude weather balloon			1
mr @entity37 and miss @entity38 also installed a camera which captured incredible views of the planet 's curvature as the they flew			1
a parachute then opened and it slowed down before landing 70 miles away in @entity72			2
miss @entity38 , 27 , said : ' it is a personal project which we have been working on			2
we watched a @entity76 man go into space on @entity78 and thought ' let 's have a go '			2
cloudy : they tried to replicate the journey @entity25 would take on december 24 atmosphere : within two hours of the launch @entity4 and the @entity84 were 100,000ft above the earth 's surface mid-flight problems : his journey came to an end when the high - altitude balloon burst ' we started sending normal cameras into space and , with @entity25 coming up , decided to send @entity4 into sky			1
' we got clearance from the @entity97 and launched on december 1			0
it set off from the @entity48 and about two - and - a - half hours later it landed in @entity72			0
' it reached just short of 100,000ft which is the stratosphere - it is nearly but not quite space			0
we managed to get shots of the curvature of the earth so we were really pleased			0
' scientists : @entity37 and @entity38 bought the helium balloon for £ 50 lift off : they launched the balloon from @entity110 of @entity111 , @entity49 , and it landed 70 miles away in @entity72			1

@entity37 and @entity38 attached @entity21 to a weather balloon
the science fans watched as it reached 100,000ft above the earth 's surface
@entity25 and his trusted reindeer landed 70 miles away from the launch site
