@entity0 finally cut ties with manager @entity2 on monday after a 4 - 0 home defeat by fellow strugglers @entity4 left the @entity6 club just one point above the relegation zone in the @entity9			1
with that in mind , @entity10 have @entity0 fan @entity13 of 90min.com to tell us what he makes of the situation			2
is @entity17 a suitable short - term replacement for @entity2 ? let 's see what he had to say			1
@entity2 's sacking as manager of @entity0 could n't have come soon enough			1
chairman @entity23 took the decision on monday and it 's hard to argue that it was n't the right call			0
the relationship just was n't working , our supporters know it and they did n't hesitate to show the @entity32 their dissatisfaction on a grim afternoon on @entity6 on saturday			0
there 's a better fit out there			0
and while we 've been clamouring for a change at the helm over the course of the last few months , it 's become glaringly obvious that @entity2 himself did n't want to remain in charge either			2
@entity2 's sacking as @entity0 manager could not come soon enough for the struggling club 's fans the relationship between @entity2 , the club 's board and their fans was not working and the move was correct angry @entity0 supporters attempt to confront @entity2 during the 4 - 0 defeat to @entity4 on saturday additionally , @entity54 's moniker of ' head coach ' meant he was not in primary charge of signing players			1
he 'd made it obvious that it was n't something he was comfortable with			0
an unhealthy relationship at the top rolls downwards , as with any business			0
@entity2 's attitude had transcended onto the pitch and it has been having a terrible effect			2
saturday was the cast - iron evidence of that			0
we are just a point above the @entity9 's relegation zone following the home 4 - 0 drubbing to @entity4			1
bear in mind that this was a team with the league 's worst attack and they 'd put four past us before half - time			2
@entity2 's position had become untenable			2
@entity17 comes to the @entity6 club with a wealth of experience from around @entity85 football @entity17 has never managed in @entity86 before but is reportedly in line for a £ 500,000 survival bonus the decision to remove @entity2 does n't reek of desperation , given @entity17 's appointment within 24 hours our situation looks precarious , but it 's worth remembering that it could be far worse			1
it 's the right time for @entity2 to leave			2
something needed to be done before it was too late			0
luckily , we 've not quite reached that stage yet - there 's nine games to save ourselves			2
we 've moved swiftly in hiring a replacement , which is always promising			0
the decision to remove @entity2 does n't exactly reek of desperation , given former @entity104 and @entity105 national coach @entity17 was brought in within 24 hours			1
@entity106 and @entity107 look disconsolate for @entity0 upfront on saturday afternoon one fan roars towards the bench as @entity2 's tenure as manager drew to its inevitable close on saturday another supporter holds up a hand - written sign with the message ' @entity2 out ' - his wish was granted on monday @entity17 has been handed the job on a short - term basis			1
as well as the wealth of managerial experience he brings , the reported £ 500,000 he 'll pocket to avoid relegation is enough of a motivation			0
he 's no spring chicken at 67 , but @entity17 has spoken of his own hunger to prove himself in the @entity9			1
he 's got the knowledge under his belt to do that			0
there 's enough reason for the fans to be confident that we can stay up			1
new managers inevitably inject a shot in the arm to their players in their first few weeks			0
it should be enough to carry us through to the end			0
you only have to look at @entity142 and @entity143 to see the impact that both new managers have had on the teams ' fortunes			0
@entity148 has been touted as a potential replacement after an impressive season with @entity151 @entity152 looks @entity9 - bound either with @entity153 or one of many interested clubs our long - term aspirations may be higher than merely fighting relegation , but it 's now a case of seeing this season out before starting afresh again next term			1
it likely wo n't be @entity17 to take us beyond this summer , but with the likes of @entity148 and @entity152 - who have both had promising seasons at their respective clubs - linked as @entity2 's long - term successor , things are looking up			1
@entity2 had reached the point of no return , so it 's time to start afresh			1
