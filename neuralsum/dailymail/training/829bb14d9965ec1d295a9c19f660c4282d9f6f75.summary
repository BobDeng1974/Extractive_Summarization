the research shows that when it comes to running , women may get more out of high intensity interval training than their male counterparts			1
earlier interval training studies primarily focused on highly trained males , but researchers say that they overlooked the variety of other populations that routinely use interval training			2
drs @entity20 and @entity22 , at @entity23 , @entity24 , at the @entity25 , and dr @entity26 at the @entity27 , put eight men and eight women between the ages of 19 and 30 through self - paced , high intensity interval training using different recovery periods			1
all of them reported at least a moderate fitness level and participation in at least one session of interval training a week			2
participants used a treadmill for six , four - minute intervals performed at the highest intensity they felt they could maintain			0
recovery periods between intervals consisted of one minute , two minute or four minute breaks			0
throughout the intervals , the participants ’ maximum oxygen consumption and heart rates were measured			0
results revealed a significant effect of gender on both percentages			0
across the trials , men self - selected a faster relative pace , but the women worked at a higher percentage of their maximum heart rate than the men , and a higher percentage of their maximum oxygen consumption			0
‘ i think what our data show is that there appear to be meaningful differences in how men and women self - regulate their workouts , ’ dr @entity20 said			0
‘ specifically , in our case , men and women tend to work at the same level of perceived exertion and feel similarly recovered between each interval , however , as they perform the interval runs women tended to work “ harder ” from a relative cardiovascular standpoint than men			2
’ results also confirmed previous findings suggesting that a 2:1 work - to - rest ratio is optimal during @entity78 for both men and women			1
the results also confirmed previous findings suggesting that a 2:1 work - to - rest ratio is optimal during high intensity interval training for both men and women ‘ i really think one of the “ take home ” points from our study was , despite the gender differences that we found , individuals performing high - intensity interval training should listen to , and trust , their body and pay attention to how they are feeling , ’ said dr @entity20			1
‘ without having any feedback about their data , all the participants had to use to set their pace was how they felt during the run and how recovered they felt			0
‘ in that sense , when runners perform high - intensity intervals , trust that if you push yourself to run what you consider hard , you are probably at the correct intensity , and if you maintain recommended work - to - rest ratios you most likely will recover appropriately to get the most out of your workout , independent of gender			1

interval training may be the best way for women to benefit from running
women get more from high intensity interval training than men do
a 2:1 work - to - rest ratio is optimal during @entity78 for both men and women
