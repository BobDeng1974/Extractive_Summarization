it ’s a game that almost every single @entity1 has innocently played – but it ’s an activity that kills within seconds			0
@entity3 is the number one killer of the most competent , fit swimmers – and it affects anyone holding their breath underwater , resulting in death without warning			1
it takes place when the swimmer loses consciousness due to a severe lack of oxygen to the brain			2
it only takes two minutes for death to occur – whereas regular drowning takes six to eight minutes			0
there is a dangerous lack of education and understand about the dangers of breath - holding – a silent killer which is a commonplace activity amongst @entity1 children , elite swimmers and snorkellers , a 60 minutes report investigates			1
in january last year , @entity32 was just 12 years old - a water - loving , fit and competitive swimmer , when he died in his backyard pool in less than one metre of water			1
‘ he just loved being in the pool , ' his mother @entity48 told 60 minutes			1
‘ he ’d just go lap after lap after lap. holding his breath , challenging himself to see how far , how many laps he can do			2
‘ being a typical 12 - year - old , ’ recalled @entity32 ’s mother @entity48 to 60 minutes			1
she had been watching just metres away as he swam , holding his breath as he swam to try and beat his personal best			2
@entity32 's mother @entity58 recalls how she ran to pull her son of the water and started cpr to try and revive @entity32 ms @entity48 's swift response was not enough to save her son from the effects of @entity3 without any warning , he floated to the bottom of the pool and never regained consciousness , despite his mother @entity58 and emergency crew ’s hour - long efforts to resuscitate him			1
his mother had looked away for one to two minutes at most , and ran straight away to her son to drag him out of the pool and commence cpr			2
‘ i would have looked away momentarily , distracted by my baby in my arms , ' said ms @entity48			0
' i looked back and i saw him			0
he was at the shallow end of the pool , in metre - deep water , ' he was just curled in the foetal position at the bottom of the pool			1
’ ms @entity48 's swift response was not enough to save her son from the effects of @entity3			2
‘ i still do n’t accept it , i still do n’t understand it and i ’ll never get over it , ’ @entity84 said of his son 's tragic death ‘ i did everything i could to try and save him and that ’s the hardest thing - in the end i just could n’t , ' said ms @entity48			2
a person on the brink of suffering a @entity3 is totally unaware that they need to take a breath			1
‘ he was at the shallow end of the pool – he could have just stood up but he did n’t get the warning , ’ said @entity32 ’s father , @entity97			1
@entity32 's parents had never heard of @entity102 and are now desperate to inform @entity1 about the deadly risks @entity102 is a little - known condition and often deaths from @entity3 are incorrectly recorded as ‘ drowning ’ on coroner ’s reports – as was @entity32 ’s initially			1
@entity32 's parents had never heard of @entity102 and are now desperate to inform @entity1 about the deadly risks			1
‘ people have known about it since the 1950s , only written about it since 1986 and people have only been listening since 2000			0
it ’s a long haul			0
‘ it commonly affects the very competitive , type a personalities – the person who pushes themselves to the limit			0
‘ so they see how long they can hold their breath for , which is a recipe for disaster , particularly if they do it over and over and over again			2
’ hypoxic drills involve underwater breath - holding and train the body to survive without taking a breath for extensive periods of time @entity32 fit that description , according to his father , who describes his son as ‘ a quiet achiever , he was determined to do his best at anything ’ hypoxic drills involve underwater breath - holding and train the body to survive without taking a breath for extensive periods of time			1
these drills , used by coaches to train elite swimmers and military trainers , can be deadly			1
a shallow blackout almost claimed the life of @entity144 last month in suburban @entity145 , when she instantaneously lost consciousness during a hypoxic training session			0
‘ she sank in the blink of an eye , ’ explained her father , @entity148			0
‘ that image , the little body lifeless next to me			0
’ these drills , used by coaches to train elite swimmers and military trainers , can be deadly but remain a ' daily ' part of swim training the 12 - year - old blacked out and was pulled unconscious from the pool			1
she describes feeling ‘ out of breath ’ and then waking when the oxygen mask was placed on her face			0
‘ we have no scientific evidence to say that breath holding enhances performance			0
we do n’t know of the benefits so why are we doing it ? ’ dr @entity114			0
swimming @entity1 is reportedly aware of the risks but hypoxic drills are still a daily part of swim training , according to 60 minutes			1
‘ i do n’t think @entity178 is encouraging any coach to do hypoxic training , ’ @entity178 head coach @entity177 ‘ these are guidelines to prevent and educate swimmers as much as possible from doing the wrong thing			2
’ the @entity32 family want people to know about the risks so nobody ever has to experience the loss that they have to live with everyday ' @entity190 ' has now been established to try and make a change – to raise awareness and education to save the lives of other children , who would otherwise be unaware of the dangers of @entity197			1
the government commits more than $ 8 million a year to water safety but little is known about the dangers of @entity102			0
