by @entity0 published : 02:53 est , 14 may 2012 updated : 03:38 est , 14 may 2012 hacked : @entity1 is believed to have been targeted by a 17 - year - old heading a group called @entity4 a teenage boy is accused of heading a group of hackers who targeted @entity1 , @entity9 and the @entity10			1
@entity4 claimed responsibility for hacking @entity13 ’s anti-terrorist hotline and posted recordings on @entity15			1
the 17 - year - old was arrested on friday and police seized all of his computer equipment			1
he was released on bail over the weekend			2
he is also accused of hacking @entity21 and @entity23 boss @entity22			1
the teenager , from @entity25 , was back at his parents ' £ 150,000 home yesterday			2
he answered the door to a reporter yesterday and began talking before a woman told him to ' shut the door ' , the @entity28 reported			0
the teenager was held under the @entity33			1
@entity4 has claimed responsibility for more than 1,400 offences - including ' denial of service ' attacks			1
a spokesman for the @entity39 said : ' computer equipment has been seized and is undergoing a detailed forensic examination			1
' the arrest comes after @entity4 claimed it was ' easy ' to bypass @entity13 's security which they said was ' from the 80s '			1
they claim to have accessed a server from @entity47 to record conversations			0
the force launched an investigation after being made aware that the phone calls may have been hacked			0
@entity13 's hotline is understood to have been hit with more than 700 calls before an @entity55 - sounding caller , using the name trick , told them they were being ' pranked '			2
scroll down for audio online presence : this image appears on the website of the @entity39 , urging members of the public to call the confidential anti-terrorist hotline detectives said ' appropriate action would be taken ' after a number of recordings were posted on @entity15			1
in one of the clips , a man identifying himself as @entity69 is heard telling an officer : ' knowledge is power ... we embarrass governments and f * * * the police			0
' ' trick ' is later heard laughing when a woman comes on to the line to tell him that the phone call was being passed on to the @entity83			0
the hackers overwhelmed a computer server used to host sensitive phone calls using a simple computer script to infiltrate the system			0
the ' @entity90 ' phone server was controlled for 24 hours by the anarchist group , @entity4			1
@entity93 phone networks - known as ' phreaking ' , a term which was in use before computer hacking even existed - allows malicious hackers to listen in or send messages to phone users on computerised exchanges			2
' @entity102 ' was a predecessor to today 's hacking - @entity105 co-founder @entity104 was a ' phreaker ' himself in the early seventies			2
nowadays , computerised phone systems mean that hackers can use computer - hacking skills to ' get inside ' phone systems and eavesdrop on calls			2
in another recording , officers appear to be discussing counter-terror operations while @entity4 listens in			1
the group claimed to have then made calls to @entity117 - but it is understood they were in fact picked up by the @entity39 's counter-terrorism command			1
trick said the group bypassed outdated technology and used a server from @entity47 to record conversations			0
a statement from @entity69 read : ' the phone denial of service was done via a custom script for @entity90 which was installed on an overseas server			0
' the conversation was tapped into via a private phreaking method , their phone system is old and we found a way to get in via basic but private phreaking technique			0
' @entity4 said it deluged counter-terrorism officers with phone calls for 24 hours , ensuring no other calls could get through			1
the group claimed its attacks were prompted by a recent decision made by the @entity143 , which allowed @entity146 - linked terror suspects @entity144 and @entity147 to be extradited to @entity55			2
by targeting the phones , the group essentially carried out the telephonic equivalent of a denial - of - service ( @entity151 ) attack - an approach often used by online hackers against @entity156 websites			2
another recording released by the hacktivists allegedly features @entity117 staff discussing the group 's attack			0
hacked : @entity13 launched an investigation after discovering that confidential calls to its anti-terrorist hotline were allegedly recorded by hackers @entity13 's anti-terrorist hotline was set up in 1991 to encourage the public to report possible terrorist activity , and has been the subject of several costly newspaper and radio advertising campaigns			1
a section of the @entity39 's website dedicated to the hotline gives the following advice to users : ' we want you to look out for the unusual – some activity or behaviour which strikes you as not quite right and out of place in your normal day to day lives			1
' you may feel it ’s probably nothing , but unless you trust your instincts and tell us we wo n’t be able to judge whether the information you have is important or not			0
' remember , no piece of information is considered too small or insignificant			0
' our specially trained officers would rather take lots of calls which are made in good faith , but have innocent explanations – rather than not getting any at all			0
' addressing concerns about secrecy , it goes on , ' we know you may have concerns about speaking to the police – possibly because your friends or family may find out			0
' but all information passed to the police is treated in the strictest of confidence			0
it is thoroughly analysed and researched by experienced officers before , and if , any police action is taken			0

@entity4 claimed responsibility for hacking the @entity39 anti-terrorist hotline
boy , 17 , held until @entity33 before being bailed
