by @entity0 our prehistoric ancestors may have had a detailed understanding of plants and their medicinal qualities long before the development of agriculture			1
by extracting chemical compounds and microfossils from calcified dental plaque found on ancient teeth , researchers discovered purple nut sedge - today regarded as a nuisance weed - would have formed an important part of the prehistoric diet			1
they also discovered traces of smoke in the plaque , revealing evidence of early cooking techniques			0
researchers extracted chemical compounds and microfossils from calcified dental plaque found on ancient teeth of a young @entity26 male ( pictured )			1
they found evidence that purple nut sedge , considered a nuisance weed today , would have formed an important part of prehistoric diets crucially , the research , led by the @entity33 and the @entity34 , suggests prehistoric people living in @entity36 may have understood both the nutritional and medicinal qualities of this , and other plants			1
purple nut sedge is officially known as @entity41			1
it is found in @entity43 , southern and central @entity44 , and southern @entity45			0
it is used in @entity48 medicine , and was also used in ancient @entity50 treatments for fevers and digestive system disorders			0
hot ashes created by burning the plant can also be used to treat wounds and bruises			0
modern alternative medicine suggests the plant be used to treat nausea , fever and inflammation			2
the plant has a bitter taste			0
the research was carried out at @entity64 , a prehistoric site on the @entity66 in @entity36			2
it revealed that for at least 7,000 years , beginning before the development of agriculture and continuing after agricultural plants were also available , the people of @entity64 ate the plant purple nut sedge			1
the plant is a good source of carbohydrates and has many useful medicinal and aromatic qualities			2
lead author @entity77 said : ‘ purple nut sedge is today considered to be a scourge in tropical and sub-tropical regions and has been called the world ’s most expensive weed due to the difficulties and high costs of eradication from agricultural areas			1
‘ by extracting material from samples of ancient dental calculus we have found that rather than being a nuisance in the past , its value as a food , and possibly its abundant medicinal qualities were known			1
‘ more recently , it was also used by the ancient @entity97 as perfume and as medicine			0
purple nut sedge ( pictured ) is officially known as @entity41			1
it is found in @entity43 , southern and central @entity44 , and southern @entity45			0
the plant is used in @entity48 medicine for fevers and digestive system disorders			0
hot ashes created by burning the plant can also be used to treat wounds and bruises ‘ we also discovered that these people ate several other plants and we found traces of smoke , evidence for cooking , and for chewing plant fibres to prepare raw materials			2
‘ these small biographical details add to the growing evidence that prehistoric people had a detailed understanding of plants long before the development of agriculture			0
’ @entity64 is a complex of five archaeological sites which lie 15 miles ( 25km ) south of @entity129 ; one of the sites is predominantly a burial ground of @entity135 , @entity136 and later @entity134 age			0
as a multi-period cemetery , it gave the researchers a useful long - term perspective on the material recovered			0
the research was carried out at @entity64 , a prehistoric site on the @entity66 in @entity36 ( pictured )			2
it revealed that for at least 7,000 years , beginning before the development of agriculture and continuing after agricultural plants were also available , the people of @entity64 ate the plant , considered today as a weed the researchers found ingestion of the purple nut sedge in both pre-agricultural and agricultural periods			1
they suggest that the plant ’s ability to inhibit @entity156 - a bacterium which contributes to tooth decay , may have contributed to the unexpectedly low level of cavaties found in the agricultural population			1
dr @entity162 , a @entity163 at the @entity34 ’s @entity165 research facility , conducted the chemical analyses			0
he added : ‘ the evidence for purple nut sedge was very clear in samples from all the time periods we looked at			1
this plant was evidently important to the people of @entity64 , even after agricultural plants had been introduced			2
’ the findings are published in the journal @entity176 .			0

researchers extracted chemical compounds from calcified dental plaque
plaque was found on ancient teeth from the @entity185 region of @entity36
study suggests purple nut sedge was an important part of prehistoric diets
the plant *'s* ability to inhibit @entity156 , a bacterium linked with tooth decay , may have contributed to the unexpectedly low level of *cavities*
it is considered a nuisance weed today , but has many medicinal qualities
