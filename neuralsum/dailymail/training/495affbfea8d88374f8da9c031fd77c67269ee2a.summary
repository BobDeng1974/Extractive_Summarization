@entity0 of @entity1 said white @entity3 students may benefit from larger numbers of students from ethnic minorities cities with large numbers of immigrant children produce better gcse results than the rest of the country because pupils work harder , a study found today			1
white @entity3 pupils make slower progress than pupils from ethnic minorities who tend to be more ambitious and committed to education , according to researchers			1
cities such as @entity22 and @entity23 boast strong academic records because they have high concentrations of ethnic minority pupils			1
@entity1 researchers said the children of immigrants tended to ‘ have greater hopes and expectations of education ’ and were ‘ more likely to be engaged with their school work ’			1
the findings follow claims that @entity3 firms are forced to hire foreign staff because workers here are too lazy			0
a @entity42 company suggested that @entity3 workers were not prepared to stand in a factory for eight to 12 hours and find it easier to live on benefits			0
the firm is recruiting staff from @entity49 to work for sandwich maker @entity50 - which supplies @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 ’s , @entity54 and @entity55 - because it can not find locals willing to do the work			0
the new study aimed to investigate the reasons for rapidly improving gcse grades at @entity22 schools – known as the ‘ @entity22 effect ’			2
politicians of all stripes have leapt on the trend as evidence for the success of a range of education policies			0
but the research found that the success of @entity22 ’s schools can be explained by its diverse ethnic population			1
white @entity3 pupils – who make slower progress than ethnic minority peers – make up just 36 per cent of 15 - year - olds in @entity22 compared to 84 per cent in the rest of @entity78			1
prof @entity0 said that students from ethnic minorities score higher than white @entity3 pupils , file picture professor @entity0 , who carried out the research , said : ‘ we know that ethnic minority pupils score more highly in gcses relative to their prior attainment than white @entity3 pupils			1
‘ @entity22 simply has a lot more of these high - achieving pupils and so has a higher average gcse score than the rest of the country			2
’ the research shows that pupils in @entity22 schools score about eight gcse points more than those in the rest of @entity78 after taking into account their attainment at age 11			2
this means achieving eight cs rather than eight ds or eight as rather than eight bs			0
although less widely heralded , schools in @entity23 also perform particularly well , the research found			2
professor @entity0 added : ‘ my interpretation of these results leads to a focus on pupil aspiration , ambition and engagement			0
‘ there is nothing inherently different in the ability of pupils from different ethnic backgrounds , but the children of relatively recent immigrants typically have greater hopes and expectations of education , and are , on average , more likely to be engaged with their school work			2
’ his report said : ‘ the main point to take is that … being a recent immigrant or being of non-white @entity3 ethnicity has a very substantial positive effect on progress through school			2
’ it added said than many pupils from immigrant families ‘ typically live in more disadvantaged neighbourhoods ’			0
‘ their advantages must be less material than books , educational visits and computers , ’ the paper said			0
‘ it is argued that ethnic minority pupils have greater ambition , aspiration and work harder in school			1
’ professor @entity0 also speculated that the success of high - achieving ethnic minority pupils may rub off on white @entity3 pupils in areas such as @entity22			1
schools in @entity22 and @entity23 were found to be less segregated along race lines than some other cities such as @entity156			1
‘ @entity22 has a right to be pleased with itself in terms of the excellent gcse performance of its pupils			0
these results help to explain the @entity163 but they do not explain it away , ’ said professor @entity0			0
‘ the @entity163 is a very positive thing , and much of the praise for this should be given to the pupils and parents of @entity22 for creating a successful multi-ethnic school system			0
’ he added : ‘ multi-ethnic school systems can be very productive , allowing the ethnic minority pupils to achieve the grades they seek , and ( potentially ) raising the scores of white @entity3 pupils as well			1
‘ in parts of @entity78 where there simply is n’t a large community of recent immigrants , a focus on how to encourage pupils ’ engagement with school , hard work and aspiration may pay strong dividends			0

schools in @entity22 and @entity23 have good results *due* to minority pupils
white @entity3 students make slower progress as they are less ambitious
@entity1 found that ethnic minorities have greater expectations
