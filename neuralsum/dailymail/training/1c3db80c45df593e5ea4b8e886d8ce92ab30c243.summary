by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 5 december 2012 updated : 07:02 est , 5 december 2012 are we alone in the universe ? until now , scientists have thought that our own @entity4 is the only planet that can support life			1
but now scientists at @entity8 who have been studying our ' solar twins ' - stars that have solar systems with planets - say they could be even more habitable than @entity4			2
our solar system : other stars could be like our sun and have planets that could support life geologists and astronomers at @entity8 have teamed up to search for alien life in a new way			1
they looked for the radioactive elements of thorium and uranium			1
more of those elements make the inside of the planet warmer			2
that in turn drives the plate tectonics , or how the separate parts of the earth 's crust move			2
earthquakes are the result of the different plates of the earth 's crust moving and grinding against each other			2
plate tectonics helps maintain water on the surface of the @entity4 , so the existence of plate tectonics is sometimes taken as an indicator of a planet ’s hospitality to life			0
our @entity49 is a star - our closest star			0
@entity4 is about 150million kilometres from the @entity49 of the eight solar twins the @entity8 researchers have studied so far , seven appear to contain much more thorium than our sun — which suggests that any planets orbiting those stars probably contain more thorium , too			0
that means that the interior of those planets are probably warmer than ours			1
our own @entity4 inhabits the ' @entity63 ' - a region of space where the planet is just the right distance from its home star			1
in this habitable zone , the planet is neither too hot nor too cold : it is just right			0
our @entity49 is almost perfectly spherical and consists of hot plasma interwoven with magnetic fields			0
its diameter is about 109 times that of @entity4			0
chemically , about three quarters of the @entity49 's mass consists of hydrogen , while the rest is mostly helium			0
the @entity49 formed about 4.6 billion years ago			0
life is only possible in a small zone around the @entity49 - the ' habitable zone ' or the ' @entity63 '			1
the @entity8 researchers believe that if the planets around the solar twins are warmer than they thought , then we could increase the size of those stars ' goldilocks zones - and make more planets in those distant solar systems more friendly to life			1
' if it turns out that these planets are warmer than we previously thought , then we can effectively increase the size of the habitable zone around these stars by pushing the habitable zone farther from the host star , and consider more of those planets hospitable to microbial life , ' said @entity103 , who presented the results at the @entity106 meeting in @entity107 this week .			1

presence of radioactive elements means other planets could support life
warmer planets mean scientists could extend a star 's ' @entity63 '
