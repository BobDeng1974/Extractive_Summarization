by @entity0 @entity2 legend @entity1 begged a doctor to amputate his legs due to the excruciating pain he felt after retiring in 2005			1
the former striker , who netted 56 times in 78 international caps and terrorised defences in @entity10 for years , suffered terribly from the stress he had put on his body during a 17 - year career			1
@entity1 , who netted a penalty against @entity15 at the @entity16 , was unable to walk and would wet the bed as he could not face dragging himself to the bathroom			1
the now 45 - year - old told @entity52 : ' i left football and overnight i could n’t walk			2
' i wet the bed even though the bathroom was only three metres away			2
it was 4am and i knew if i stood my ankle would kill me			0
' i went to see @entity59 ( an @entity60 specialist ) and told him to cut off my legs			0
he looked at me and told me i was crazy			0
' i could n’t bear it any longer			0
i ca n’t put in to words just how bad the pain was			0
i looked at @entity49 and said , " that ’s my solution "			0
' despite begging doctors to amputate his legs , medical professionals chose to fit screws into one of his legs instead due to the lack of cartilage and tendons			2
goals : @entity1 netted 300 clubs goals during his career , including 207 for @entity10 club @entity44 pain : @entity1 wet the bed after retiring as he could not face the agony of making his way to the bathroom recovery : @entity1 ( left ) no longer suffers from the excruciating pain he did when he originally retired this largely rectified the problem as it prevented bone rubbing on bone , and @entity1 is no longer suffering from the excruciating pain he felt upon retirement			1
@entity1 made 516 career appearances , scoring 300 goals , including 207 for @entity44 during a nine - year spell in @entity96			1
the prolific forward also won the @entity98 in 1990 , as well as @entity10 with @entity45 in 2001			0
inspiration : @entity1 asked the doctor to amputate his legs as he saw @entity50 athlete @entity49 recovery : @entity1 had screws inserted into his legs to stop the bone from rubbing which helped sort the pain			1

@entity1 retired from football in 2005 after *glittering* 17 - year career
after retiring he was unable to walk due to lack of cartilage in his legs
@entity1 wet the bed as he was unable to face pain of walking to bathroom
he *pleaded* with doctor to remove legs so he could be like @entity49
instead he had screws fitted into one of his legs which largely ended pain
former striker netted 56 times in 78 appearances for @entity2
@entity1 also scored 207 goals for @entity44 during nine *seasons* at club
he was also a hero at @entity45 after a move south
