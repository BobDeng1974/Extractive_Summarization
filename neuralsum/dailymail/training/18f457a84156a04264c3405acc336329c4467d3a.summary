@entity35 , 24 , posted the picture of herself with @entity38 , who was born 12 weeks early , on sunday			1
it was visible only to those she had approved as online friends			0
the mother of two was shocked when the site removed it the same day after an anonymous person – presumed to be one of her friends – reported it as offensive @entity35 , like fellow mothers @entity0 , @entity68 , 45 , and supermodels @entity70 , 29 , @entity71 , 31 , and @entity72 , 32 , had posted the picture to social media as a form of celebration			1

' so why the uprooar ? and why do famous mothers seem to illicit such different reactions ? professor @entity131 , a health psychologist specialising in reproductive health at the @entity133 says on the noticeable difference in peoples reactions to celebrities breast feeding : ' we have some very complex views on celebrities in society			1
' it might be that we see these stars as women who show their bodies anyway , whose bodies are somehow already public so it matters less when they show their breast			1
' a lot of the uproar women experience comes down to how much of the breast can be seen			1
it seems to matter an awful lot how much you can see the nipple			0
' it goes to show how we understand the female body ; to show the breast is seen as a sexualised act rather than an act of nourishing an infant			0

but in general it is not regarded as the norm			0
' the norm seems to be to formula feed and there is lost of evidence of women experiencing stigma and negativity - either directly or indirectly - when they breastfeed in public			2
' even in front of other members of their own family inside their own home many mothers experience stigma over feeding			2
' studies suggest that 80 per cent of women give up breastfeeding before they want to and one of the strong reasons why that is that it is stigmatized and indeed sexualised			2
' the breast is still viewed as a sexual organ in the this country rather than a means to give nutrition to infants			0
' professor @entity208 admits that there seems to be a difference in how the public in general views celebrities breastfeeding and their reaction to encountering it in real life			1
' these are highly visible and respected people in the public eye and people look up to them			0
the positive response they get to breastfeeding is well know			2
' it has previously been harnessed for public health campaigns to try and encourage others to keep breastfeeding , and people continue to try and use the effect for good			2
