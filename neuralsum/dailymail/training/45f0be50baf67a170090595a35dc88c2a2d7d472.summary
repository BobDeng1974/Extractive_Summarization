by @entity0 published : 07:46 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 13:17 est , 22 february 2013 dead mice laced with painkillers are set to rain down on @entity3 as scientists attempt to contain two million brown tree snakes which have caused havoc for more than 60 years			1
most of @entity3 's native bird species are extinct because of the snake , which reached the island 's thick jungles as stowaways on @entity14 military ships coming from the @entity15 shortly after @entity16 there are fears that without action the species could spread to @entity21 , more than 3,000 miles away and cause a ' snakes on a plane ' scenario			1
the brown tree snake was brought to @entity3 on @entity14 military ships more than 60 years ago and has wreaked havoc the snakes can climb power poles and wires , causing blackouts , or slither into homes and bite people , including babies ; they use venom on their prey but it is not lethal to humans			1
most of @entity3 's native birds were defenseless against the nocturnal , tree - based predators , and within a few decades of the reptile 's arrival , nearly all of them were wiped out			1
the infestation and the toll it has taken on native wildlife have tarnished @entity3 's image as a tourism haven , though the snakes are rarely seen outside their jungle habitat			1
the solution to this headache , fittingly enough , is acetaminophen , the active ingredient in painkillers including @entity56			0
the @entity14 government will drop dead mice laced with painkillers in an attempt to control and contain the numbers of brown tree snakes			1
agriculture wildlife specialist @entity62 holds a brown tree snake at @entity65 on the island of @entity3 the venom of brown tree snakes is not harmful to humans but they have been known to bite babies in @entity3 @entity70 , assistant state director of @entity14 @entity72 's @entity71 in @entity21 , @entity3 , and the @entity73 , said : ' we are taking this to a new phase			1
there really is no other place in the world with a snake problem like @entity3			2
' acetaminophen , the same drug used in pain killers like @entity56 , will be used to lace the dead mice as bait the strategy takes advantage of the snake 's two big weaknesses			0
unlike most snakes , brown tree snakes are happy to eat prey they did n't kill themselves , and they are highly vulnerable to acetaminophen , which is harmless to humans			1
the upcoming mice drop is targeted to hit snakes near @entity3 's sprawling @entity65 , which is surrounded by heavy foliage and if compromised would offer the snakes a potential ticket off the island			2
using helicopters , the dead neonatal mice will be dropped by hand , one by one			0
@entity14 government scientists have been perfecting the mice - drop strategy for more than a decade with support from the @entity107 and the @entity108			0
to keep the mice bait from dropping all the way to the ground , where it could be eaten by other animals or attract insects as they rot , researchers have developed a flotation device with streamers designed to catch in the branches of the forest foliage , where the snakes live and feed			0
experts say the impact on other species will be minimal , particularly since the snakes have themselves wiped out the birds that might have been most at risk			2
' one concern was that crows may eat mice with the toxicant , ' said @entity132 , of the @entity134 's @entity133			0
' however , there are no longer wild crows on @entity3			2
we will continue to refine methods to increase efficiency and limit any potential non-target hazards			0
' just as the snakes found their way to @entity3 , they could stow away on a ship , or more likely the cargo hold of an airplane , and begin breeding on other islands around the @entity15 or even the @entity14 @entity148			2
it is hoped the mouse bomb will help to contain the species to limit the damage in @entity3 and stop spread to @entity21 the risk of the snakes spreading has officials in @entity21 on edge			1
the islands of @entity21 , like @entity3 , lack the predators that could keep a brown tree snake population in check			1
@entity162 tree snakes are known as an invasive species because of the destruction they cause in their habitat			1
they are native to @entity168 and @entity169 and usually measure around 6ft , but can grow to be 10ft long			0
their appearance varies from a lightly patterned brown to yellowish green or beige with red saddle - shaped blotches they have two fangs at the rear of their mouth containing neutrotoxic and cytotoxic venom , which is not dangerous to humans			0
females produce up to 12 eggs at a time which are just over one inch long			0
native hawaiian birds ' literally do n't know what to do when they see a snake coming , ' said @entity187 , a spokeswoman for the @entity188 on @entity189 , a partnership of @entity21 government agencies and private organizations			2
a 2010 study conducted by the @entity134 found brown tree snakes would cause between $ 593 million and $ 2.14 billion in economic damage each year if they became established in @entity21 like they are on @entity3			1
power outages would cause the most damage , followed by a projected decline in tourism			0
the cost of treating snake bites would account for a small share			0
' once we get snakes here , we 're never going to be able to fix the situation , ' @entity202 said			0
so far , @entity3 's containment seems to be working			2
only a few brown tree snakes have ever been found in @entity21 , and none over the past 17 years			1
' if we continue doing what we are doing , the chance of success is very high , ' @entity70 said			0
' if what we are doing stops , i think the possibility of the snakes getting to @entity21 is inevitable			2
' the mouse drop is set to start in april or may			0
hawaiian officials fear brown tree snakes would cause $ 2billion damage if they travelled 3,000 across the @entity15 @entity162 tree snakes were brought over to @entity3 after @entity16 when they stowed away on @entity14 military ships			1

two million brown tree snakes have made species of wildlife extinct in @entity3
@entity21 officials concerned snakes could travel 3,000 miles and cause havoc
