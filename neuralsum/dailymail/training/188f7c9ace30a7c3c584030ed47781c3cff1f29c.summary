' the study found that 35.1 percent of people with credit records had been reported to collections for debt that averaged $ 5,178 , based on september 2013 records			1
household debt had continued to plummet as @entity4 pay off their credit cards and shrink their mortgages after the recession the study points to a disturbing trend : the share of @entity4 in collections has remained relatively constant , even as the country as a whole has whittled down the size of its credit card debt since the official end of the @entity50 in the middle of 2009			1
as a share of people 's income , credit card debt has reached its lowest level in more than a decade , according to the @entity57			1
