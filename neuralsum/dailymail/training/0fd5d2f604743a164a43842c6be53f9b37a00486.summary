@entity0 penned one of the most beloved children 's series of the 20th century , but her forthcoming autobiography will show devoted @entity6 fans a more realistic , grittier view of frontier living			1
@entity9 : the @entity11 's unedited draft that was written for an adult audience and eventually served as the foundation for the popular series - is slated to be released by the @entity15 nationwide this fall			0
the not - safe - for - children tales include stark scenes of domestic abuse , love triangles gone awry and a man who lit himself on fire while drunk off whiskey			1
the original rough draft has been preserved at the @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38 , for decades but had n't been published			0
the children 's series never presented a romanticized version of life on the prairie - in @entity44 , @entity0 and her sister @entity45 gleefully help dissect the family pig before bouncing its inflated bladder back and forth in the yard			2
but the series also left out or fictionalized scenes that @entity0 deemed unsuitable for kids , including much of the time the family spent in @entity53 , @entity54 , and @entity55 , @entity56 , according to @entity57 , a @entity0 biographer and the lead editor on the autobiography			1

in the hit tv show , the character of @entity0 was played by @entity70 , right @entity9 : the original version of @entity0 's autobiography was likely written in the late 1920s and will finally be published this fall ' so you can read @entity9 as nonfiction rather than fiction and get a better feeling of how the historical @entity0 family really lived , what their relationships were and how they experienced the @entity82 , ' she said			1
@entity0 details a scene from her childhood in @entity53 , in which a neighbor of the @entity86 ' pours kerosene throughout his bedroom , sets it on fire and proceeds to drunkenly drag his wife around by her hair before @entity0 's father - pa in the children 's books - intervenes			1
scenes like that make @entity0 's memoir sound like it 's filled with scandal and mature themes , ' which is n't exactly true either , ' according to @entity100 , an associate professor of mass media at @entity102			2
' it 's just that that first version was blunt , it was honest			0
it was full of the everyday sorts of things that we do n't care to think about when we think about history , ' said @entity100 , who has read the original manuscript and also is writing a book on @entity30			0
' and it 's certainly not the fantasized version we saw on @entity6 the television show			0
' the real - life @entity118 and @entity119 , known as @entity120 in the series : @entity9 includes stark scenes of domestic abuse , love triangles gone awry and a man who lit himself on fire while drunk off whiskey the original manuscript of @entity9 was written on tablet paper with lead pencil @entity0 's story will likely do well in @entity132 , since the author moved to @entity134 in the late 1870s with her family , eventually meeting her future husband there			1
for fans , the autobiography is chance to see from where @entity0 drew her inspiration , said @entity143 , a @entity0 aficionado who published an internationally distributed newsletter for 10 years and now helps manage @entity145 , a conference dedicated to all things @entity0			0
' i am very excited to see people have access to this , because her life story has been pretty muddled because people get mixed up with the tv show and it 's nice to see an interest in people seeing basically what is the primary source ... ' she said			0
the autobiography preserves @entity0 's original rough draft - misspellings , idiosyncrasies and all - but adds extensive annotations			2
@entity6 lovers can learn about the three girls that @entity0 combined to create the @entity166 character , or how extensive the damage was in @entity56 during the grasshopper plague of the 1870s , which forced @entity170 in on @entity171 to set out in search of work			0
' in some ways , i came to think of the annotations in @entity9 as almost an encyclopedia about @entity0 's life and work , ' @entity57 said .			2
