pensioners could be hit by a tax raid to fund @entity3 ’s plans to cut university fees pensioners could be hit by a tax raid to fund @entity3 ’s plans to cut university fees , it emerged last night			1
the @entity10 leader is expected to announce details of the party ’s policy to lower tuition fees from £ 9,000 to £ 6,000 within days , but is yet to agree with shadow chancellor @entity15 on how the £ 2billion scheme could be funded			1
it emerged last night that one option being considered by mr @entity15 is cutting some of the tax breaks handed to people saving for a pension			1
pension tax breaks are worth about £ 24billion in total each year and have already been cut by chancellor @entity23			1
more money could be saved by lowering the £ 40,000 ceiling on the amount savers can put aside each year tax - free or cutting the lifetime tax - free limit of £ 1.25million per pension , the @entity24 reported last night			2
@entity32 weighed into the row yesterday , admitting mr @entity3 ’s policy was not yet finished and insisting @entity10 must say where it will find the money			1
otherwise , he said , it would face a ‘ credibility gap ’ over its plans to cut the deficit			0
the former business secretary , who was in charge of universities in @entity44 ’s government , said it was ‘ inconceivable ’ that @entity10 could cut funding to the sector			0
he told academics and university administrators in @entity50 : ‘ if any reduction in fees is announced , and i ’m not assuming that it will be , it ’s absolutely vital that replacement funding from taxation is identified and announced at the same time			2
‘ not in a generalised way , but in a specific way			0
because that will ensure that no credibility gap is opened up either around university funding or the @entity10 ’s commitment to reducing the fiscal deficit			0
’ he supported @entity64 claims that the rise to £ 9,000 fees had not led to a fall in applications , pointing out that even the poorest students were now more likely to apply			1
@entity32 also said cutting fees for @entity72 students could increase the rate at which universities recruit from abroad to plug the funding gap – potentially ‘ at the expense ’ of home applicants			0
when he campaigned for the @entity10 leadership , mr @entity3 proposed a graduate tax as an alternative to tuition fees			1
but @entity10 is yet to agree on its stance ahead of the election			0
@entity85 dem business secretary @entity84 said cutting fees to £ 6,000 would be ‘ foolish ’ , costing £ 10billion over five years @entity85 dem business secretary @entity84 said cutting fees to £ 6,000 would be ‘ foolish ’ , costing £ 10billion over five years			1
‘ [ it ] would be a populist gesture which would achieve nothing and do a lot of damage , ’ he wrote to mr @entity3			2
critics of cutting fees point out that the benefits would mainly go to the highest - earning graduates as they would end up paying less			0
a @entity10 spokesman said its policy on university fees would be ‘ set out shortly ’			2
n a pact between @entity10 and the @entity103 would be ‘ the ultimate nightmare scenario ’ that could break up @entity72 , @entity101 warned yesterday			0
he accused a ‘ spineless ’ @entity3 of betraying the @entity105 by refusing to rule out a deal with the @entity107 .			0
