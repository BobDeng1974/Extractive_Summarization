barbie dolls are often coming under fire for being an unrealistic portrayal of real women			0
last week graphic artist @entity4 caused a stir online by digitally altering an image of the perfect blonde to illustrate what an unmade - up version might look like , warts and all			1
gone was the smooth skin , silky hair and bright white @entity16 smile , instead this hyperreal version - published with the tagline ' no one is perfect ' - featured under eye bags , yellow teeth , braces , blotchy skin and frizzy hair			1
now one company has claimed that @entity4 's image went too far and have responded with their own rather more gentle idea of what our favourite dolls might look like without the warpaint			1
artist @entity31 has revelaed what dolls would look really like without make - up following the hyperreal @entity16 image that was released last week @entity31 took pictures of the dolls then removed the lipstick , eyeshadow and blusher in a computer image manipulation programme @entity31 says : ' ( the original picture ) got me thinking : is this what @entity16 would really look like without make - up ? @entity45 is a pretty good looking doll			1
so , surely @entity16 without make - up ca n't be too different			2
' artist @entity31 has given @entity16 , as well as her friends @entity49 and @entity50 , a digital make under that reveals a pretty , natural , girl next door look that is a far cry from the original frazzled @entity16			1
the idea is to prove that these ladies - like most girls - do n't really need cosmetics to enhance their looks			0
@entity31 , working with website @entity60 after the site saw a huge spike in ‘ @entity16 discounts ’ searches last week , took pictures of the original dolls then removed the lipstick , eyeshadow and blusher in a computer image manipulation programme			1
@entity31 explains : ' i decided to see what @entity16 ( and other dolls ) really looked like without makeup			1
' ( the original picture ) got me thinking : is this what @entity16 would really look like without make - up ? @entity45 is a pretty good looking doll			2
so , surely @entity16 without make - up ca n't be too different			2
' sure enough , @entity16 still looks pretty , even au naturel			2
' ' the real @entity16 without make - up brings up a new point : if @entity16 can look good without makeup , why does n't @entity82 make dolls with a more natural look ? ' ' the real @entity16 without make - up brings up a new point : if @entity16 can look good without makeup , why does n't @entity82 make dolls with a more natural look ? ' @entity31 's conclusion is that the dolls do not really need to wear cosmetics to enhance their looks since her inception in 1959 , @entity16 - with her perky breasts , flaxen hair , and tiny proportions - has been blamed for instilling a negative body - image in young girls			1
according to the @entity100 , @entity16 even came with a bathroom scale			0
many responses to @entity4 's ' natural ' @entity16 have been negative , however			1
' a doll with an incredibly sick look ? like she 's got an awful hangover or renal failure ? which child would want it ? ' wrote one commenter			0
' i did n't know " natural " meant you looked like you 've been up all night and you smoke crack , ' wrote another			0
and : ' i think i just saw @entity45 running away in horror ! ' one woman , named @entity116 , added : ' i fail to see what 's wrong with admiring beauty			0
even if it 's the beauty of a @entity16			2
why do we need to destroy something that has been an icon for generations ? because some people feel inadequate in comparison ? stop comparing yourself			0
' @entity4 's picture of @entity16 looking less than perfect caused a stir online last week with some critics saying that she looked like she was suffering with liver failure @entity133 , a child and family therapist based in @entity135 , told @entity136 : ' it 's human nature for people to build up iconic figures and then tear them down			1
' we idealize public figures because we want something to aspire to but our standards are impossibly high			0
and when these icons inevitably misstep , we feel disappointed and angry that our hopes have been dashed			0
' she added : ' @entity16 with braces and acne looks very much like the type of women and girls who come into my practice			0
perhaps this new image is a good thing			0
