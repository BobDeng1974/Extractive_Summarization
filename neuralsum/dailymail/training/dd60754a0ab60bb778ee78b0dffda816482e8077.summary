by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:50 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 04:50 est , 4 june 2013 business secretary @entity3 said internet firms had to do more to police what people could search for and view online senior politicians and child welfare campaigners have demanded @entity10 show ‘ moral leadership ’ and block child porn			1
as research revealed one in six men who view the vile sites go on to abuse children , @entity3 last night broke ranks to become the first minister to call on the internet giant to do more to restrict access			2
his intervention came as @entity22 , a leading adviser on online child safety , said there were simple measures that search engines could take to make it harder for paedophiles to find illegal pictures			1
mr @entity22 , of @entity30 on internet safety , said : ‘ if you stop them viewing child porn , you stop much of the physical abuse as a result			1
' @entity10 ’s moral leadership is essential here			1
they are the biggest player in this space in the world			0
' they can and should be proactive – if they did it , i think others would have to follow			0
’ @entity47 , who was jailed for life on thursday , collected a ‘ library ’ of sickening images by searching for simple terms on @entity10 and @entity52 ’s @entity51 in the weeks before he abducted and murdered five - year - old @entity47			1
both he and @entity57 , who murdered 12 - year - old @entity57 , had no previous convictions for sexual offences and progressed from viewing child porn on the internet to committing child murder			1
business secretary mr @entity3 said yesterday : ‘ @entity47 appears to have been influenced by watching child pornography on the internet			1
‘ where there is some scope for taking action is getting the companies that host these sites , @entity10 and the rest of it , to be more proactive in policing what is there			1
’ there was no response from conservative ministers as critics pointed to the party ’s close links with @entity10			2
shadow media minister @entity81 said : ‘ search engines and other technology companies need to be more proactive in preventing access to child pornography			1
the industry should be making safe searches the default			0
if technology companies are unable to make progress by a set date , we need to see action from the government			2
’ @entity96 mp @entity95 , who is @entity97 ’s adviser on parenting and childhood , said : ‘ this is a hugely complex problem and there is no magic bullet , but government , industry and internet users have got to do more to avert more of these terrible crimes			1
jailed : sexual predator and murderer @entity47 is taken from court yesterday to start his whole life sentence in jail however , mr @entity22 claimed search engines were reluctant to act because any access restrictions could lose them millions of users , causing advertising revenue to fall			1
experts say @entity10 can combat abuse by paedophiles by simply popping up messages when users type in search terms such as ‘ teen sex ’ or ‘ barely legal ’ , warning them that they may be about to access illegal material			1
people who view child porn , who thrive on anonymity , may be frightened into going no further , they claim			2
mother and daughter : @entity129 cuddles smiling april tightly			0
she described how the family will never recover from her death mr @entity22 also suggests search engines should reset their default search setting to the safest option , which would automatically block access to all hardcore pornography			1
to view these sites users would have to set up a personal account with @entity10			2
he added : ‘ they could at that point ask them to verify that they are 18 or above			0
that would be a huge deterrent for many of these guys			0
' that would stop them getting on the pathway that led to the child abuse images			2
‘ this is not an attack on free speech , this is not censorship			0
it is about making child pornography less easily available			1
' @entity157 has always been around but @entity10 has made it available on a scale never seen before			2
’ mr @entity22 , who plans to confront @entity10 at a forthcoming meeting and raise the subject at the next gathering of the government ’s internet task force , said while the site does not run adverts from pornographers , bosses may be concerned that blocking porn would mean ‘ people would go to other search engines and this would affect revenue ’			1
he pointed to a @entity175 study from 2007 , which found a ‘ substantial minority ’ of those who watch child porn go on to attack children			2
@entity180 , of @entity181 , analysed 213 online offenders and 191 paedophiles who had physically abused children			0
‘ the majority of people [ who watch child porn ] do n’t appear to escalate their behaviour			0
but a substantial minority do , ’ professor @entity180 said			0
‘ various studies have looked at this and put it somewhere between one in six and one in ten			0
’ over the past month , @entity193 heard how @entity194 murdered april after becoming obsessed with online child porn			0
internet giant : @entity10 says that it operates a ' zero tolerance ' policy towards child porn he found shockingly violent images by searching on @entity10 and @entity51 for simple terms , including : ‘ naked young five - year - old girls ’ , ‘ nudism five - year - old ’ and ‘ pictures of naked virgin teens ’			1
@entity207 , the chairman of the @entity208 home affairs select committee , said online images of child sex abuse needed to be removed			0
@entity213 , who sits on the culture committee , added : ‘ i know it ’s extremely difficult to ban it ( but ) i think with the political will and the technology , if you can do it , we should be doing it			0
’ @entity223 , acting chief executive of the @entity224 , said : ‘ for some time we have been concerned about the growing number of these obscene images which are becoming more easily available and can fuel the fantasies of offenders like @entity194			0
’ @entity10 insisted it does all it can to prevent child pornography coming up on searches , adding that it employs a ‘ zero tolerance policy on child sexual abuse content ’			1
spokesman @entity233 said : ‘ we work with organisations to proactively find this material , so while safe search might filter this out we think it is important to go beyond that and we do that all the time			0
any implication that we do n’t is simply wrong			0
’ asked what they do if they find such sites , he added : ‘ we immediately remove it and report it to appropriate legal authorities			0

business secretary says it is ' very , very difficult ' to police the internet
government web adviser @entity22 says @entity10 as a ' moral ' duty to act
@entity47 had a sickening library of violent child pornography
calls for search sites to crack down on how paedophiles can feed fantasies
