a cargo ship that was stranded for nearly three weeks after it was beached on a sandbank has finally docked after being towed back to port			1
the 51,000 - tonne @entity3 , which is carrying more than £ 30million worth of cargo , was grounded deliberately on a sandbar as it left @entity8 on january 3 after it started listing dangerously in a busy shipping lane with 25 crew aboard			1
the multi-million pound plan to re-right the 15 - year - old ship - which needed to be done before it could be brought back to port - has faced a number of delays caused by heavy winds and stormy weather			1
but today the salvage team working on the ship successfully reduced its listing to five degrees - allowing the @entity22 - registered vessel to be towed back into @entity8 , where it arrived shortly after 5.30pm			1
marketing executive @entity48 , 40 , from @entity8 , left work an hour early so he could watch the @entity3 being towed back in			1
he said : ' it 's great to see it being moved from the @entity52 , especially after nearly three weeks virtually on its side in the water			0
' you could still see a very slight list but other than that it looks like any other ship coming into @entity8			1
' after the vessel beached , the 24 crew members and the pilot were evacuated from the leaning vessel during darkness in a dramatic air and sea rescue operation			0
at the time , 591ft ship was listing at 52 degrees			2
four days later the ship , which sailing to @entity70 , @entity71 , floated free from the sandbank on high tide and has since been anchored at a spot two miles east called @entity75 , near @entity76			1
the 19 - day salvage operation was hampered by heavy winds , which were so strong during one storm that they even caused one of the tugs to collide with the vessel			2
return journey : the 51,000 - tonne @entity3 was towed back to @entity8 today - almost three weeks after it was beached stranded : the vessel , which is carrying more than £ 30million worth of cargo , was grounded deliberately shortly after leaving @entity8 recovery : the multi-million pound salvage mission , which was hampered by heavy winds and stormy weather , was completed today salvaged : onlookers gathered on the seafront in @entity92 , @entity93 , to watch the vessel as it was towed back to port in @entity8 an excavator that was on board shifted during the sailing and punched a hole in the side of the hull , which was quickly repaired			1
but some 3,000 tonnes of water entered the vessel and had to be pumped out and into empty fuel tanks on board			0
it was only then that salvage firm @entity107 was able to complete ballast management and bring the vessel back to a listing of five degrees			2
the condition of the cargo , which includes 1,200 @entity115 and @entity116 vehicles , 65 @entity118 cars and 105 pieces of @entity121 construction equipment , is not clear but further inspections are due now the ship has berthed			0
nearly there : as darkness fell this evning , the ship continued its journey towards @entity8 port , towed by a tug ( pictured right ) new position : four days after beaching the ship , which sailing to @entity70 , @entity71 , floated free from the sandbank on high tide back to shore : tug boats surround the @entity22 - registered vessel as it was brought back to @entity8 port this evening valuable : the condition of the cargo , which includes 1,200 @entity115 and @entity116 vehicles and @entity142 , is not yet clear @entity143 , the secretary of state 's @entity144 ( @entity146 ) , had said the vessel could not be brought back into port until the list had been sufficiently reduced			1
he explained this was to ensure the cargo hold doors could be opened in order for the cars and other vehicles to be discharged when it was brought alongside			0
however , early today it was decided that it was ready to head back to @entity158			2
during its journey , an exclusion zone around the vessel was in place , set at 1,000 metres ahead and behind and 100 metres either side			0
righted : the ship needed to reach a list of five degrees before it could be brought back , so that cargo doors could be open in port operation : salvage crews working in the @entity52 have been removing water from the vessel 's car decks and managing its ballast progress : the ship , pictured on its journey back to @entity158 , docked shortly after 5.30pm - more than an hour ahead of schedule frantic effort : the stricken ship was listing at 52 degrees when it was beached on january 3			1
above , it was towed to an anchor point airspace around the cargo ship was also be restricted to one mile either side of the route as a safety precaution			2
an @entity188 spokeswoman said earlier today : ' the @entity189 is scheduled to arrive at @entity190 in @entity158 at 7pm			0
' during the towing operation to bring the @entity3 in to @entity158 , a restricted airspace ( temporary ) will be placed one mile either side of the navigation route and up to 2,000ft			0
this is designed to provide essential safety during the towing operation			0
' there will also be an exclusion zone around the vessel itself of 3,280ft ahead and behind and 328ft either side			0

@entity3 ran *aground* as it left @entity8 for @entity70 , @entity71 , on january 3 with 25 crew aboard
the 51,000 - tonne ship was steered deliberately towards sandbar after it began to list *severely* shortly after leaving
multi-million pound plan to re-right the ship - which needed to be done before it could be towed - faced major delays
but it has now been towed back to @entity8 after salvage crew achieved necessary five - degree listing today
