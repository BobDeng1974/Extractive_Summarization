by @entity0 @entity1 is desperate for a chance to make @entity4 superstar @entity3 pay for his play - off final heartache			1
the @entity7 defender met up with his international team - mates last week still reflecting upon @entity11 's dramatic @entity10 defeat by @entity12 , in which his late error helped @entity15 to fire @entity16 into the @entity17			1
however , the prospect of playing a part in friendlies against @entity21 in @entity22 during the early hours of saturday morning , and then @entity3 's @entity23 in @entity24 next week , have proved hugely cathartic			1
too late : @entity1 tries in vain to stop @entity15 as @entity12 beat @entity11 in the play - off final heartache : a distraught @entity1 is consoled by manager @entity27 at full - time @entity1 , who will hope to win his fourth senior cap against the @entity30 , said : ' that would be absolutely fantastic			1
he [ @entity3 ] is one of the best players , if not the best player , in the world			1
' it 's a great honour to wear the green jersey and when you play against great opposition , it makes you better			2
' but we are just focusing on trying to get a positive result			2
we had a positive result against @entity42 and we are looking forward to these two games			2
' training has been really sharp , really competitive and i think the boys are ready			2
' @entity1 and @entity11 team - mates @entity47 and @entity49 met up barely 48 hours after suffering play - off heartache , but were immediately enveloped in support from not only their team - mates , but @entity7 manager @entity53 and his assistant @entity54			1
real deal : @entity3 trains with @entity23 ahead of the @entity56 , where he will one of the main stars head boy : @entity1 ( third right ) vies for the ball with @entity61 during @entity7 's game with @entity63 asked about @entity53 's response , the 27 - year - old said : ' he was absolutely fantastic			1
we got in late on the monday and he came and chatted and he just said , " listen , it was unfortunate , what happened , but you have had a fantastic season and in time it will make you a stronger person and a better player "			0
' for someone like that to mention that to me , it meant a lot			0
it gives you a lot of confidence to want to do well and really improve , and i really appreciated it			0
' [ @entity54 ] said some calm words to me and when someone like that says it to you , it 's really fantastic			1
it 's something that again filled me with a lot of confidence			0
' i ca n't thank those two too much , really , for how they have helped me since came in			0
' when he speaks you listen			0
he 's a fantastic guy , he was a fantastic player and when he gives you advice , it 's great for everyone , especially the midfield players			0
' he helps everyone to try to improve their game , so from our point of view , it 's absolutely fantastic and it 's an absolute pleasure to work with him			0
