@entity0 took over for @entity1 at @entity2			1
the @entity4 superstar was left in a daze early on but it had nothing to do with his new multi-coloured boots			2
instead , @entity9 's @entity1 suffered a nasty cut above his eye and was forced to change his shirt barely 15 minutes into the 3 - 0 win over @entity14			1
on 23 minutes , @entity1 peeled away from his marker @entity29 to find space in front of @entity14 's back four			2
the Â£ 60million man then played a sublime exchange with @entity35			0
he expertly trapped the ball sumptuous one - touch control on his right , before splitting the defence with a deft flick with his left to return it into the path of his prolific team - mate , who duly buried it beyond a helpless @entity45			0
but @entity1 was always going to stand out at @entity2 from the moment he stepped on the @entity48 turf			2

it 's not the first time he 's worn a whacky pair of boots either			0
earlier this month against @entity75 , he wore the unique @entity77 signature studs			0
and after his @entity79 heroics in @entity80 last summer , do n't forget is he is the proud owner of the @entity81 ! @entity82 next on @entity35 's hit - list			1
