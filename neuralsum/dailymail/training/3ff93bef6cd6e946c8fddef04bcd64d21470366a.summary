by @entity0 last updated at 1:03 pm on 31st august 2011 a wildfire that sparked in a wooded area forced panicked horse owners to turn their livestock loose as they evacuated the area in @entity7 yesterday			1
before being contained , the raging fire caused swathes of cedar trees to explode into flame as the wind - whipped blaze reached them in the @entity14 of the city			2
@entity7 set a record for the number of days in a year with temperatures above 100 and the near unrelenting heat wave this summer meant conditions were ideal for grass fires			1
fleeing : cattle move to avoid the flames of a large grass fire @entity7 @entity25 , a stable owner in a nearby area , took in horses that had been evacuated while an employee picked up wandering strays to prevent traffic accidents			1
she took in 25 horses as well as 11 dogs and two cats before the fire was eventually contained late on last night			2
she refused to accept payment but was considering taking hay donations			2
she said : ' i 'm just glad i can help			2
that 's what it 's all about , ' evacuated : horses from a miniature horse farm were taken away as wildfires spread southerly winds gusting up to 25 miles per hour along with low humidity and drought conditions made the wildfire difficult to contain and 15 properties were thought to have been destroyed			1
about 200 fire fighters kept the blaze from spreading north to more populated areas while two @entity53 helicopters dumped water on the fire			0
neighbouring cities and counties also sent reinforcements			0
@entity7 fire chief @entity59 said it was crucial to prevent the fire reaching the cedar trees he said : ' they 've got a lot of oil within the tree itself , smoke : a resident watches as the wildfire blazes in @entity7 ' they burn extremely hot and they burn very , very fast			1
a lot of times when it hits those , that 's what really advances the fire			0
' we 're going to be mopping up hotspots for some time			0
' in neighbouring @entity83 yesterday , fire fighters were also using helicopters to battle a blaze that quickly consumed 3,000 acres			0
devastation : the fire destroyed around 15 properties in the area the authorities were evacuating homes along @entity92 , mostly by boat because main roads were cut off			0
' we do not have any confirmed reports of injuries or structure losses , ' most of @entity83 has been under extreme drought for the past 11 months and persistent high temperatures continue to plague most of the state			1
a ban on outdoor burning is in place in 251 of @entity83 ' 254 counties due to the drought .			0
