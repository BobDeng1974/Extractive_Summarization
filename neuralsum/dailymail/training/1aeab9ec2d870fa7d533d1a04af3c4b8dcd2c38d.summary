man and his suit : @entity4 's signature suit style has led him to create a range of men 's clothing called @entity11 mr @entity4 says that when helping design the label , he considered how many men only buy suits for a special occasion , and how their price point is often detrimental to looking good			1

‘ i ’m not a designer , nor do i think i am			0
i see an opportunity to help curate these different pieces for guys at an accessible level , ’ he said			0
