@entity11 's mother and i have never had a proper night 's sleep since @entity11 was taken from us			2
' the wheels of @entity44 justice turn very slowly but we will continue to have faith in the system			0
' @entity2 , 33 , is currently being treated in a secure mental health hospital for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder ( @entity50 ) so he can be extradited to face charges of his new wife ’s murder			1
@entity11 , 28 , was shot when a taxi the couple were travelling in was hijacked in @entity57 township on the outskirts of @entity59 in november 2010			1
@entity2 ’s condition has worsened , making him a ‘ husk of a man ’ , his lawyer @entity60 told @entity64			2
she said : ‘ he can not travel by car as he has a severe reaction , he does n’t want to get into a travelling car or go outside			0
‘ he does n’t even want to go to the shops on his own , ’ she added as the conditions of his bail were discussed			0
‘ in his current state it is unthinkable he would be able to plan any escape , let alone effect one			0
’ the court also heard that @entity2 has flashbacks and remembers the smell of the breath of the man who held a gun to his head before hijacking his car and murdering his bride so vividly that it was ‘ burned into his brain ’			1
honeymoon murder : @entity2 ( pictured with @entity11 on their wedding day in 2010 ) is accused of ordering a cab driver to arrange the shooting death of @entity11 while on honeymoon in @entity59 his extradition to face trial in @entity6 has been halted on the grounds he is suffering severe mental disorders			1
the court heard that he now spends his days sitting in a disused camper van on the grounds of @entity102 , @entity103 where he prays and plays computer games			1
giving evidence , his psychiatrist , dr @entity105 , admitted that @entity2 had ‘ adapted poorly ’ to treatment and is suffering from severe ptsd and moderate depression			1
he said : ‘ his depression has moved into the moderate range , albeit in the lower range of that range in the borderlands between severe and moderate			2
‘ i am clear that his @entity50 remains in the severe range			0
that ptsd has mutated over time and there are different aspects of it that now incapacitate him but the most difficult aspect is his hyper - arousal which make him highly sensitive to noise and now very clearly smell			0
‘ something akin to the smell of the breath of the man that is burned into his brain who was holding a gun , by his account , to his head			0
’ his hyper - sensitivity to both smells and sounds ‘ trigger the re-experiencing of those events in @entity6 , ’ dr @entity105 said the psychiatrist , who is not instructed by either the authorities or the defence , said : ‘ when i say re-experiencing it is not just memory , it is as if he was there , that is how disabling it is			2
’ @entity2 maintains that he is innocent of the allegations and was a victim of the hijacking before he was ordered out of the vehicle which drove off with his bride			2
her body was found in the abandoned vehicle the next day			0
stressed : the court heard today that @entity2 is terrified of car travel and vividly remembers the smell of the breath of the man who hijacked the car			1
he is currently being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder and depression today the judge granted an application by his legal teams to vary his bail conditions so that he could move from @entity102 to @entity168 , also in @entity103 , which has lower levels of security and was described as a more ‘ open , relaxed and calm environment ’			1
@entity172 , representing the @entity6 authorities , said the 32 - year - old does not see himself as a patient at times , that he has fought against treatment and has been aggressive towards staff			2
he also suggested that @entity2 spends his time ‘ in his camper van playing computer games ’			2
@entity2 ’s bail conditions include a £ 250,000 security , which has already been paid , not to leave the mental health hospital where he is required to spend nights without permission and to continue with his treatment			1
@entity2 ’s extradition was ordered in august last year but proceedings were temporarily halted by the @entity191 in march on the grounds it would ‘ unjust and oppressive ’ to extradite him immediately because of his health			1
ms @entity60 said : ‘ we are hoping and believe on the evidence he will recover , in which case he there is no battle at all apart from ensuring appropriate conditions in @entity6			0
’ the legal arguments against his extradition will therefore be whether the conditions in @entity6 are sufficient to ensure he does not relapse into his ‘ severe and disabling mental state ’			1
she added : ‘ at some point he will became fit to plead , he will no longer require medical treatment and all that will be required is some reassurances on the conditions in which he will be held			0
’ @entity2 was arrested in december 2010 and has been held in secure units at @entity102 as part of his bail conditions since in february last year when he took an overdose in an apparent suicide attempt			0
