it was thought that @entity1 was living in a secret location in @entity3 after his 2013 leaks made him a wanted man by the @entity6 – but it seems he ’s actually set up shop in the middle of the @entity10			1
at least , that ’s where the whistleblower is according to @entity14			2
a business called @entity1 ’s @entity16 has appeared in the @entity19 president ’s headquarters thanks to the clever work of security consultant @entity21			1
a business called @entity1 ’s @entity16 has appeared in the @entity19 president ’s headquarters it is thought that @entity1 was living in a secret location in @entity3 nothing happens when the icon for it is clicked , but for a short while it was listed as a snowboard shop , open between 5am and 11pm , according to @entity31			1
several reviews appeared underneath the listing , including one which gave it a five star rating and described it as a ‘ great source of classified information ’			1
mr @entity21 , from @entity40 , told @entity41 that he created the fake listing during a @entity43 in @entity44 to demonstrate a flaw in @entity14 that could be exploited to cause more serious problems			0
he said : ' the point was to demonstrate how a year ago , i 'd shown the same type of flaw on @entity14 and they have not fixed it			0
i wanted wanted to show it 's still broken , in a funny way			0
' and anyone could do this without any special equipment or code			0
' it follows claims that at least three terror groups plotting attacks against @entity62 have changed their communication methods since the leaks by @entity1			1
the @entity66 - linked networks have altered their tactics since the fugitive stole intelligence files from @entity70 and the @entity71 , according to a report			0
extremist websites have also moved to protect their digital communications by releasing encryption programmes for followers , making it harder for extremists to be tracked down			0
evidence of the harm done to intelligence agencies across the world after the former @entity84 contractor leaked 1.7million classified documents in 2013 is compiled in the first comprehensive public analysis of the leaks by the @entity89 security think - tank			0
the @entity1 files revealed details about covert attempts by agencies to view citizens ' private information by gathering internet histories , emails , text and call records and passwords			1
now the @entity89 has found that at least three @entity66 affiliates are known to have altered their communications			0
the think - tank has also found other groups using human couriers instead of email and mobile phones			0
@entity1 is being ‘ exploited ’ under a deal he made with the @entity3 to guarantee him asylum , a leading spy analyst has claimed			1
mr @entity1 may have been told not to speak out on @entity3 surveillance but continue attacking @entity19 in order to save himself from jail in the @entity19 , @entity112 said			1
he accused the former @entity19 spy of not being ‘ transparent ’ and said he was being ‘ secretive ’ about his arrangements with the @entity3 authorities			2
after mr @entity1 , 31 , revealed himself in june 2013 as the civilian @entity84 worker who stole a vast tranche of classified documents , he fled to @entity122 and then @entity3 where he was given asylum			1
the decision by @entity3 president @entity125 was seen as a snub to @entity19 president @entity127 at a time when relations between the two countries are strained			1
but the details of the arrangement have never been made public , and mr @entity1 has never addressed them			2
mr @entity112 , who runs a website which is an online watchdog of mr @entity125 ’s intelligence agencies , spoke out in an interview with the @entity137 , a @entity19 news and culture website			0
mr @entity112 is also an author , investigative journalist and analyst who has been working on the @entity3 security state for a decade			2
he said : ‘ i think there is some sort of a deal with the @entity3 authorities			2
‘ it seems @entity1 insisted that he ’d never be used by @entity3 propaganda			1
‘ he never made it onto ( @entity3 tv station ) rt or other state media outlets and of course they would be happy to have him			2
‘ he ’s clearly being exploited - after all , many repressive measures on the internet in @entity3 were presented to @entity3 as a response to @entity1 ’s revelations			1
’ mr @entity1 is still a wanted man in the @entity19 where , if he returns , he will face espionage charges that could see him jailed for life if convicted			2
the @entity10 is one of the most heavily guarded buildings in the world jihadist websites also released three ' significant ' encryption programmes ' within a three - to five - month time frame of the leaks ' , meaning fanatics are harder to detect and encrypted emails take longer to decipher			0
report author @entity170 said : ' the focus has been about the so - called mass surveillance by @entity70 and the @entity71 but these leaks have allowed extremist groups and jihadists to look at our capabilities – what we can and ca n't do – which has given them a great insight			0
' at a time when the range of threats against the @entity184 has never been greater , with @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity66 in @entity189 , it is astonishing the focus has been more on the shortcomings of our intelligence agencies and not the fact @entity1 has helped terror suspects drop off the radar			1
' he has caused severe damage to our ability to fight extremism			0
' @entity200 director general @entity199 has called the traitor 's actions a ' gift to terrorists ' .			0
