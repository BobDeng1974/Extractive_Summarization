it was almost the perfect start			0
a pinpoint cross from @entity2 , movement to win a free header … and straight into @entity6 ’ arms			2
again within the first 15 minutes , @entity8 found himself with the goal at his mercy , but his heading was found wanting for a second time , the ball directed tamely wide			2
a dream debut duo it may not have been , but in those chances alone @entity8 showed he ’s more than capable of fitting into @entity17 ’ attack			1
the relationship between @entity28 ’s front three of @entity8 , @entity2 and @entity23 is in its infancy , but the plan is clear to see			1
@entity8 runs through the middle , holding the ball up and driving attacking moves forward , with the more nimble @entity38 duo dovetailing either side			0
the @entity40 showed he is more than up to that challenge , with possibly his most impressive moment in the first half being holding off the not - inconsiderable @entity44 just inside @entity28 ’s half before sprinting past the @entity25 defender with a trademark change of pace			1
it was a 20 seconds that typified his performance , with the end shot bobbling wide of a goal shorn of the onrushing @entity6			0
the stroke of half - time saw the striker in tune with @entity28 ’s style yet again , working a training ground corner routine perfectly before lashing @entity21 ’s delivery over the bar			1
there were no histrionics , either , when @entity65 unleashed a challenge best described as ‘ lively ’ after the @entity67 had chased a lost ball down on the flank			0
down on his luck : @entity8 rues a missed chance but showed he is capable of enhancing @entity28 's system @entity73 : @entity8 jets through @entity25 's @entity75 ( left ) and @entity65 in an impressive display getting stuck in : @entity8 challenges @entity25 midfielder @entity77 as he showed off his physicality after recovering from the sliding tackle , @entity8 made no mention of the @entity82 ’s ludicrous decision not to award a free - kick			1
it ’s early days but @entity17 will be hoping he keeps that cool head			0
winning those headers and pulling defenders out of the way offers @entity17 a weapon he did n't have at his disposal last season			0
@entity92 was a tour de force of attacking prowess - and will be for @entity95 - but was n't a target man in the same way @entity8 is			2
@entity92 would interlink with @entity23 and @entity2 to create last season 's potent , free - flowing mix of piercing attack and speed			1
with @entity8 , none of the speed and threat is diminished , but it adds a real focal point , a solid presence in the middle of the attack for his @entity38 partners in crime to play off			0
signing off : @entity8 came off for fellow new boy @entity111 after the hour mark @entity113 : @entity8 's heat map from his hour on the pitch shows him getting the ball in all areas that 's not to say the @entity67 's movement was static - far from it			1
his heat map from his hour on the pitch before being replaced by @entity111 shows touches from all over the pitch			0
he can be a crucial component of the lightning - quick @entity28 , adding power , menace and thought to an attack admired by all last season			2
his holding up of the ball and early understanding with @entity2 and @entity23 had all the hallmarks of being £ 16million well gambled			1
if only he 'd bought his shooting boots .			0

@entity8 made his debut for @entity28 in 3 - 0 win at @entity25
@entity67 striker missed a couple of chances to open his account
showed good understanding with @entity2 and @entity23
@entity28 won thanks to @entity2 , @entity21 and @entity148
