ouch : the winger was injured during a tackle from @entity67 during a @entity9 warm - up match @entity69 kept him in the squad but a setback ahead of @entity20 ’s final game , against @entity73 , dashed all hope of featuring in the tournament			1
‘ it was a great experience to be at a @entity9 , ’ he said			1
