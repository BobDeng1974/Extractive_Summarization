by @entity0 published : 20:14 est , 4 december 2013 updated : 20:14 est , 4 december 2013 @entity1 was yesterday accused of a betrayal on gambling reminiscent of his u-turn on tuition fees as @entity5 refused to act to curb fixed odds betting machines			1
the deputy prime minister had posed for pictures in march alongside campaigners trying to reduce the stakes and payouts on the machines where punters can lose £ 100 every 20 seconds			1
they have been dubbed the crack cocaine of the high street			0
but last night mr @entity1 and senior @entity5 colleagues backed a government plan to keep the stakes and payouts of up to £ 500 the same			1
@entity1 with a betting curb campaigner in march but he has refused to act to curb fixed odds betting machines @entity24 had joined forces with the @entity26 ( fixed odds betting terminals ) group and the @entity29 to force a vote and urge mps to throw out the plans			1
mps voted by 322 to 231 , a majority of 91 , to approve a report by the @entity36 which claimed there was no need to reduce the current maximum stake from £ 100			1
campaigners want to reduce the maximum bet on the machines to just £ 2 in a bid to rein in high stakes gambling in bookmakers , who are allowed four terminals in each shop			1
@entity51 mp @entity50 , who is campaigning to cut the stakes and prizes , said the behaviour of the @entity5 was reminiscent of their willingness to be pictured signing a pledge not to increase university tuition fees – only to renege on that promise in government			1
the @entity61 published details yesterday of a report by the @entity65 watchdog which showed that profits have risen by approaching 50 per cent over four years on gambling machines in bookmakers			2
@entity50 , who is campaigning to cut the stakes and prizes , likened the behaviour to the @entity71 on increasing university tuition fees bookmakers dispute figures supplied by the @entity26 the @entity76 campaign that a total of £ 46billion is gambled on the machines each year			1
but they admit that the fixed odds machines yield profits of more than £ 1billion a year			2
last night @entity82 , chief executive of the @entity83 , said : ‘ problem gambling in the @entity85 , by international comparisons , is very low			0
but one problem gambler is one too many for our industry and we are always looking at ways to increase player protection			0
‘ it ’s why we introduced a new code of conduct recently which included a range of new measures to ensure responsible gambling			0
these include both voluntary limits and mandatory alerts on both time and money spent on a machine			0
‘ we believe a reduction in the maximum stake to £ 2 would have very little , if any impact on problem or illegal gambling but would devastate an industry which provides thousands of jobs up and down the country			2
‘ we remain determined to do all we can to help the @entity112 and society tackle problem gambling			0
that is why we are devoting a significant amount of time , money and energy into addressing these concerns			0
we absolutely understand the responsibility on the industry to do everything it can to protect our customers			0
’ a @entity125 source said the government would act ‘ if there is evidence of harm ’ .			2
