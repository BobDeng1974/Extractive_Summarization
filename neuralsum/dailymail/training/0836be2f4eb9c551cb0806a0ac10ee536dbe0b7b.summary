re-live all the drama here @entity1 has taken to @entity2 to welcome his @entity6 team - mate and new @entity5 signing @entity3 to the team			1
@entity3 sealed a £ 16million move from @entity9 to @entity5 in the closing hours of transfer deadline day on monday and @entity1 seems delighted to have ' another @entity13 lad ' in the @entity15 squad			1
he wrote : ' big welcome to my boy @entity17 ...			0
great player for a great club ! another @entity13 lad ! # gooner '			0
@entity3 , told he could leave @entity62 after failing to impress @entity63 since the @entity65 ’s arrival this summer , was originally offered on a season long loan deal for a bargain £ 3m			0
but the 23 - year - old was determined to force a permanent move to give himself a fresh start and that helped @entity5 force down @entity9 ’s original £ 18m asking price before settling a five - year contract for the player			1
out of favour : @entity9 boss @entity63 allowed @entity3 to leave the club after signing @entity78 return : @entity3 has scored 20 league goals for @entity9 in 90 appearances since 2008 @entity48 had several times claimed he was n’t in the market for a new striker , despite losing last season ’s top scorer @entity84 until after @entity86 through injury			1
but that emerged as a smokescreen as he made failed overtures for first @entity91 then @entity78 , before turning his attention to @entity3			2
and with @entity94 put off by the size of the numbers involved , @entity5 officials worked late into the night to complete the formalities			2
@entity98 was one of several @entity5 stars to tweet their delight at @entity3 's signing , saying : ' i 'm glad to welcome you , @entity104 ! wish you as much goals as possible ! # @entity107 # @entity106 '			2
fresh start : @entity3 has enjoyed previous loan spells with @entity110 and @entity111 @entity48 has long been an admirer of @entity3 and has considered a move for him in the past , but he had always viewed the @entity9 man as a player who is best suited to playing on the flanks , posing a goal threat from wide			1
@entity118 can reveal that @entity48 originally had @entity3 earmarked as a possible replacement for @entity120 , who was set to leave @entity5 earlier this summer			1
but with the @entity15 so short of striking options following @entity84 ’s serious ankle injury , the @entity121 forward will be asked to play in a central role			0
@entity3 , who has 26 caps for @entity6 at the age of 23 , has eight international goals			0
he has scored 20 league goals in 90 appearances for @entity9 since 2008			0
goals : @entity78 has been prolific throughout his career , earning several big money moves			0
