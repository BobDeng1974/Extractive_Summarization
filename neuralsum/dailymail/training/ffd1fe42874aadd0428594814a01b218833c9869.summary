by @entity0 follow @ @ petejenson @entity2 's new coach @entity1 has told supporters it will not be a ‘ tragedy ’ if @entity4 misses the start of the season			1
the club ’s lawyers are hoping that @entity10 will allow them to make a ‘ fast - track ’ appeal to the @entity12 in @entity13 ( @entity14 ) in @entity15 in a bid to lift the ban on the player training with his new team - mates			1
it ’s not ideal but it does not serve as any excuse			2
another player will take his place with the @entity2 badge on his shirt and represent the club			1
' the ideal situation is to have all the players at my disposal but we knew that he ( @entity4 ) could n’t train for four months when we signed him			1
the season is very long and there will be time for all players to play			2
' asked if the club had compromised its ‘ more than a club ’ slogan by signing a player banned by @entity51 director @entity22 said : ' the philosophy has never been about us claiming to be perfect			2
' we accept human beings with all their imperfections			0
people get things right and they get things wrong and they can then have the capacity to learn from mistakes			0
standing firm : former @entity63 and @entity64 goalkeeper @entity62 defended the signing of @entity4 ' in the history of this club we have had some good days and some bad days			1
what we have always done is learn from our mistakes and turn them into positives			0
i am sure that @entity4 will be a positive force for this club in the future			1
' @entity2 ’s situation is a delicate one because they can only use the fast - track appeal process with @entity14 if @entity10 allow them to			1
if @entity10 turn them down they would be forced into a much longer appeal process or have to seek redress in another court			1
@entity22 said : ' our lawyers tell us that we have to be very prudent in what we say about the matter			2
we have to give them time to mount the best case before we say any more about the issue			0
' lawyers working on behalf of the player are hopeful that the independent committee that banned @entity4 from all football - related activity for four months went beyond the limits of its jurisdiction prohibiting him from working for his new employer			1
new chapter : @entity1 embarks on his first season as @entity63 manager after succeeding @entity102 they will also argue that because the player will need time after his four - month ban from training with team - mates to have a pre-season , the ban effectively becomes much longer and therefore punishes the player and the club more			1
in his first press conference since @entity2 ’s return to training the @entity22 also said that the futures of both @entity115 and @entity116 remained up in the air and defended himself against criticism that he had dragged his feet over signing a new centre - back			1
@entity2 have now gone five years without bringing in a new defender missing out on the likes of @entity123 , @entity124 and most recently @entity4 along the way			1
but @entity22 said : ' we are working to strengthen the centre of defence – but so are 90 percent of @entity130 ’s top clubs			0
@entity4 has been the only big movement in the market in this position so far but nothing else has happened			1
we have to look for players who are better than the ones we have			0
' midfielder @entity115 is due back in training on july 24 just before the club spend five days at the @entity140 ’s @entity139 ’s park			2
and defender @entity116 is due back in training on august 5 and both player ’s future are uncertain			2
infamous moment : @entity4 feigns injury after biting @entity147 defender @entity146 last month @entity63 confirm @entity4 deal is done @entity1 said : ' i love @entity115 , i ’ve spoken to him and if he continues here then great			1
' while @entity22 added : ' @entity116 is one of ours			0
we will talk to him and see where we end up			0
@entity115 and @entity116 have a contract but they have also earned the right to talk openly about their future and find the best solution for them			0
' ahead of his first pre-season as coach the @entity2 first team @entity1 was asked about the form of @entity162 and a squad that last season looked bereft of leaders			2
he said : ' i do n’t think @entity162 is below par. we ’ve got a good group here and among them is the best player in the world			0
you ca n’t choose leaders			0
i ’m the leader of this team and i ’m sure from my team other leaders will stand up			0
' he also said that the signing of @entity4 when he already has @entity179 and @entity162 was a plus and not a problem			2
he said : ' the better the players they give me the better it is for me			0
i ’m delighted to have them but do n’t forget about @entity186 and @entity187 and the other players that we can play in attack			0
it ’s not just about those three			0
