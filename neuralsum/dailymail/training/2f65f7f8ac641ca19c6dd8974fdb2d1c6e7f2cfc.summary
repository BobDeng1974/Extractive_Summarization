by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:14 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:54 est , 17 december 2013 it 's the most festive drink on the @entity5 circuit , but would n't leave very many people feeling merry if it always came with a £ 50 price tag			2
but that 's what you 'll be expected to fork out if you order a glass of mulled wine from the barkeep at @entity15 in @entity16 , west @entity17 , this year			1
the @entity18 , marketed as the world 's most expensive , has been crafted by @entity21 's award - winning mixologist @entity20 , and the alcoholic base of this winter special is a 2008 @entity23 and the prize - winning 18 - year - old @entity25 whisky			1
the £ 50 mulled wine is made with the usual spices , plus tonka berries and saffron , which is worth more by weight than gold @entity33 , left , and tonka beans , right , provide some of the depth of flavour in @entity21 's pricey mulled wine along with familiar mulling spices such as cloves , bay leaves and cinnamon sticks , @entity20 has combined the more exotic luxury flavours of @entity45 goji berries , anisette balls , tonka beans and saffron , which is renowned for being worth more than gold			1
finishing the tipple off is a glug of organic @entity52 apple juice , made fresh from seasonal ingredients selected each morning from @entity54			2
@entity20 said : ' the @entity23 , @entity55 , is 62 per cent cabernet sauvignon , 38 per cent @entity56 , which make it ideally suited to combine with heady spices such as saffron , anisette , @entity61 beans , cloves , cinnamon sticks and bay leafs			1
' the spices help to explore the aromas of the wine and bring out its magnificent flavours , while the antioxidants of the @entity72 help to balance the acidity from the spices			2
' in particular , the perfumed fragrance of the tonka beans lends a rich vanilla aroma , which is enhanced by the depth of the saffron strands and the liquorish notes of the anisette balls			2
' the final touch is the award winning @entity25 18 years old , which brings a special scent and strength to this luxurious concoction			1
' the @entity16 mulled wine is being sold at @entity89 in central @entity17 and features on their @entity91 menu the @entity16 mulled wine is available now until the 2nd march , and will also feature on the @entity15 courtyard ’s @entity91 menu			1
hush bar is owned by @entity96 and co-owned by @entity99 ' @entity98 ' @entity97 and @entity100 , owner of the @entity101 and the @entity102			0
@entity105 , creator of the award - winning @entity106 , mother of five , organic farmer and founder of @entity105 , writes about the health benefits of red wine and shares her favourite recipe for mulled wine : @entity105 ' the benefits of red wine have been widely publicised in recent years , with most scientists agreeing that , when drunk in moderation , it may help protect the heart , prevent blood clots and strokes , and even ward off certain cancers including colon and prostate			1
a glass of red wine contains high amounts of natural polyphenols or antioxidants which not only help our cells fight against free radical damage but also increase our levels of ' good ' cholesterol			2
' it also contains procyanidins which help reduce blood pressure and protect against hardening of the arteries			0
studies have shown that red wine may boost brain power too , especially for older women , although the jury ’s out as to whether this benefit comes solely from wine or includes other alcohol			0
do n’t forget , it ’s only a glass or two that may keep the doctor away , not a whole bottle ! ! if you ’re in need of a little seasonal cheer , why not enjoy a glass of delicious mulled wine			1
adding spices such as cinnamon , cloves and star anise also boosts our antioxidant levels			0
this is my personal favourite recipe which will be served to guests at an upcoming candlelit carol concert in aid of my charity , @entity164			0
a heart - healthy winter warmer ! @entity105 's marvellous mulled wine ... and it 's good for you ingredients : use the below as a guideline , but feel free to add your own additional spices such as vanilla and cardamom			1
2 oranges , organic ( or well scrubbed ) peel of 1 lemon ( organic , un-waxed or well scrubbed ) 100g caster sugar a generous pinch of freshly grated nutmeg 3 sticks cinnamon 6 cloves , plus extra for garnish 2 fresh bay leaves 2 bottles of fruity inexpensive red wine , preferably organic 500 ml water 5 star anise method : @entity191 and juice one orange into a large saucepan along with the lemon peel , sugar and all the spices apart from the star anise			0
add just enough water or a little wine to cover the sugar , then simmer gently until the sugar has dissolved			0
bring to boil for a few minutes to infuse the spices until you have a sticky syrup			0
then add the bottles of wine and star anise to the pan and heat gently until warm			0
be careful not to let the mulled wine boil at this stage otherwise the alcohol will burn off , together with many of the healthy benefits of red wine ! ladle into glasses and decorate with a wedge of orange ( studded with a few extra cloves if you wish )			1
to make a less alcoholic version , simply add a little more orange juice and water			0
for a non-alcoholic version , replace the red wine with cranberry juice			0
