by @entity1 correspondent published : 11:54 est , 27 october 2013 updated : 21:00 est , 27 october 2013 a truly seven - day @entity2 is a step closer after doctors ’ leaders softened their opposition to supermarket - style opening hours			1
after months of opposition to calls for seven - day services , the @entity8 has agreed the quality of care provided in hospitals at the weekend needs to be improved			1
this removes one of the main obstacles to a seven - day @entity2			2
the @entity8 is now backing plans for a seven - day @entity2 service despite gps opposing the idea when it was first announced sir @entity22 , the @entity2 ’s medical director , has said it is no longer acceptable for hospitals and @entity20 ’ surgeries to operate for the convenience of their staff at the expense of patients			1
he wants the @entity2 to learn from private companies such as @entity32 and make clinics and same - day operations available seven - days a week			2
just a few months ago the @entity8 declared supermarket - style healthcare was ‘ ridiculous ’ and ‘ utter folly ’ , the doctors ’ trade union has now conceded that consultants should spend more time on the wards out - of - hours			2
senior doctors have been accused of merely popping into hospitals at weekends , leaving patients in the care of less - experienced staff			0
the @entity46 recently revealed that just five @entity2 trusts in @entity48 employ a consultant to work in @entity50 overnight – even though thousands of patients turn up during these hours			0
sir @entity22 , @entity48 's medical director , talked of clinicians who want to ' solve the problem ' although most of the other hospitals have an ‘ on - call ’ consultant , junior staff are often reluctant to trouble them			0
in a newly published position paper on seven - day services , the @entity8 acknowledges that studies show death rates are higher among patients admitted to hospital at the weekend			1
it also notes that an inquiry into the @entity66 , where up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died unnecessarily in one of the worst hospital scandals in living memory , found that patients felt vulnerable at the weekend			0
the statement says : ‘ improving care quality for patients means more staff , especially senior doctors , on site at weekend and evenings			0
’ @entity8 chairman dr @entity79 denied the organisation had made a ‘ damascene conversion ’ and added : ‘ patients should have greater access to high - quality care throughout the week and doctors should be part of the solution			1
’ however the @entity8 has far from made a complete u-turn , as it is still refusing to support proposals for full supermarket - style opening hours			0
the @entity8 ’s support is seen as vital in instigating any changes and it insists financial pressures necessitate that any extra weekend work should focus on only the most seriously ill patients .			1

@entity8 has changed its position to support plans for seven - day service
doctors say patients should have access to weekend care , but warn there is ' much work to be done '
chairman says *council* is ' already in talks with *government* ' on how to *implement* plans
