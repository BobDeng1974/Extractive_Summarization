by @entity0 last updated at 11:48 pm on 20th february 2012 the @entity1 tells a fictional tale about the downfall of a hedge fund and the wealthy family that owns it during @entity8 's 2008 meltdown , but many aspects of the novel are drawn straight from author @entity12 's reality			1
as a former @entity15 analyst and bankruptcy attorney at a white - shoe law firm in @entity18 , @entity13 knew that the twists and turns that led to many a @entity8 fiasco could make for a fascinating story			0
' it 's easy to see finance as something that happens in a conference room , but white - collar crime is fascinating , ' she said			0
recent history : former @entity15 analyst @entity30 has based her new novel , @entity1 , on a hedge fund during the financial crisis in 2008 ' no one 's dying or no cars are blowing up , but it 's incredibly fast - paced and interesting and complex			1
' the @entity1 , which is released in the @entity37 today , is one of the first works of fiction centered on the events of the 2008 financial crisis			1
the book begins with an apparent suicide , which sets off a series of investigations and cover - ups by a web of characters that includes lawyers , financiers , government officials and journalists			0
the dynamics and loyalties of the blue - blooded @entity57 family that runs the hedge fund , founded by patriarch and billionaire @entity61 , are also thrown into tumult as the foundation of the family 's wealth and status is threatened			1
ms @entity12 , 31 , knows a thing or two about family businesses : her family founded prominent @entity18 investment firm @entity70			1
' i grew up going to my dad 's office , and family dinners were filled with chatter about work life ' in addition to her professional experience , she said that she also drew on her family background to write the book			2
' i grew up going to my dad 's office , and family dinners were filled with chatter about work life , ' she explained			0
' one of the things i tried to draw from in @entity1 was the sense that the whole family was involved in the business , and the demise of the business in their case was really like the demise of the family as a whole			2
' as ms @entity12 tried to make sense of the corporate scandals she witnessed as an attorney , she found that chalking up bad behaviour to mere greed did n't quite get to the root of such scandals			2
tale of lost fortunes : ms @entity12 's book is released in the @entity37 today as she pondered what could drive some investors to such extreme corruption , she found her thoughts circling back to family loyalties			1
' one of the fun parts of writing the book for me was trying to get into the minds of people who caused huge amounts of damage professionally , and try to understand what their motivations were for the way they acted , ' she said			0
the urge to protect and provide for children , parents , and spouses factor powerfully into the professional decisions of all characters in @entity1 , from ceo @entity61 to whistle - blowing secretary , @entity130			2
' i had deep affection for all my characters , and did n't like to see anyone as purely bad or purely good , ' she said			0
' people act well , and people act badly , and they 're all doing it for the best interest of their families			0
' ms @entity12 said that another element in the collapse of firms such as @entity143 and @entity144 was the widespread bending of rules by those high up in @entity8 's steel towers			1
this is reflected in the story as the @entity57 family scrambles to perform damage control once they become aware of the firm 's problems			0
' i think there were two sets of rules that were operating during that period , ' ms @entity12 said			2
' there were the rules that were on the books , and then there were the rules that were market - wide practice , and what a lot of people realized was that market - wide practice was n't always legal			0
' post- 2008 crisis , @entity13 said she believed that real - life ceo 's like that of @entity61 seemed to be under more scrutiny , and hoped that any increased attention would provide a check on power , along with better regulation and increased market transparency .			1
