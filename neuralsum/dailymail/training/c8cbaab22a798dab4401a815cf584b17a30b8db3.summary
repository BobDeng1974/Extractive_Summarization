by @entity0 published : 06:21 est , 14 june 2013 updated : 18:01 est , 14 june 2013 a year ago she was gliding majestically down the @entity2 at the head of the @entity5 flotilla			0
but this week the £ 1million royal barge @entity7 had a rather more undignified outing on the river			1
she lost her gilded crown figurehead after becoming jammed under one of the stone arches of @entity13 , where the 94ft barge had drifted after her engines failed			1
the @entity18 @entity17 has been damaged after it crashed into a bridge when its engines failed the barge was carried into the bridge by the incoming tide after its engines had stopped working while @entity26 crew were discussing the best way to help the barge , it came free and was blown to the other side of the span the winds then blew her back against the bridge , scraping her side and knocking the crown into the water			1
to make matters worse , a lifeboat sent out from @entity39 to rescue her ended up punching a golfball - sized hole in her side			0
@entity26 spokesman @entity41 said : ‘ the lifeboat attempted to get between the barge and the arch to prevent her from getting jammed again but could n’t get there in time			1
the side of the boat was damaged and its wooden ' crown ' was knocked off after it became trapped against the side of the bridge a photographer said the @entity26 crew created a hole in the side of the barge during the rescue attempt an onlooker said the @entity59 's skipper was ' furious ' with the @entity26 crew after they damaged the boat during the attempted rescue @entity62 has said it was important the boat was rescued as the tide was still rising , meaning it could have become even more firmly wedged under the bridge the 94ft @entity67 was unique among the vessels which took part in the flotilla to mark last year 's @entity5 in that it was the only one specially commissioned for the event			1
originally it was intended that the @entity18 or the @entity73 and @entity74 would be on board but @entity76 travelled along the @entity2 on the @entity77			0
@entity59 was designed to resemble vessels in @entity80 's famous painting of an 18th century river pageant on the @entity2			0
it was rowed by eighteen oarsmen , including @entity85 's greatest olympian sir @entity84 , during the @entity5 celebrations its construction was funded by @entity89 and it was the first @entity90 barge to be built for a century after being painstakingly put together over four years by 60 craftsmen			0
' the aft platform of the lifeboat came into contact with the port quarter of the barge causing slight damage			2
‘ it was important that the recovery was carried out quickly as the tide was rising			2
' @entity59 would have become even more firmly wedged under the bridge causing further damage to her superstructure			1
’ the barge was eventually brought under control and towed to @entity107			0
@entity7 , powered by 18 rowers on the day of the jubilee pageant , had been carrying two elderly passengers and two crew members when her engines failed on thursday evening			2
lord @entity89 , the former @entity113 chairman who built @entity7 , said the damage was ‘ quite superficial ’ and would be repaired			0
he added that the problem was caused by a new battery unit which ‘ had a mind of its own ’			0
