@entity0 has bought yet another block of flats – just weeks after snapping up ten apartments in @entity4			1
she and eldest son @entity5 have purchased 14 apartments in nearby @entity7 – dramatically increasing the family ’s property empire to 31 homes			1
the total would have been 32 , but earlier this month mrs @entity0 , 60 , sold the notorious ‘ @entity12 ’ flat in @entity13 she bought with the help of convicted @entity16 fraudster @entity15 in 2002			1
the apartments in the @entity29 appear to be more lucrative opportunities , with property prices rising faster there than anywhere else in the country , including @entity35			0
@entity36 of @entity4 - based @entity37 , which formerly owned the homes , called the @entity39 ’ latest purchase a ‘ good investment ’			2
he said : ‘ the flats are popular with young professionals in @entity7 , and were always full when we owned them			0
’ his firm sold the block – based on the site of a former scrap metal dealer – for more than £ 1million			0
last month the @entity39 snapped up this ten - flat block in @entity51 , @entity4 , for £ 650,000 as well as the buy - to - let flats in the @entity29 , the @entity39 have a considerable portfolio of private homes for themselves and their children			1
one of @entity56 and @entity0 ’s two @entity35 properties is a £ 3.65million five - storey @entity59 townhouse , which they bought in 2004			1
three years later they snapped up the £ 800,000 mews house behind it – and have since paid off the mortgage			0
in 2008 they bought a £ 5.75million @entity66 i listed @entity69 manor house			0
a £ 1.35million four - storey @entity59 property in the capital was bought for son @entity72 , 28 , last year – paid for in cash			2
and the couple also paid £ 600,000 in cash for a three - bedroom cottage in @entity69 for mr @entity78 ’s sister @entity77 the same year			0
they also purchased a £ 3.62million townhouse in the capital for @entity5 , 30 , and his wife @entity82			2
the £ 1.2million mews property behind it was bought for daughter @entity85 , 26 , in march			2
another firm , @entity86 , which owned the flats briefly over the summer , sold it to the @entity39 via their property company @entity89 apartments in the area are rented at about £ 450 a month , suggesting the @entity39 could reap about £ 75,000 a year as the landlords of the modern block , which is next to a pub in a relatively run - down part of @entity7			1
no details are known about the price paid for the property – purchased with the help of a mortgage – but it is likely to be about double the £ 650,000 they splashed out on a ten - flat block last month in @entity51 , @entity4			1
that property – where tenants include a @entity106 councillor – could earn the @entity39 £ 55,000 a year in rent payments			0
sources close to the family say they are buying properties in the @entity4 area as investments			0
@entity78 , who earns millions from global consultancy work , has insisted that reports of his £ 100million wealth are ‘ greatly exaggerated ’			0
however , the @entity39 have built a large property empire – even though mrs @entity0 encountered controversy in 2002 when she bought two @entity13 flats with a discount negotiated by conman @entity15 – who was dating mrs @entity0 ’s confidante @entity121 – at the time .			1
