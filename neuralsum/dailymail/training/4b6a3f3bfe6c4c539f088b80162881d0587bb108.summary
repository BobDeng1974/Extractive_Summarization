the ‘ highly respectable ’ father of seven – who suffered from arthritis and walked with the aid of a stick – is not believed to have been targeted in a mugging gone wrong because his wallet was found in his clothing			1
officers said they could not rule out the possibility the grandfather of 22 was the victim of a racist attack , and may have been followed for some or all of the half - mile journey from his mosque , but there was no evidence to support either theory			1
he was attacked opposite a primary school at 10.30pm , after leaving evening prayers at @entity49 mosque in @entity2 , @entity3 , where he prayed five times a day			1
