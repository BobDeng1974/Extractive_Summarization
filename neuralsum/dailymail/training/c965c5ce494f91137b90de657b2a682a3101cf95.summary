not something to snirtle about : author @entity1 is campaigning to preserve endangered words before they are lost from the @entity4 language forever a children 's author has launched a campaign to save old - fashioned words like begrumpled , ninnyhammer and slubberdegullion before they disappear from the @entity4 language for good			1
former journalist @entity1 has published a book called @entity11 which she hopes will breathe new life into obscure phrases and adjectives			1
many of the words - which also include terms like snirtle , fratchy and jargogle - were compiled after she invited people to come up with suggestions for the book			1
she told @entity22 : ' some are old - fashioned and have gone out of usage , others are family words that had been handed down from generation to generation and people were n't sure if they were proper words			2
' mrs @entity1 , who has worked with @entity31 refugees in @entity32 , said some wonderfully colourful words are in danger of being lost forever			1
around @entity35 aims to help children move away from texting and tweets and instead explore the spoken word			0
in the introduction , she says : ' let 's snatch begrumpled from the brink of obscurity ... we want to open our wink - a - peeps and champion their cause			0
' she also commissioned 20 women to make her a woollen ' cosy ' for the old @entity50 taxi that she drives featuring some of her favourite words			0
the project took four months and 20kg of wool			0
colourful campaign : mrs @entity1 has published @entity11 which features a number of endangered words including blatteroon , slubberdegullion and jargogle begrumpled - sad blatteroon - a senseless boaster fratchy - irritable @entity60 - to confuse or jumble @entity61 - belly - a bulging stomach @entity63 - a fool ramfeezled - exhausted snirtle - to laugh in snorts @entity66 - a scoundrel @entity68 - eyes the @entity4 passed the one - million word mark in 2009 , according to the @entity71			1
but mrs @entity1 says most people only need around 7,000 to get through everyday life			1
conversely , researchers earlier this year ranked 2,500 of our most commonly used words and compared them with the same list from 50 years ago			2
linguists at the @entity80 used computers to trawl through millions of books , speeches , studies and newspaper articles currently in circulation			0
they found ' marriage ' , ‘ childhood ’ , ‘ @entity90 ’ and ‘ religion ’ all fell in popularity but ‘ @entity93 ’ was on the up			0
and although ‘ modesty , ’ ‘ conscience ’ and ‘ gentleman ’ are no longer in vogue , ‘ sex ’ and ‘ celebrity ’ are far more common .			2

@entity1 features endangered words in @entity102 in 80 years
hopes it will breathe life into colourful terms no longer in common usage
