the widespread use of small recording devices pinned to officers ’ lapels would encourage more guilty pleas once offenders are confronted with footage of their actions , the home secretary said			1
they also ensure that time - consuming ‘ vexatious ’ complaints by known yobs against officers are promptly dismissed , she added			0
the home secretary said body - mounted cameras would help police convict more criminals			2
pictured , @entity22 officers with cameras attached to their hats thousands of police are already routinely using the devices , but mrs may endorsed their roll - out across every force in @entity30 and @entity31			1
her comments were welcomed by rank - and - file police groups , who said cameras helped convict drunken yobs who denied violent or abusive behaviour when hauled to court			2
however , privacy groups said the cameras could undermine trust between the police and the public and branded them an ‘ underhand surveillance tactic ’			2
@entity46 , deputy director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group @entity48 , said : ‘ the use of body - worn cameras has the potential to seriously undermine trust between the police and members of the community			1
‘ it is far from clear why the police need this kind of equipment , and the police should concentrate their efforts on engaging with the local community to tackle the issues of anti-social behaviour rather than resorting to underhand surveillance tactics			0
’ lightweight lapel cameras can record several hours of footage and sound and be switched on and off by officers when needed			1
the lightweight cameras are already used by five police forces in the @entity72 home secretary @entity1 said cameras can increase the number of guilty pleas five @entity30 forces – @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 and @entity82 – are already using them			1
they are also used in @entity85			0
mrs may told the @entity88 annual conference in @entity89 : ‘ evidence from @entity85 suggests that evidence from body - worn cameras can increase the number of early guilty pleas to the extent that 90 per cent of suspects confronted by that evidence plead guilty early			1
‘ they can also help by eliminating vexatious complaints from known troublemakers – something i know causes a lot of unnecessary stress and wastes too much time			0
’ @entity106 , deputy chairman of the @entity88 , said cameras were useful when dealing with drunken yobs who then arrived at court ‘ suited and booted ’ and disputed officers ’ accounts			1
‘ the cameras provide best evidence for police officers and make clear to the court what actually happened , ’ he said			2
in her speech , mrs may also condemned police officers who bring ‘ frivolous ’ legal claims against the public and warned that the fear of being sued could make citizens reluctant to dial 999			2
it is ‘ simply not the sort of attitude police officers should exhibit ’ she said – a reference to the case of @entity129 pc @entity127 who planned to sue a garage owner after tripping on a kerb while responding to a 999 call			0
mrs may also confirmed plans to prevent officers resigning to avoid disciplinary measures and agreed to publish the names of those who have been dismissed for misconduct			0
claims that police were downgrading offences were dismissed – with the national crime survey used as evidence that crime is now at an all - time low			0
and proposals to give whole - life jail terms to cop killers were met with applause			0
‘ to attack and kill a police officer is to attack the fundamental basis of our society , ’ she said .			0

offenders more likely to admit their actions if recorded , @entity1 said
