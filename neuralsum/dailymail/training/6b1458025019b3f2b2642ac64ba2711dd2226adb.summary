@entity0 is tapping her fingers on the table and pursing her lips as she thinks about how different her life is now she ’s well into her 60s			1
it takes her a while , but finally she comes up with an answer			1
‘ obviously one has to slow down a little bit , ’ she says with a grin			1
‘ i do n’t go clubbing until 3am any more			1
’ it used to be that 40 was old for an actress , and anything over 60 was practically unheard of			1
but try telling that to 67 - year - old @entity0 , who must be one of the hardest working people in television ; fresh from her documentary about the wildlife of the @entity20 she ’s down here on the @entity23 coast on the set of her new sitcom boomers			1
the show follows the lives and loves of a group of 60 - something baby boomers in a seaside town and is being talked about as the next @entity32			1
it begins with @entity0 ’s character @entity34 being forced to retire from her job as a receptionist			1
@entity34 knows she ’s going to miss being busy , and @entity0 can empathise			1
@entity0 , looking great at 67 as she prepares for a new role in sitcom boomers , set in a seaside resort retirement ’s a dirty word to her			1
‘ i try not to think about it , ’ she says			1
‘ actors are lucky because we do n’t have to retire			1
we can if we want to , of course , and sometimes the business retires us , which is a bit sad			1
i do get tired occasionally , though , and think , “ why am i doing this ? ” after boomers i ’ve got another job coming up , and a play after that			1
there have been times i ’ve turned things down and then wished i ’d done them , but it ’s nice to have a choice			2
’ she ’s part of a terrific cast in boomers , including @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 , who play some of @entity34 ’s friends , while old stalwart @entity67 is her much put - upon husband @entity68			1
comedy legend @entity69 , now 88 , also appears , as the drink - guzzling @entity70 , the mother of @entity63 ’s character @entity71			2
‘ june ’s amazing , as sharp as anything , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ she ’s a real example of what you can do if you ’ve still got your health and your mind			2
’ the characters in boomers seem very real – they are , after all , based on the family of writer @entity81 , whose previous credits include @entity83 and @entity84			1
‘ one minute they ’re getting on great , the next they ’re having a little snipe , ’ says @entity0 , laughing			1
‘ my character ’s a bit of an organiser			2
poor guy , he ca n’t do anything right , so that made it fun to play			2
i hope i ’m not the bully she is , but we all know couples like that			2
’ each episode will follow one of the characters as they negotiate relationships , retirement and problems with their children or parents			1
‘ people will look at it and think , “ i do that ! ” it ’s very real , ’ adds @entity0			1
above all , she ’s pleased tv executives are finally realising there ’s an older audience out there and making programmes to appeal to them			1
‘ i think they ’ve probably done a few surveys and realised the majority of viewers are over 50			2
people in their 20s are often out and tend to watch tv through catch - up services			2
@entity0 as mrs @entity124 , with @entity125 as @entity126 , in the @entity128 's 1995 @entity127 but the people who regularly sit in during the week are around my age			1
and that age group wants something it can relate to ; we all like to be able to recognise ourselves on tv , do n’t we ? life does n’t stop once you reach a certain age and television bosses are seeing that			1
your hopes and desires continue as they always have			2
’ it ’s not just in the acting world that @entity0 is working hard ; she ’s also trying to launch a new career as a wildlife reporter			1
a lifelong birdwatcher who ’s been known to get up at the crack of dawn to enjoy her hobby even when she ’s filming a show , she ’s only now getting the chance to show off this other side to her			2
two recent tv projects – her @entity20 documentary on @entity156 and a series about how to find your way in the countryside without maps for the @entity128 a few years ago – represent just the thin end of the wedge of her ambitions			2
‘ i ’d really like to do more wildlife things , particularly in conservation , ’ she says			2
‘ i ’ve been trying to do a show about the overuse of plastics for years but no one wants to make it			2
creatures are choking on it			2
’ the @entity174 has campaigned against supermarket plastic bags , and @entity0 says she ’s passionate about getting the message across			1
‘ a lot of people are unaware of the nightmare that goes on in our seas , ’ she says			2
@entity0 with @entity182 ( far left ) and @entity183 in hit sitcom @entity184 which ran from 2007 to 2010 ‘ if we could make everyone aware it might be our chance to change things			1
i read about this turtle that washed up on a beach in @entity193 with around 280 carrier bags in its stomach			2
‘ of course these bags look like jellyfish to a turtle			0
apart from choking , they can starve to death because carrier bags are n’t biodegradable			0
they build up and the animals ca n’t get any nourishment so they get weaker and weaker – can you imagine what it ’s like to die like that ? this is happening to thousands of creatures , and most people are n’t aware of it			0
i see intelligent , educated people using 12 or 15 carrier bags every time they go to @entity216 or @entity217			1
if you charge 10p a bag it does n’t matter			0
unless you charge £ 20 a bag people wo n’t stop			0
’ with her @entity223 co-stars , much loved @entity226 actors @entity65 , @entity63 , @entity227 , @entity64 and @entity67 she ’s a surprise , is @entity0			1
the @entity230 - born actress is softly spoken , but she ’s clearly passionate about the world			1
the youngest of three girls , whose father was an electrical supervisor , she showed a talent for mimicry at a young age			0
she trained as a secretary and started work in a probation office , but hated it and applied for the @entity243 drama school in @entity244			0
her audition report said , ‘ worth training , will blossom ’			0
another pupil at the drama school was @entity248 who she met in her second year in 1966 ; he became her husband and father of her sons , director @entity252 , now 36 , and cinematographer @entity253 , now 32			0
he was also to be her greatest collaborator			0
their most famous joint enterprise was when @entity0 played the monstrous @entity257 in @entity248 ’s @entity258 on stage and tv			1
she ’s since played a succession of opinionated ladies , including @entity263 in @entity184 , mrs @entity124 in @entity127 and now @entity34			0
‘ why do i get cast in these roles ? ’ she says with a laugh			0
‘ i ’m a shrinking violet ! ’ her marriage to @entity248 lasted 22 years but the two were reportedly having problems when she met and fell in love with actor @entity271 when he played her husband in the tv series @entity274 18 years ago			0
they live in @entity275 , @entity276 , but she remains good friends with @entity248			0
she says she still feels young – in her downtime she wears jeans and trendy boots rather than ‘ grannified ’ dresses			0
she looks fantastic – although her good skin is entirely natural			0
she stopped using expensive face creams when she realised they did n’t make a jot of difference ; she uses £ 3.99 - a - pot @entity287			0
she ’s always said she ’d never have @entity288 or have a face - lift			0
instead she credits her youthfulness with walking a lot and eating healthily			0
she seems to keep up with everything , including texting and emailing			0
‘ i like to keep in touch with the world , ’ she says			0
‘ i love going to the theatre and the cinema and i do n’t think i ’d ever want to be in a situation where i was cut off from younger people			0
i like @entity276 life ; i like to keep up with it			0
sometimes the pace of change amazes me			0
in 20 years things have moved so quickly			0
i suppose in another 20 years we ’ll all be laughing at cds and dvds			0
’ she ’s close to her sons , who to her dismay are yet to make her a grandmother , and says they help keep her up to date with things ; ‘ with all their chat and their banter ; what they ’re doing and where they ’re going			0
’ she adds , with a knowing smile , ‘ and of course one hopes now and again that you can offer a bit of advice about what you ’ve been through , even though probably nobody takes it			0
’ the shoot for @entity223 in @entity328 is an intense one – up at 5am and filming by 7am – but for this workaholic near - septuagenerian that ’s all part of the fun			0
‘ it ’s been so busy i have n’t even had time to read the newspapers , which is a big deal for me , ’ she says			0
‘ but i ’ve been doing a lot of singing			0
i have a karaoke machine and if i ’m feeling stressed i sing – @entity340 , @entity341 , @entity342 , anything my voice can cope with			0
b * * * * r the neighbours ! ’ laughs this ever - surprising actress .			1
