by @entity0 published : 12:19 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 02:05 est , 12 july 2012 a @entity2 leader has admitted the insurgents can not win the war in @entity5			1
the senior commander said it would take ‘ divine intervention ’ for the hardline group to recapture @entity9			1
but he said @entity2 chiefs could not admit this weakness because it would harm the morale of their fighters - raising the prospect that more @entity17 blood will be shed on the battlefield before combat troops withdraw in 2014			2
defeat : insurgents will not win the war in @entity5 warns a senior @entity2 leader in an extraordinary interview with the @entity24 , the veteran also launches a withering attack on @entity26 , branding the jihadists a ‘ plague ’			1
‘ at least 70 per cent of the @entity2 are angry at @entity26 , ’ said the former @entity30 inmate			2
‘ our people consider @entity26 to be a plague that was sent down to us by the heavens			2
‘ to tell the truth , i was relieved at the death of @entity38 [ @entity38 ]			2
through his policies , he destroyed @entity5			2
if he really believed in jihad he should have gone to @entity41 and done jihad there , rather than wrecking our country			2
’ the @entity2 commander - identified only as @entity45 in the interview - was speaking to @entity47 , a former @entity48 envoy to @entity9 who had maintained strong contacts with the radical group			1
despite the insurgents pumping out triumphalist rhetoric about their successes against coalition forces , @entity45 said the only way forward for the group is to come to a political agreement with opponents			1
shocking : a video clip of a @entity2 soldier gunning down a woman sparked international outrage this week fury : @entity5 women hold banners and placards during a protest against the execution of the unnamed @entity5 woman by @entity2 militants he said : ‘ the @entity2 capturing @entity9 is a very distant prospect			1
‘ any @entity2 leader expecting to be able to capture @entity9 is making a grave mistake			1
‘ nevertheless , the leadership also knows that it can not afford to acknowledge this weakness			0
‘ to do so would undermine the morale of @entity2 personnel			0
the leadership knows the truth – that they can not prevail over the power they confront			0
‘ it would take some kind of divine intervention for the @entity2 to win this war			1
’ the @entity2 , he said , had shelved its vision of re-establishing the @entity91 emirate it set up when in power from 1996 to 2001			0
this regime banned women from education , carried out thousands of executions as rough justice and outlawed eating lobster , even though @entity5 has no coastline			0
cost of war : a total of 422 @entity17 troops have been killed since the conflict began in 2001 ‘ any side involved in a conflict like this has decided to fight for power , ’ he said			0
‘ if they fall short of national power , they have to settle for functioning as an organised party within the country			0
’ mr @entity47 said speaking unofficially allowed @entity45 to stray from the @entity2 ’s ‘ party line ’ and reflect the views of its pragmatic wing			0
this , he said , was a sign that the group wanted to re-open talks with the @entity121 however , only a few days ago video footage was released depicting the unwavering brutality of the @entity2 , executing a woman for adultery			1
she was machinegunned in cold blood because two commanders could not decide who should ‘ own ’ her			0
@entity45 ’s suggestion that the @entity2 could be open to dialogue was welcomed by @entity132 politicians with former foreign secretary @entity133 calling the commander ’s comments a ‘ landmark ’ moment			1
‘ the candour and clarity of the remarks about @entity26 , @entity141 and the @entity5 government show we are dealing with a sophisticated and long - term presence , ’ he said			0
a total of 422 @entity17 troops have been killed since the war began in 2001 .			0
