from her outrageously tiny waist to her unfeasibly long legs , the world 's most famous doll has long been the target of criticism from feminists and other women 's groups who say it promotes an unhealthy idea of body image in girls			2
several artists have set about proving the public 's claim by scaling the iconic doll up to human size , to reveal her unrealistic measurements compared to the average human girl			2
but now , in a role reversal , one artist has shown what @entity24 would look like as the average 19 - year - old girl and the results are surprising			1
unhealthy vs healthy : thanks to her ultra-slender measurements , it has been estimated that , if she were to exist as a human , @entity24 would be anorexic - here she is pictured next to a @entity36 doll artist @entity37 of @entity38 used the measurements of an average 19 - year - old woman to create a 3 - d model , which he photographed next to a standard @entity24 doll			1
@entity37 then photoshopped the 3 - d model to make it look like a @entity24 doll			1
in his previous research , @entity37 found that , scaled up to human size , @entity24 dolls would have unrealistic measurements of 36 - 18 - 33 , compared with the typical 19 - year - old girl 's 32 - 31 - 33			1
the average woman , meanwhile , has 38 inch back , a 34 inch waist and hips that measure 40 inches around , and @entity37 's work shows that @entity24 looks a lot more natural with these measurements			1
measured up : artist @entity37 of used the measurements of an average 19 - year - old woman to create a 3 - d model , which he photographed next to a standard @entity24 doll comparison : photos of a @entity24 doll and the @entity62 printed model were taken and a @entity64 was applied to the @entity62 printed model to make it look like a @entity24 doll packaged : in his research , ms @entity68 found that , scaled up to human size , @entity24 dolls would have unrealistic measurements of 36 - 18 - 33 , compared with the typical 19 - year - old girl 's 32 - 31 - 33 ( right ) thanks to her ultra-slender measurements , it has been estimated that , if she were to exist as a human , @entity24 would weigh about 110lbs - or 7 stone , 8lbs - and would have a @entity79 of 16.24			1
this would fit the weight criteria for anorexia			2
speaking about his latest work , he said : ' my last @entity24 project got a lot of criticism because @entity24 is just a toy			0
' people argue that a toy ca n't do any harm			0
' however , if we criticise skinny models , we should at least be open to the possibility that @entity24 may negatively influence young girls as well			0
' furthermore , a realistically proportioned @entity24 actually looks pretty good in the pictures i produced			0
' so , if there 's even a small chance of @entity24 in its present form negatively influencing girls , and if @entity24 looks good as an average sized woman in @entity104			2
what 's stopping @entity106 from making one ? ' role reversal : whilst most artists have previously put @entity24 's measurements onto a normal girl , @entity37 did it the other way round fit to size : barbie dolls would have unrealistic measurements of 36 - 18 - 33 , compared with the typical 19 - year - old girl 's 32 - 31 - 33 negative : ' if there 's even a small chance of @entity24 in its present form negatively influencing girls , and if @entity24 looks good as an average sized woman in @entity104			1
what 's stopping @entity106 from making one ? ' asks @entity37 @entity37 is a 24 year old artist and researcher from @entity125 , @entity126			1
he graduated from the @entity127 in 2011 from the @entity128			0
speaking about his passion , he said : ' i always loved to draw and almost went to an art school instead of university			0
i combine art and research together to create compelling illustrations			0
' each blog post i make takes around 1 - 4 weeks to create			0
i feel very fortunate to make a living doing what i love to do			0

artist shows what @entity24 would look like as an average 19 - year - old
created 3 - d model , which he photographed next to a standard @entity24 doll
@entity24 's proportions would fit the criteria for an anorexic in real life
' @entity24 looks healthy and *shapely*
artist wants @entity106 to start making more realistic dolls
