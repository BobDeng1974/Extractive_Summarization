by @entity0 published : 12:47 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 12:51 est , 4 august 2013 an editor of @entity3 @entity2 has written a book about the ' scandalous ' life she led as a celibate woman in today 's sex - obsessed society			1
@entity8 , 50 , has named her memoir ( @entity3 : roman ) @entity11			1
it is ' a m√©lange ' of things that happened to her , vignettes and semi-autobiographical anecdotes			0
the decision simply to not have sex is most refreshing and unusual for someone who does not define themselves as asexual			0
in fact , asexual is a word she rejects along with celibacy , chastity and abstinence , opting instead for " singularity "			0
@entity8 says the fact that women can make love when and how they want is sexual liberation			1
but sexual liberation is also to not do it , if you do n't want to ' people were saying , " this is insane , this account you 've written about your life ... how is it possible ? " they talked to me as though i were some sort of animal , ' says @entity8			1
the 50 - year - old editor and author experienced a period of prolonged self - imposed celibacy that was ' so easy ' to embark on			1
the book is less about ' why ' and more on ' what ' and what it means			0
however , her singularity ended its 12 year run when she rekindled her sexuality with her partner - a then - married man			1
' if you force yourself to make love , your sex life is n't as good as the one you dreamt of or expected , if you do n't feel respected , can you just stop ? the answer is yes , ' she says , speaking with the @entity63 's @entity62			0
' the fact that women can make love when and how they want is sexual liberation			1
but sexual liberation is also to not do it , if you do n't want to			2
' ' what is miraculous about sexuality is that is can die out but it can be rekindled in seconds , ' says @entity8 , who has never married nor had children			2
she admits : ' as i said in the book , there are two things i missed when i stopped having sex			0
' one is the loss of self when you make love , you are always in control			0
the second thing is to be caressed , to be in someone 's arms , with your head on his shoulders			0
' ' if your sex life is n't as good as the one you dreamt of , can you just stop ? ' philosophises @entity8			2
