by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity3 ’s dream of building a £ 100billion airport in the @entity5 appeared to be dead in the water last night after @entity8 advisers warned it was unrealistic			1
the extravagant scheme should be dropped from a review of @entity15 ’s future airport capacity , former @entity11 chief sir @entity10 is expected to tell ministers today			1
the scheme , dubbed @entity17 , would have seen a new four - runway hub airport built in the @entity5 with high - speed rail links to @entity20			1
artist 's impression : the extravagant £ 100billion airport in the @entity25 estuary scheme should be dropped from a review of @entity15 's future airport capacity , former @entity11 chief sir @entity10 is expected to tell ministers the @entity20 mayor argued that , with expansion at @entity31 constrained , the idea was the only way to keep the @entity15 competitive in terms of airport capacity			1
but the independent @entity36 , which was set up to tackle the need for increased airport capacity and is led by sir @entity10 , will today urge ministers to focus instead on expansion at either @entity31 or @entity40			1
one source said the @entity17 idea would be attacked with ‘ every conceivable sledgehammer ’			0
mr @entity3 fought hard last year to get his plan included on the @entity36 ’s short - list in the face of scepticism from experts , who warned it was too costly and would face major environmental hurdles			1
it leaves the @entity36 now looking at three detailed options – two for expanding @entity31 , and one for increasing capacity at @entity40			2
@entity31 ’s owners have proposed building a third runway , while the second option would be to increase the length of one of the existing runways to allow it to handle more flights			2
setback : the @entity20 mayor argued that , with expansion at @entity31 constrained , the idea was the only way to keep the @entity15 competitive in terms of airport capacity both options are estimated to cost about £ 18 billion			1
the option to build a second runway at @entity40 would cost an estimated £ 9billion , but enjoys less support from the business community			2
mr @entity3 yesterday described the idea of expanding @entity31 as ‘ madness ’			1
repeating his preference for a new site , he dismissed @entity31 plans as ‘ self - defeating ’ and ‘ barbarically contemptuous of the rights of the population ’			0
he added : ‘ what frustrates me is that a third runway at @entity31 is so desperately short - sighted			0
‘ you could not conceivably get it built before 2029 , by the airport ’s own admission – and as soon as it opened it would be full			2
’ mr @entity3 said the @entity31 expansion would lead to medical problems associated with pollution , as well as congestion on the road network			1
other critics warn the plan would require the demolition of hundreds of homes and lead to increased noise pollution in the area			0
the @entity11 yesterday urged the @entity36 to come forward quickly with a ‘ spades in the ground ’ solution to the lack of capacity , which it said was damaging @entity15 ’s competitiveness			2
deputy director - general @entity105 said : ‘ it tends to be hub airports that deliver the new connections to emerging markets that we desperately need			0
‘ with @entity31 full and the @entity15 slipping behind in the race for new connectivity , it is essential that the @entity36 delivers a solution that addresses the ticking timebomb of our lack of spare hub capacity			0
’ @entity119 publicly opposed the expansion of @entity31 at the last election , but @entity31 will now dominate the @entity36 ’s work			0
the @entity36 is not set to report its decision until after the election			0
expansion : @entity31 's owners have proposed building a third runway			1
the second option would be to increase the length of one of the existing runways			0
above , planes queue for takeoff at @entity31			0

@entity3 dreamed of building £ 100billion airport in the @entity5
he said it was the only way to keep airports competitive in terms of capacity
but independent commission will today urge ministers to focus on expansion
