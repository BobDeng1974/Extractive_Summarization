if it seems you are permanently single while everyone else around you is in a relationship , blame your dna			2
scientists have identified a ‘ singleton gene ’ , and found that those who have it are 20 per cent more likely to be single than others			1
it is thought that by lowering levels of the feel - good brain chemical serotonin , the gene makes people less comfortable in close relationships			1
this could make it harder to form them in the first place - or lead to break - up after break - up			2
those with it are 20 per cent more likely to be single than others the scientists from @entity31 in @entity23 tested hair samples from almost 600 @entity34 university students to analyse a gene called 5 - @entity36 , which comes in two different versions			1
those with the ‘ g ’ version were much more likely to be single than those with the ‘ c ’ version			1
some 60 per cent were not in a relationship - compared to 50 per cent of those in the c group			2
women are increasingly putting their husband 's career before their own , a controversial separate study of @entity47 graduates has found			0
it canvassed more than 25,000 male and female students , and found 40 per cent of @entity54 and ' boomer ' women said their spouses ' careers took priority over theirs			2
the researchers also said only about 20 per cent of them had planned on their careers taking a back seat when they graduated			1
they concluded that while women had good intentions when they graduated , they ultimately ended up being held back by their partners			0
importantly , the link could n’t be explained by other factors that influence relationships , including appearance and wealth			0
the key to the findings seems to be the role of the 5 - @entity36 gene in the brain			1
those with the ‘ g ’ , or singleton , version make less serotonin , a brain chemical involved in mood and happiness			1
it was already known that people with the ‘ g ’ allele , or version , find it more difficult to get close to others			1
plus , they are more likely to be neurotic and to suffer from depression			0
writing in the journal @entity93 , the researchers said : ‘ as pessimism and neuroticism are detrimental to the formation , quality and stability of relationships , this connection between the @entity87 allele and psychological disorders might decrease carriers ’ dating opportunities or lead to romantic relationship failure			1
’ the researchers said that students may have more free time and freedom to form relationships than others			1
and at other times of life , other factors , such as pressure from parents to marry , may be much more influential			0
despite this , they concluded that their study provides ‘ evidence for genetic contribution to social relationships in certain contexts ’			2
other scientists said that while genes will inevitably influence relationships , their role in most cases will be small			2
hair samples from almost 600 @entity34 students were tested by scientists			1
those with the ‘ g ’ version of the 5 - @entity36 gene were much more likely to be single than those with the ‘ c ’ version			1
it suggests some people struggle to date and maintain relationships ( stock image shown ) than others dr @entity143 , a relationship expert , said that we do n’t have to let our genes rule our lives			2
she said : ‘ i know that our genetic heritage determines some of our behaviour but we always have choice			0
‘ if someone ’s difficulties with dating are flagged up to them , i believe they can learn to interact in a way that will make them more successful in meeting somebody			0
‘ i feel quite optimistic about that			0
’ professor @entity159 , an expert in the role of genes from @entity162 , questioned how strong the research was			0
however , studies show that our odds of getting married and staying married and our number of sexual partners are all influenced by our dna			0
despite this , genes are not the be all and end all			0
simple evidence for this comes from looking at identical twins			0
they are usually attracted to the same type of person initially , but end up settling down with very different mates .			0

researchers in @entity23 say some people are born with a ' singleton gene '
those with it are 20 per cent more likely to be single than others
hair samples from almost 600 @entity34 students were tested by scientists
those with the ‘ g ’ version of the 5 - @entity36 gene were much more likely to be single than those with the ‘ c ’ version , according to the researchers
