five baggage handlers have been sacked by @entity1 after a video showing passengers ’ luggage being carelessly tossed onto a conveyor belt caused outrage online			1
the 90 - second clip was filmed by a witness in an indoor area restricted to workers at @entity11 in @entity12			1
it shows two male employees in blue uniforms recklessly hurling large suitcases onto the belt and against a wall as they unload a truck			1
for nearly two minutes the men are filmed throwing or flinging several suitcases without care they appear to be unaware they are being filmed by someone standing on an elevated walkway			0
it is not clear if the person who filmed the shocking moment on a mobile phone is a colleague			0
as the video begins it shows one man throwing a large suitcase , which lands on the belt with a heavy thud			1
seconds later the men grab either end of a bag and throw it so hard that it hits a green barrier , causing it to shake as the suitcase bounded off of it and lands on the belt			2
for nearly two minutes the employees of @entity1 , also known as @entity1 , toss suitcases or fling them behind their backs without care or caution , apparently in an attempt to unload the truck as quickly as possible			0
an object that appears to be fragile ( left ) is thrown ; the workers throw two bags simultaneously ( right ) some appear to be quite heavy or wrapped as though they contain fragile objects			1
it is believed at least one other employees , who is not seen on camera , is inside the truck to move luggage closer to the pair doing the throwing			1
in a statement posted on its website @entity67 ’s @entity68 ( @entity68 ) confirmed that two supervisors and three baggage handlers have been sacked after the video surfaced online			1
it expressed regret over the incident and said it will not tolerate such behaviour			0
the men throw the bags with such force that they land with a heavy thud or hit a green barrier against the wall titled ‘ @entity1 baggage handlers hard at work ’ , the video was uploaded to @entity86 , where it has nearly 100,000 views			1
the person who uploaded the clip wrote : ‘ looks like they are trying very hard to break things			2
and not such a fun job			0
’ rough handling of baggage is a fear shared by many passengers , and dozens of @entity86 users wrote that they were upset or not surprised at all			2
one user wrote : ‘ they do n't appear to be trying to break anything			0
they appear not to care if anything breaks or not			0
i doubt any other airline is much different			0
do n't pack crystal when you travel			0
’ another added : ‘ airlines might as well just use a dump truck to load and unload luggage			2
it 's quicker and your luggage would be treated a little better			2
