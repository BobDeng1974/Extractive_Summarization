the @entity9 suffered a 3 - 1 first leg defeat at home in their @entity12 last 16 encounter on wednesday - a damaging result that means they will have to score at least three goals in the @entity7 principality on march 17 if they are to have any chance of reaching the quarter - finals			1
@entity1 was guilty of missing two clear - cut chances for the north @entity21 outfit against @entity3 , but @entity0 insists the blame for the defeat should rest solely upon the 28 - year - old 's shoulders			1
@entity5 manager @entity0 says @entity1 is n't to blame for their defeat to @entity3 on wednesday @entity1 ( centre ) watches on after missing a guilt - edge chance against @entity3 in a frustrating display @entity0 found it painful viewing as his @entity5 side capitulated at home to @entity3 on wednesday speaking at the club 's press conference on friday , he said : ‘ i hope not			1
he ’s a strong character , @entity37 , and personally i do n’t blame him at all			1
we lost as a team			2
we fight for each other as a team			2
he worked hard for the team			2
he did n’t miss the chances on purpose			2
he wanted to score but it can happen			2
‘ he ’s like everyone else - disappointed			1
there ’s no one to blame individually			2
which striker does n’t miss chances ? he has his chances and missed them			2
on the night everything went against us			2
missing some chances was only one of the characteristics of the night			2
‘ what is important now is to respond well			2
we are on a strong run in the @entity59			1
we have to respond to that disappointment			2
i expect a strong response because it ’s a different competition and we have an opportunity to stabilise our position in the top three			0
we want to take it			0
' the @entity5 boss is still adamant they could still come back from their 3 - 1 deficit to @entity3			1
‘ we are still in the competition , we have a difficult task but it ’s still feasible , ' he added			0
' it looks a terrible week for @entity72 clubs in @entity73			0
i do n’t have any rational explanation for that			0
it ’s just a shock that hits us			0
is there any rationality behind that , i do n’t know ? ‘ we have played over 180 games in the @entity12			1
we have fought very hard against @entity82 just to qualify			0
you could see @entity82 is a good team playing against @entity84 last [ thursday ] night , so we won some important games			0
@entity86 rolled back the years with a glorious finish as @entity3 scored three away goals @entity5 players look dejected during the match as they now face a daunting second leg comeback attempt @entity92 gave the @entity9 hope when he made the score 2 - 1 late on before @entity3 's third ' what is frustrating is that we have gone out in the last 16 in the last four years , but twice against the future winners of the competition			1
this time we are still not out			0
we are still in the @entity12 - so do n’t deal us out too quickly			1
‘ we have to live with the reaction and what is important is to give a strong response when we are a big club			0
we are a club who interest many people and that gives us a stronger responsibility and of course when you come out of a disappointing game like wednesday night you do n’t expect people to applaud			0
it ’s absolutely normal we get criticised			0
what is hurting is the defeat , more than the criticism			0
i do n’t say i ’m immune to criticism			0
i love to win and when i do n’t win i ’m hurt of course			1
’ the 65 - year - old also revealed he will make changes for this weekend 's game against @entity118			1
‘ i have not made any decision for sunday ’s game			1
we have to rotate a little bit because there is sunday and wednesday games			1
' there will certainly be some changes			0
@entity118 have gone through but the @entity126 and @entity59 are different competition but we know that our strengths at home will be vital to strengthen our position			1
we have an opportunity we want to take			0
’ and he urged the fans to maintain their backing , despite the boos of wednesday night			0
‘ you ’re not a fan for one game for a fan for the club and no matter how big your club is you play 55 games a year and you have disappointing moments but we are third in the league , we ’re on strong run			1
we ’re not playing not to go down			0
we want to finish the season in strong way			0
