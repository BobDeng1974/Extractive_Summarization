by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 08:10 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 08:49 est , 11 january 2013 passengers on a @entity4 jet flying over @entity5 got a shock when they spotted a 12ft python clinging on to a wing at 30,000ft			1
the plane was around 20 minutes into its flight from @entity11 in northern @entity5 to @entity12 when a female passenger first announced she could see the reptile			1
those on board could only watch as the snake - thought to be a @entity19 - spent the flight battling to survive in freezing conditions			1
scroll down to watch ! bizarre : passengers were shocked to see the snake - thought to be a @entity19 - hanging from one of the plane 's wings cold : passengers could only look on as the reptile battled to survive during the flight from @entity11 in northern @entity5 to @entity12 fight : the snake is thought to have got into a landing gear cavity to keep warm before the plane took off unlike in the @entity32 movie , snakes on a plane , which featured a nest of vipers causing havoc when they escaped inside a jet - this reptile was more concerned about keeping itself alive the snake fought to find some shelter from the 300mph wind as temperatures dropped to as low as -12c Â°			1
passenger @entity44 told the @entity45 that people at the rear of the plane were totally focused on the snake and were asking how it could have got there			2
' there was no panic , ' he said , ' at no time did anyone stop to consider there might be others on board			0
' mr @entity44 said that at first the snake must have been tucked itself away in a small space near the wing but that the wind must pulled him ' straight out , ' he told the newspaper			2
what followed , said mr @entity44 , was a life and death struggle for the snake			0
worry : even a pilot reportedly took a look at the python as it tried to pull itself to safety injured : the snake 's battered body hangs limply from the wing after the plane landed in @entity12 - with blood stains visible around it			1
it was nevertheless thought to be still alive ' i felt quite sad for it really , ' he said , ' for the remainder of the trip he was trying to pull himself back into the plane			2
' despite the cold and wind , he said , the snake still managed to hang on , but each time it managed to pull itself back into a cavity , the wind forced it out again			0
snakes - such as this @entity94 - have cold blood , which could have helped the scrub python survive its epic plane journey it is unclear exactly how the python survived his freezing plane journey to @entity12 - but as a cold blooded ( or ' poikilothermic ' ) creature its ability to alternate its body temperature to cope with its environment would have helped			1
cold - blooded creatures are much more active in warm environments and slow down in cold environments			0
mammals , including humans , by contrast are homoiothermic , or ' warm - blooded ' and try to maintain a constant body temperature			0
at one point the pilot came out into the main cabin and took a look a the wing snake - which he said ' should be dead , ' given the battering it had taken			2
but , amazingly , when the plane touched down in @entity122 the snake was still moving			0
it was not immediately known what happened to the reptile but passengers suspected it would have been destroyed by @entity12 quarantine officials			1
@entity5 snake experts said it was a non - toxic scrub python , the longest snake species in @entity5 , which are common in @entity132			1
@entity133 , who represents an aircraft engineers ' association , told the @entity45 the snake had probably crawled up inside the landing bay before crawling into the trailing ledge flap assembly			0
' @entity141 and warm there , ' he said , ' but [ as ] the plane later takes off , the flaps move back and he ' s probably become shaken because of all the noise and vibration			0
once he 's moved , he 's become caught in the wind			0
