by @entity0 published : 05:18 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 09:45 est , 5 january 2013 @entity3 bounty hunters should not be allowed to raise the wreck of one of @entity7 's greatest warships and take some of the millions of pounds of gold it contains , it has today been claimed			1
leading archaeologists and descendants of the crew of @entity13 , predecessor to @entity16 's flagship , say that allowing it to be exploited for commercial gain would be a ' flagrant breach ' of the military covenant and a betrayal of the more than 1,000 @entity23 sailors who died			1
in 2008 , the wreck was discovered by @entity25 , a @entity3 company , some 264 years after it sank in a storm off the @entity27			1
@entity3 bounty hunters should not be allowed to raise the wreck of the @entity13 and take some of the millions of pounds of gold it contains , it has today been claimed it is believed it could contain gold worth hundreds of millions of pounds and 100 bronze cannon			1
the @entity36 has said recovery could go ahead under the ' auspices of a charity '			0
the @entity40 , which was set up by @entity41 , formerly sir @entity42 a descendant of admiral sir @entity44 , the ship 's commander , was founded for the purpose			0
it has submitted plans to the @entity36 and @entity49 and agreed a contract with @entity25 which would give the firm 80 per cent of the value of coins and bullion and 50 per cent of the value of cultural artefacts			1
the government is expected to make an announcement soon on whether it will allow the proposals to go ahead			0
' there is only one opportunity to gather the unique evidence of our past from these ' time - capsules ' of history and this should not be squandered for short - term financial gain			2
' in a letter to the @entity71 , @entity72 , another descendant of admiral sir @entity44 , and @entity73 , chairman of the @entity74 , said it ' represented the most inappropriate and distasteful kind of commercial exploitation			2
' they said that any finds raised from the ship would be sold on the antiquities market for private gain			2
they also said the @entity40 had not got the relevant experience or discernible resources			0
the committee said : ' the @entity74 's position is that historic wrecks in international waters should not be salvaged or excavated for commercial gain			1
' only if a wreck is under severe threat , or there is a clear research objective , should excavation take place			2
otherwise the wreck should be left in situ			2
most of these wrecks lie in very deep water and excavation techniques at depth using remote operated vehicles ( @entity102 's ) are in their infancy			0
' salvage today will almost certainly lead to the unnecessary loss of irreplaceable historical information			0
there is only one opportunity to gather the unique evidence of our past from these ' time - capsules ' of history and this should not be squandered for short - term financial gain			2
' @entity25 discovered the site nearly 100 km from where the ship was historically believed to have been wrecked on a reef near the @entity27 a cannon recovered from @entity13			1
it is believed it could contain gold worth hundreds of millions of pounds and 100 bronze cannon @entity13 was lost in 1744 under the command of admiral sir @entity44			1
the direct predecessor and inspiration behind @entity16 's flagship , @entity44 's @entity13 was the mightiest and most technically advanced vessel of her age experts say that if @entity13 , which sank on duty in 1744 , were a 20th century vessel , it would be protected by sovereign immunity			1
the vessel , predecessor of @entity16 's famous flagship , went down in a storm off the @entity27 in 1744 , taking more than 1,000 soldiers to their deaths			0
along with a bronze cannon collection , some believe the ship was carrying a large quantity of gold coins from @entity147 to @entity7 , which would now be worth a reported £ 500 million			1
the ship 's location remained a mystery despite numerous searches , until @entity25 discovered the wreck in may 2008			1
the @entity154 - based firm found the site 330ft under the @entity156 , nearly 65 miles from where the ship was historically believed to have been wrecked , near the @entity27			2
the @entity159 financial publication @entity160 reported on november 18 1744 , a month after the ship sank : ' people will have it that on board of the @entity13 was a sum of 400,000 pounds sterling that it had brought from @entity147 for our merchants			1
' it was also thought that large quantities of silver and gold coins would have been on board the victory from enemy prize ships captured by @entity42 , worth 120,000 pounds sterling at the time			1
the recovery of the ship would cost up to £ 25million			0
last year during a debate on @entity13 , @entity179 said that a @entity182 ( @entity182 ) convention said the excavation of wrecks should not be financed by selling the items recovered			0
the @entity187 professor said to contravene it would be setting a terrible example			0
he added that there were ' major ethical issues ' involved , and that the government were giving a poor and ill informed lead internationally in their dealings with @entity7 's underwater heritage			0
@entity196 , chairman of @entity197 , which sits on a committee to advise the @entity36 and the @entity49 , said the charity was concerned about @entity25 's proposed plans to manage the site			1
she said : ' we do not believe that the proposals for the wreck are based on an adequate and authoritative assessment of its historical significance , nor a full understanding of the threats to and vulnerabilities of the site			0
' we urge the government to think hard about this , to recognise that our maritime heritage is an exceptional national asset , not an overseas commodity , and to act with resolve			0
' because the wreck is in international waters , it is not protected , lord @entity41 said			0
while he maintains that @entity25 is ' wholly reputable ' , it was at the centre of controversy after lifting 17 tons of silver coins from the wreck of a @entity226 frigate sunk by the @entity23 in 1804			1
it was ordered to return the cargo without compensation last year			0
a @entity3 judge said the ship should have lain undisturbed .			0

in 2008 , the wreck was discovered by @entity25 , 264 years after it sank
it is believed it could contain gold worth hundreds of millions of pounds and 100 bronze cannon
descendants of crew and experts say it could betray those killed to exploit it for commercial gain
