a senior @entity2 adviser has claimed he was sacked after blowing the whistle when civil service bosses ' killed off ' a flagship proposal by @entity6 they were accused of undermining democracy as an official document setting out the job description of permanent secretaries was revealed , suggesting civil servants could pick and choose when they backed their political bosses			1
cabinet office minister @entity30 criticised the terms used for the recruitment of top @entity34 mandarins , claiming it ‘ does not conform with constitutional propriety ’			0
the document , written in 2009 but in use until last week , states that successful permanent secretaries - the most senior official in each department – must ‘ balance ’ the immediate needs and priorities of ministers with ‘ the long - term aims of their department ’			1
they act as ‘ a “ pivot point ” in terms of knowing when to “ serve ” the political agenda and manage ministers ’ expectations , versus leading their department with a strong sense of mission ’ , the document obtained by @entity50 ’s @entity49 said			1
cabinet office minister @entity30 criticised the terms used for the recruitment of top @entity34 mandarins , claiming it ' does not conform with constitutional propriety ' former conservative minister @entity61 said : ‘ i think this is an extraordinary document			2
this is actually beyond a joke			0
‘ we ca n’t have a kind of permanent government of an unelected bureaucracy deciding that it has its own long - term priorities which may be different to those of ministers and elected government			2
‘ and i think this does go to some of the problems that we ’re seeing of a civil service which is sometimes resistant to change			2
’ mr @entity7 claims he was overruled by senior colleagues who amended a key piece of policy advice requested by ministers ahead of the 2011 budget			1
he insists he was adhering to the chancellor ’s wishes by including detail of a tax break for small businesses , which he says enjoyed mr @entity6 ’s support , in his paperwork			0
but his advice was subsequently amended by senior colleagues who allegedly wanted to ‘ kill off the policy wholesale ’			2
managers claimed that @entity93 , a junior treasury minister , was ‘ not keen ’ on the proposal and planned to advice the chancellor against it			0
mr @entity7 said : ‘ i flagged a concern			1
i was worried that some advice to ministers might not be objective – a breach of the civil service code			1
my managers suggested a review , but it never happened because , completely to my surprise , i was suddenly criticised on other grounds and sacked			0
‘ this seemed extraordinary : there was no complaint of incompetence , nor misconduct			0
' so i resorted to an employment tribunal			1
former conservative minister @entity61 said the ' extraordinary document ' was actually beyond a joke ' it confirmed that i had worked well with past managers , that the reason given for dismissal was not the real one , and that i had been dismissed unfairly			2
it ordered i should be given my job back			1
‘ my department has refused			0
it has not appealed against the decision , but the permanent secretary has decided he disagrees with it			0
he ’d rather the department incur whatever sanctions apply than take me back			0
‘ this is surely extraordinary			0
a rogue employer might set aside what the @entity131 justice system has ruled to be fair , but ought a government department do so ? and have public resources , starting with the six - figure compensation payout , been properly spent ? ‘ i had an unblemished career in the civil service			0
i spoke out – politely , through the proper channels – and i ’m now deprived of my career even though a judge has ordered i be reinstated			0
