@entity8 , a mentally disabled man locked up for 14 years , will receive $ 7.85 million for being falsely imprisoned , while @entity9 , who was held for 17 years , is to get $ 4.625 million			1
the payouts come as yet more embarrassment for the agency , which also settled with a man in 2009 after he wrongly spent nine years on death row - and @entity9 said his hefty payout shows the @entity16 is admitting it made a mistake			1
payout : @entity9 , left , will receive $ 4.625 million for being wrongly imprisoned for 17 years for a murder he did not commit , while @entity8 , right , will receive $ 7.85 million for wrongly serving 14 years @entity8 , who has an iq of 50 , was held in a psychiatric hospital for the murder of @entity22 , a retired schoolteacher who was found beaten to death in her home in 1993			1
witnesses said her killer was @entity28 , and officers pulled in @entity8 for questioning , although he did not resemble the suspect			1
no evidence tied him to the case and shortly after it was tested , sheriff 's deputies lost nearly all of the physical evidence , the @entity31 reported			0
nevertheless , he was locked up after an @entity16 agent produced a six - page confession after interrogating @entity8			1
his attorneys said the details were too elaborate for @entity8 to have given			2
moving on : @entity8 was never given a trial as it was deemed he did not have the mental competency deemed necessary to stand trial			1
he is now living with a caretaker and enjoys trips to @entity48 thrown out : the only evidence linking @entity8 , who has an iq of 50 , to the crime was a confession he allegedly gave investigators during an interrogation			1
a judge ruled this was not enough to prove his guilt @entity8 , who has the mental capacity of a seven - year - old , was never brought before a jury as he did not have the mental competency to stand trail			1
he was sent to @entity62 in @entity63			0
but in 2007 , he was freed by @entity65 superior court judge @entity64 , who determined @entity8 's confession was not enough to prove he had killed @entity22			1
he now lives with a caretaker			0
his attorney , @entity68 , said @entity8 likes @entity48 and cleaning and asked to ride in a @entity70 when he returned home			2
his caretaker now drives him around in a used @entity70 , @entity68 said			0

@entity9 was in his 20s when he was jailed for the beating death of @entity77 , who was found bludgeoned and abandoned in a cul - de - sac in @entity63 in 1991			1
mistake : @entity9 was in his 20s when he was convicted of beating @entity77 , right , to death in 1991 lost family : when he was jailed for life , he left behind a young daughter , @entity82 , pictured left the father - of - one spent 17 years locked up in @entity4 prisons until a three - judge panel declared him innocent in 2010			1
during the hearing , witnesses went back on their original statements			2
it came after he was represented by an independent commission concerned with cases of people who maintained their innocence			0
during the hearing , it emerged that an @entity16 lab report said officers found blood in @entity9 's truck			1
but a subsequent test showed it was not human blood - and these results were never reported by the agent			2
it had been the only physical evidence allegedly linking him to the crime			0
since being freed , he has tried to settle back into a normal routine with visits to the gym and to his grandsons			2
when he was locked up , he left behind a daughter , who is now married with two children			0
reunited : @entity9 is pictured left with @entity117 after he was exonerated in 2010 , and right at a family gathering back home : @entity9 is pictured with his daughter , grandson , son - in - law and other family members last year , he told @entity124 : ' you just ca n't undo 17 years in two years , or even five years , maybe			1
you do n't have any future with a life sentence , so you just kind of give up all those hopes , all those aspirations			0
' if i was hopeful of anything today , i would be hopeful to find some purpose for what i 've been through			0
i 'm trying to learn how to be 50 years old when my mind still thinks i 'm 30			2
' @entity9 told the @entity31 he was now looking to the future , but added that the state agreeing to settle is an indication that they wronged him			2
' the fact that they settled speaks for itself , ' he said , adding he will live on the money and use some for a safety net for his daughter and her family			0
locked up : @entity9 walked from @entity145 in @entity63 last year after 17 years behind bars freed : @entity8 was held at a psychiatric hospital , @entity62 , for 14 years before he was released attorney general @entity148 has not acknowledged any wrongdoing by his agents but said it was an opportunity to look forward , thanks to better interrogation methods and lab techniques			1
in the aftermath of the exoneration , @entity155 , the @entity16 agent whose misconduct was central to the ruling , was fired for his actions in other cases			0
special agent @entity162 , who was involved in @entity8 's case , is still employed as a supervisor at the @entity16 on a salary of $ 86,215			2
the settlements are not the first large payouts stemming from @entity16 misconduct , the @entity31 reported			0
