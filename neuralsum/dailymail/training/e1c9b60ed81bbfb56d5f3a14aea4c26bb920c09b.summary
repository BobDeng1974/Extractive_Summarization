but these hardy travellers are happy to laugh off the impending danger of a 2,000ft plunge into a rushing river below them			0
at some points on their dangerous journey , believed to be between @entity14 and @entity15 in the @entity16 of northern @entity17 , barely inches separate the men from a terrifying fall			1
tempting fate : one of the @entity21 passengers leans out of the van to catch a glimpse of the drop below him precarious : at some points the van is just inches from a 2,000ft drop the footage shows the @entity21 travellers tentatively guide their their van along a track carved out of the rock high above the waters of the @entity35 below			1
one passenger , identified only as @entity37 , remains tight - lipped throughout the experience despite being prompted to chime in by the narrator			0
at one point a man referred to as @entity42 , who appears to be a local , steps out of the van in order to survey an overhanging rockface , which the tourists fear may be so low as to stop the vehicle from proceeding			1
the video , uploaded to sharing site @entity50 , invites watch to join the gut - churning spectacle as the camera is pointed over the lip over the road			2
at any especially narrow spot , the men ca n't help tempting fate s they stare into the abyss below with cries of ' @entity61 ' and ' what do you reckon to that drop ? ' sure - footed : a man referred to as @entity42 , who appears to be a local , steps out to test whether the van will fit under the jutting rockface ahead @entity69 territory : at one point the road passes directly under a waterfall they do not seem to have complete confidence in their vehicle either , with one man wondering whether the doors might give way and leave him plunging down the mountainside			2
the stretch , dubbed ' the narrowest we 've been through ' by the passengers , was also described as ' the maddest road i 've ever been down in my life '			2
nonetheless , everybody seemed impressed by the break taking views , despite the danger that came with them			0
one particularly dangerous moment came when the van came close to a waterfall , sheltered only by the lip overhanging their road			1
amusingly , the camerman failed to close his window in time and ended up with a soaked chair .			0

*daredevil* tourists drive , inches from death , along a mountain track
