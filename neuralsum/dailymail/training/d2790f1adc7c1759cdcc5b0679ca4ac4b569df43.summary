by @entity1 reporter when video editor @entity2 decided she wanted to leave @entity5 animator @entity3 , she probably did n't expect that her boss would fire back with his own video			1
in a tongue - in - cheek video response uploaded to @entity11 , employees at the @entity5 animation company performed their own ' interpretive dance ' to @entity14 's ' gone			1
' her boss also had some stern words for her : ' i wish marina would have applied more creativity to her daily work as she did in the video			1
getting their own back : @entity27 's former company have made their own version of the video that states what a great place to work the company is another brunette with glasses : there are parallels between the new video and the one that was posted six days ago showoff : but do they employees have time to enjoy it ? the bosses latest video wishes @entity27 well and announces they are hiring			1
the clip even shows off the company 's rooftop pool in an attempt to entice potential employees into applying for @entity51 's recently vacated position			2
footage courtesy of @entity53 fun place to work : the video shows how wild , wacky and crazy the workers are best wishes : the video wished @entity51 all the best , although her boss has complained that she was n't as creative in her work as she was in the video she posted online job opening : @entity27 's departure means that there is now a vacancy with the company the video makes several referenced to the original and apart from being filmed in the same locations in the office , shows off the facilities to try and set the record straight			1
her boss has also made it clear that he did not find her video funny			1
' i dont agree with everything that she said			2
she said we dont provide a lunch break , but this is @entity83 , @entity5 , not @entity84			2
most people order takeout and eat at their desks			2
' dead of night : the video begins with miss @entity2 setting up a camera in her company 's office at 4.30am dancing time : it then cuts to a shot of her dancing to the music of @entity14 's hit gone backhanded compliment : miss @entity2 says her boss is a ' brilliant writer ' and her ' respect for him is boundless ' just days earlier , ms @entity27 penned a 1,500 - word blog outlining her reasons for her resignation , which she called journalism is @entity108 ( to me )			1
she wrote : ' i work for an awesome company that produces news videos			0
' for almost two years i 've sacrificed my time , energy and relationships for this job , and my boss only cares about quantity and how many views each video gets			1
gripe : tactfully she never names the company for which she worked but pulls few punches in her reasons for wanting out blogged down : and as if the video were not enough , she also penned a 1,500 - word blog outlining her reasons , which she called @entity107 is @entity108 ( to me ) ' so i thought i 'd make one of my own to focus on the content instead of worry about the views			1
' oh , and to let my boss know i quit			0
' on her blog , miss @entity2 , who is from @entity84 , explains further : ' i got a job [ ... ] for an animation company where i was free to make jokes and put my personality into my writing			1
i loved it ! i found the perfect combination between comedy and journalism			0
i was having my cake , eating it and going in for seconds			0
' i dropped everything for work			0
i spent hours in the office perfecting my headlines , my voice overs , my stories			2
ironic ? since posting it online two days ago , her video has had more than 300,000 views ' i 'm gone ' : the video ends with her switching off the light and leaving the office ' but as the workload increased , i found i could no longer keep up			1
i came in earlier , i stayed later , i worked on weekends			0
scared i was nâ€™t pulling my weight , i went to my boss and told him how i felt			0
' " make deadlines , not art , " was his response			2
' after i admitted that i could not hit the deadlines needed to put out our long - form , satirical news pieces , i was moved to our serious stories			0
' but she says she did n't find that fulfilling and decided to leave for a different career			0
she adds : ' running away from something is never the solution			0
unless your problem is a mugger			0
go ! now ! ' but for this particular problem , the solution is rolling up your sleeves , sticking your hands in the motherboard and jostling the wires until things fall into place			0
