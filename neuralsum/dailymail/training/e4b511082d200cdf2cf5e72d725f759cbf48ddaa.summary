by @entity0 published : 19:14 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 19:41 est , 11 march 2014 the state pension age should rise to 70 by 2040 , @entity3 's pension tsar said last night the state pension age should rise to 70 by 2040 – more than 20 years earlier than scheduled under government changes , the country ’s pension tsar said last night			1
at present , a woman can claim her state pension at the age of 62 while men receive theirs from the age of 65			1
ministers have already outlined plans to first align and then increase the ages at which men and women become eligible for the pension - but lord @entity22 said the current timetable should be speeded up even more dramatically			1
under the current plan , the state pension age for women will match men at 65 by 2018 , and then both men and women will rise to 66 by 2020 , 67 by 2028 , 68 by the ‘ mid- 2030s ’ and 69 by the ‘ late - 2040s ’			1
as the state pension age is increased with life expectancy in the future , experts say the government ’s rules indicate it will reach 70 by around 2063			1
speaking in @entity37 last night , former @entity3 @entity36 chairman lord @entity22 said : ‘ i think 70 by 2040 would be a good thing to aim for			1
’ lord @entity22 , who was hired by the @entity40 government to solve the country ’s pensions crisis , also said there is a case for workers to be forced to save into a pension			1
under the current rules , all bosses must pay into a pension for their workers - but workers can ‘ opt out ’ of the scheme , deciding for whatever reason that they do not want to save			2
at the event , organised by the think - tank , @entity55 [ must keep ] , the ex-chairman of the @entity54 said : ‘ there is a case for compulsion			0
’ lord @entity22 urged people to accept that working later in life is often a good , not a bad , thing			1
he said : ‘ for most people , leaving the workforce too early in life is a bad idea			0
people need the social interaction of work			0
’ he added that he believes ‘ 60 is the new 40			0
’ on the prospect of forcing people to save into a pension , he said it was simply not possible to do unless rip - off pension charges are @entity77 describing himself as ‘ open - minded ’ about compulsion , he added : ‘ we can not compel people to save and then start taking money off them			2
state pension age is increased with life expectancy and experts say the government 's rules indicate it will reach 70 by around 2063 ( library image ) ‘ i do n’t think it is ok to compel people to save and then there being any danger of them paying one per cent fees			2
you ’ve got to get it lower than that			0
’ the increasing state pension age represents one of the most dramatic social changes in @entity3 , with millions of people set to work longer than their parents or grandparents			2
for many women , they saw their mother stop work and start claiming her state pension at 60 while they will have to wait a decade longer			0
@entity107 , a senior consultant at the pension advisers @entity109 , said : ‘ making people wait an extra two years to claim saves about £ 15,000 per person , as well as generating more tax revenue if they work longer in response			2
‘ whether that ’s better or worse than cutting the weekly amount [ of state pension ] depends on how long you live for			0
’ last night , a @entity119 spokesman said : ‘ we are making the state pension more sustainable for the future			0
‘ this government had already outlined increases to 68 and have built a mechanism for future reviews which will take account of life expectancy and other factors			0

presently , women can claim pension aged 62 and men at 65
will rise for both men and women to 66 by 2020 and 68 by ' mid 2030s '
lord @entity22 said age should be 70 by 2040 - 20 years earlier than planned
