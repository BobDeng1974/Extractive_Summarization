mission success ! ’ he went on : ' [ the team ] has dug out blind to get here , @entity115 you know , it ’s just remarkable the fact that someone with no legs has made it here , and to have done it in record breaking time , no doubt			0
' and @entity27 as well , when i look across i see him being guided around you know , totally blind , from @entity60 , and absolutely hates the cold , and you know he ’s not doing it for himself , he ’s doing it for his buddies back home , and that goes for everybody , every single one here			0
' it ’s not just for the small minority that are here but hopefully in time to come through the documentary , and all the stories back home			0
' it will just prove to everybody that there ’s so much that can be made possible when you think that nothing is left			0
