@entity0 - shun ! the three leaders ’ wives were on parade yesterday , marching across the country in support of their men , in support of the political party into which they married , in support of desperately important employment issues – keeping their idiot husbands in a job			1
in the corridors of power , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 proved once more that they are the ones who wear the trousers , in more ways than one			1
indeed , @entity14 and @entity15 marched out in almost identical uniforms ; dark slacks and blazers , paired with crisp shirts and sensible shoes			1
they looked like a pair of lady pilots from the budget deficit airline , ready for their long haul flight to or from the land of @entity32 , depending on whose husband wins			1
the only accessory missing were their welfare caps , which they must have left at home			2
badge on lapel , leaflets in hand , smart white loafers tripping lightly over the @entity50 flagstones , she looked every inch the groomed and polished loyal @entity57 wife			2
that was until she visited a @entity60 family for a cup of tea			2
mrs @entity14 respectfully took her shoes off before entering the home of local businessman @entity65 and before anyone could scream : ‘ holy footcream ! ’ she unleashed them			1
out popped a pair of startling tootsies , displaying what might just have been a hint of a bunion			1
all across the @entity76 , fragrant @entity57 women fell into a dead faint			2
for @entity14 ’s seldom seen feet seemed ever so slightly unkempt , unusual from a woman noted for her effortless elegance			1
they did n’t even seem very @entity57 toenails			2
shriek – not even a drop of nail polish ! i do n’t know what the grooming squad will have to say about that , but i doubt it will be very flattering			2
@entity14 put her best foot forward on the campaign trail in west @entity46			1
badge on lapel , leaflets in hand , smart white loafers tripping lightly over the @entity50 flagstones , she looked every inch the groomed and polished loyal @entity57 wife perhaps we should not be too harsh			0
not many women would come out smelling of roses and peppermint foot lotion if they unexpectedly had to reveal their workaday feet , still slightly steaming from punishing the pavements , to the nation			0
yesterday ’s shock unveiling of @entity111 was reminiscent of a moment during the last election , when @entity115 ’s mangled trotters were revealed on a visit to a @entity117			0
the same furore greeted @entity115 ’s podiatric horror story			0
and the message was the same			0
woman goes out in public without painted toenails ? the end of civilisation is nigh			0
if she had unveiled the perfect trimmed pedicure and three glistening coats of @entity130 , she would be accused of being self - indulgent			0
wasting money on luxuries or wandering around with battered trotters			0
but in this election , who can ? @entity15 resolutely wore the exact same outfit she wore last week , sending out a @entity138			1
campaigning in @entity139 , she looked like a grim pixie determined to prove to the @entity141 that her man was the man			0
it was left to @entity16 to show a bit of wackitude , pulling on a huge smile , a pair of @entity151 yellow chinos and a nautical @entity153 top ; she looked like @entity154 reporting for duty on the good ship doomed			1
@entity16 dragged her husband @entity157 along to a cookery lesson at a @entity160 primary school			0
aprons on , they exchanged loving looks as they and the pupils were shown how to make a variety of desserts using apples and blackberries			0
soft fruit , fool , pudding and crumble ? that is the history of the @entity151 right there			1
just a week to go and the wifely bandwagon rolls on			0
their role is to be there , be visible , be bland and say nothing of import			0
in this carefully manicured – if not pedicured – election , the days of loudmouth @entity179 wading in like a docker with gout have long gone			0
today ’s wives must smile nicely			1
today ’s wives must not rock the boat			1
today ’s wives must wear ordinary high street clothes and nothing that hints at their secret , massive wealth – although @entity14 ’s two hundred quid spotty blouse must have slipped under @entity57 central office radar			1
above all , however , today ’s wives must remember that pulling your socks up is not as important as keeping them on .			2

all the party leader *'s* wives have been spotted looking *stylish* in trousers
@entity14 and @entity15 wore almost identical uniforms
@entity203 *lez* was more quirky donning a pair of @entity151 yellow chinos
