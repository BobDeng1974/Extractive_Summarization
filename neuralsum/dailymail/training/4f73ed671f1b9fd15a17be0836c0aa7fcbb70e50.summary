by @entity0 among the flying displays and exhibitors at this year ’s @entity4 , visitors were also treated to a number of high - tech and revolutionary aviation technologies			1
these include a flying buggy prototype , lightweight fuel tanks that collapse and bend , and control sticks that let pilots ‘ feel ’ if their plane has a problem			1
other highlights included the world premiere of the most advanced jet radar , and a @entity18 looping and soaring like a stunt plane			1
it features exhibitions and flying displays			0
@entity26 demonstrated its @entity28 military transport plane ( pictured ) that will operate in cargo transport , troop transport , medical evacuation , aerial refuelling , and electronic surveillance the @entity4 is a biannual event held in @entity22 in july			1
the show moves to @entity36 for the year in between			2
it is now in its 49th year			0

the show moves to @entity36 for the year in @entity41 is now in its 49th year			2
it typically attracts more than 200,000 trade and public visitors over the course of seven days , and this year featured more than 1,600 exhibitors			1
highlights include : @entity50 engineering firm @entity48 showing off its @entity51 flying ' car ' that is a quick as a @entity53 , but can also take to the air			1
the ‘ world premiere ’ of the most advanced @entity61 radar , called the @entity55 , installed on @entity58 prototype @entity56			1
@entity62 ( or @entity63 ) used only by military pilots will soon be available in commercial cockpits			1
@entity62 also announced its stealth @entity66 has successfully completed a second phase of flight testing , flying almost invisible to radar			1
elsewhere , @entity70 presented its latest flexible fuel tanks made from @entity72 and rubber that can bend and morph into complex shapes and tight spaces			0

during this year ’s event , @entity50 engineering firm @entity48 was showing off its flying ' car ' that is a quick as a @entity53 , but can also take to the air			1
the @entity51 is billed as ' part buggy , part aircraft ' and claims to be the ' ultimate recreational vehicle '			1
it is powered by a one litre @entity87 engine that provides 123 brake horsepower and 147lb/ft of torque			0
this gives the unusual vehicle a 0 to 60mph time of just 4.3 seconds - the same as a mid-range @entity92			0
the vehicle can also take off and fly at 55mph ( 88km/h ) in the air			0
the @entity51 goes from buggy to aircraft in around three minutes and can take off on fields , grass strips and secluded beaches			1
when in the air , it uses paraglide technology , in the form of a large parachute - like wing , to reach a maximum altitude of 15,000ft ( 4,750 metres ) , although it is restricted to 10,000ft or 3,000 metres , which is a popular height for a sky dive and can still be above the clouds			0
tuesday saw the ‘ world premiere ’ of what ’s been dubbed the most advanced active electronically scanned array ( @entity61 ) radar , called the @entity55 , installed on @entity58 prototype @entity56			1
the firm announced at the show the radar is now ready to starting testing			2

the @entity61 radar is unique because it combines a wide - field of view , with a repositioner , tilt @entity140 ( @entity141 ) and antenna aperture			0
this gives jet pilots an advantage because it means they can crank and notch 90 degress while keeping keeping the enemy tracked on radar			0
@entity62 used the event to announce cutting - edge technology previously used only by military pilots will soon be available in commercial cockpit			1

the firm 's @entity164 sticks ( pictured ) offers pilots tactile cues that allow them to feel feedback from the plane the controls sticks also provide linking between the two pilots , to increase awareness across the cockpit , and therefore , safety			2
this means pilots ( pictured ) can ' fly by touch ' , which revolutionises how commercial flights will handle plane problems , for example the firm ’s @entity164 ( or @entity63 ) have been used by fighter jets for decades , and offers pilots tactile cues that allow them to feel feedback from the plane , including the way it is being flown and if they are reaching the limits of the aircraft 's capabilities			1
they also provide linking between the two pilots , to increase awareness across the cockpit , and therefore , safety			0
@entity70 presented its latest flexible fuel tanks ( pictured ) made from rubber and @entity72			0
this makes it half the weight of existing designs this means pilots can ‘ fly by touch ’ , which revolutionises how commercial flights will handle plane problems , for example			2
the reduced mechanical complexity of @entity62 ' @entity63 is also said to reduce maintenance costs , and the potential for mechanical failure			2
@entity62 also announced its @entity215 demonstrator @entity214 has successfully completed a second phase of flight testing			1
during tests , @entity214 flew in a fully ‘ stealthy ’ configuration , making it virtually invisible to radar			1
in order to achieve this level of stealth , the team changed all antennas on the aircraft to signature control variants , and the air data boom on the nose of @entity214 was removed			2
following these modifications @entity66 used a specially - designed system that allowed the aircraft to generate a full set of flight data , without the use of an external probe or boom			0
meanwhile , @entity240 firm @entity238 used the international air show as the opportunity to show off its @entity244 drone craft			0
it carried out successful tests in february and is designed to perform intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance missions at 45,000 ft ( 13,700 metres ) @entity214 also used latest stealth communication systems to stay in touch with its mission commander without revealing its position to the enemy			2
elsewhere , @entity70 presented its latest flexible fuel tanks to trade visitors at the @entity4			2
@entity70 is already known for is flexible structures , including @entity261 landing bags , and its latest is a fuel tank that uses two layers of rubber and @entity72			0
@entity62 also announced its @entity215 demonstrator @entity214 has successfully completed a second phase of flight testing			1
during tests , @entity66 ( pictured ) flew in a fully ' stealthy ' configuration , making it virtually invisible to radar @entity214 ( graphic pictured ) is named after the @entity273 god of thunder and designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single - wing stealth design			1
during tests , @entity214 also used latest stealth communications systems to stay in touch with its commander without revealing its position this creates a fuel tank that is half the weight of existing designs			2
it is also self - sealing , can be morphed into complex shapes , and does n’t have the wear and tear seen on metal tanks			0
a video earlier this week also revealed a @entity18 plane rehearsing stunts it is expected to perform to the public this weekend at the show			2
from a terrifying vertical climb after take - off to a series of dramatic turns , pilots @entity295 and @entity297 were shown putting the plane through its paces			0
the moves , which include a turn so tight that the plane almost seems to stand still as it banks around , imitate tricks more associated with a compact fighter jet			0
