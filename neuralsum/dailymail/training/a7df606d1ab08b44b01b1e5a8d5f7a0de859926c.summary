by @entity0 life expectancies across the are increasing , with @entity2 and @entity3 boasting the oldest citizens			1
worldwide , a girl born in 2012 can expect to live to 73 and a boy can expect to live to 68 , according to a new report from the @entity8			1
this is six years longer than the average global life expectancy for a child born in 1990			1
across the globe , life expectancies are increasing with the highest male life expectancy being in @entity2 - 81 - and the highest female life expectancy being in @entity3 - 87 at the top end of the scale , @entity3 women have the highest female life expectancy in the world at 87 , and @entity2 has the highest male life expectancy – 81			1
the next highest female life expectancies were in @entity22 ( 85 ) , @entity23 ( 85 ) , @entity24 ( 85 ) and @entity25 ( also 85 )			2
after @entity2 , the highest male life expectancies were found in @entity23 ( 80 ) , @entity27 ( 80 ) , @entity28 ( 80 ) , and @entity24 ( also 80 )			1
in the @entity31 , life expectancy for a boy born in 2012 is 79 and for a girl it is 83			1
in the @entity35 a boy born in 2012 can expect to live to 76 and a girl can expect to reach 81			1
if all high - income countries are taken together , the average male life expectancy is now 76			1
this is 16 years more than for a boy born in a low - income country , where life expectancy is now 60			1
globally , the leading causes of lost years of life due to premature death are heart disease , lower respiratory infections - such as pneumonia - and strokes worldwide , a girl born in 2012 can expect to live to 73 and a boy can expect to live to 68 but life expectancies in low - income countries remain much lower than those in high - income countries for a girl born in 2012 in a high - income country , life expectancy is 82			1
for a girl born in a low - income country , the figure is just 63			2
‘ in high - income countries , much of the gain in life expectancy is due to success in tackling non-communicable diseases [ i.e. chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes ] , ’ said dr @entity62 , director of the @entity63 at @entity8			2
‘ fewer men and women are dying before they get to their 60th birthday from heart disease and stroke			0
‘ @entity78 countries have become better at monitoring and managing high blood pressure for example			0
’ declining tobacco use is also a key factor in helping people live longer in several countries			0
however , the ‘ @entity87 ’ report shows that the greatest progress was made in low - income countries where average life expectancy increased by nine years between 1990 and 2012			1
in many low - income countries female life expectancy is still held back by high rates of death during childbirth and the greatest increases in life expectancy were in @entity98 ( from 42 years in 1990 to 62 years in 2012 ) , @entity99 ( from 45 to 64 years ) , the @entity103 ( 58 to 77 years ) , @entity100 ( 54 to 72 years ) , @entity101 ( 50 to 66 years ) and @entity102 ( 48 to 65 years )			1
‘ an important reason why global life expectancy has improved so much is that fewer children are dying before their fifth birthday , ’ says dr @entity104 , @entity8 director - general			2
‘ but there is still a major rich - poor divide - people in high - income countries continue to have a much better chance of living longer than people in low - income countries			0
’ the figures also revealed that across the world women live longer than men			0
in high - income countries they live for an average of six years longer , and in low - income countries they live for an average of three years longer			2
at the bottom end of the scale , life expectancy for both men and women is still less than 55 years in nine @entity128 countries – @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137			2
one of the reasons that life expectancies have increased in low - income countries is that infant mortality rates fell significantly between 1990 and 2012 the @entity8 figures also revealed that the top three causes of years of life lost due to premature death are coronary heart disease , lower respiratory infections – such as pneumonia – and strokes			0
however , globally , the greatest causes of death vary			0
in 22 @entity128 countries 70 per cent or more of the years of life lost due to premature death are caused by infectious diseases			0
in contrast , in 47 mostly high - income countries , non-communicable diseases and injuries cause more than 90 per cent of years lost			0
these are diseases that can not be passed between people , such as cancer and heart disease			0
more than 100 countries are transitioning rapidly towards a greater proportion of deaths from non-communicable diseases and injuries			0
most deaths in children under the age of five occur as a result of premature birth			0
the second highest cause of infant mortality is pneumonia .			0

a girl born in 2012 can expect to live to 73 , a boy can expect to live to 68
this is six years longer than the life expectancy for a child born in 1990
@entity3 women have the highest female life expectancy in the world at 87
@entity2 has the highest male life expectancy - the average man lives to 81
@entity31 : life expectancy for a boy born in 2012 is 79 , a girl 83
@entity35 : a boy born in 2012 can expect to live to 76 , a girl 81
