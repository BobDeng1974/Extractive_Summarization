unless , that is , you are a regular on the 7.44am from @entity7 to @entity8 , which was yesterday named the most overcrowded train in the country			1
the @entity12 service carries nearly twice its passenger capacity and tops a league table of shame published by transport minister @entity16 to highlight the top ten most overcrowded train services in @entity18 and @entity19			1
graphic shows the worst train services in the @entity22 in terms of how busy they are top ten according to data collected in autumn 2011			2
the load factor figure is based on 100 % being the normal capacity of the train : 1			2
@entity12 7.44am @entity7 to @entity8 180 % overcrowding , 179 excess passengers 2			1
@entity33 7.32am @entity32 to @entity34 164 % , 471 3			2
@entity35 6.13pm @entity36 to @entity37 new street 162 % , 431 4			0

@entity35 7:14pm @entity47 to @entity34 152 % , 385 10			0
@entity35 5.46pm @entity36 to @entity37 new street 152 % * , 383 * rounded - up figure but slightly lower than the ninth - placed @entity47 service			0
the operator abbreviations are @entity12 - @entity12 ; @entity33 - @entity33 ; @entity35 - @entity51 ; @entity42 - @entity52 ; @entity53			0
some are packing in hundreds more passengers than they were designed to carry			1
the 7.44am from the @entity57 town into the capital has a ‘ load factor ’ of 180 per cent			2
this means it was at 80 per cent over capacity in standard - class carriages when the survey was carried out during autumn 2011			1
as a sting in the tail , passengers are paying through the nose for the privilege			2
from january 2 , @entity7 season ticket holders will see their annual fare rise 4.18 per cent to £ 3,388			1
however , @entity12 did recently add a carriage to the 7.44am , increasing the number of standard class seats to 340			0
the second most crowded service was the @entity33 7.32am service from @entity32 in @entity76 to @entity34 , which was 64 per cent over capacity			1
it carried 471 more passengers than it should			1
third and fourth were two @entity51 evening services from @entity36 to @entity37 – the 6.13pm , which was 62 per cent over capacity , and the 4.48pm at 60 per cent over capacity			1
all other services in the top ten were also at least 50 per cent over capacity			1
transport minister mr @entity16 urged train operators to continue work to tackle congestion on their services			2
mr @entity16 said : ‘ climbing on a crowded train where there is little space can often be an unpleasant experience			0
i will be monitoring these services closely , and others which have not made the top ten list , and urging train companies to reduce crowding on the busiest services			2
’ @entity105 of the @entity106 said : ‘ there is a real danger of cattle class travel becoming the norm on the most congested routes			0
the latest statistics show how much of a problem overcrowding continues to be			0
year after year , fares go up faster than wages yet many passengers find themselves having to stand in cramped conditions			2
’ @entity12 managing director @entity118 said it had added 4,500 extra seats from @entity8			1
the top ten most overcrowded trains in @entity18 and @entity19 were revealed today , shaming the worst offenders at 52 % over capacity , the @entity33 7.14am service from @entity47 in @entity124 to @entity34 was ninth , while the 10th most - crowded service was another @entity8 - @entity37 evening rush - hour service - the 5.46pm @entity36 to @entity37 , which was 52 % over capacity			1
publishing the data was ‘ an important tool to give increased transparency to passengers and help the industry act to improve journeys			0
’ the @entity135 ( @entity135 ) said all train franchises require the train operator to address overcrowding and ‘ to plan their timetables in such a way as to ensure , as far as possible , that crowding is not unduly concentrated on any particular route or individual service			0
‘ it said the ‘ top ten ’ list is based on ‘ load factor ’ , which is defined as the number of standard class passengers on a service expressed as a percentage of the passenger capacity for that service			1
so a train which has the same number of passengers as its official capacity has a ‘ load factor ’ of 100 per cent			1
in a bid to name and shame the worst offenders into action , transport minister @entity16 , pictured , published new @entity161 figures showing the top ten most overcrowded peak - time services the @entity163 also set out the remedies that some of the train companies were taking said of the most over-crowded service			0
it said : ‘ @entity12 has recently strengthened the 07:44 service from @entity7 on @entity170 to @entity8 by adding an additional carriage , so that the number of standard class seats has increased to 340			1
’ it added : ' from this month @entity51 is providing three @entity176 ' high density ' trains for the 18:13 service from @entity8 to @entity37			1
' this is to maximise the number of seats			0
’ in the long term , @entity51 has 10 new 4 car trains on order that will allow them to operate additional trains on this route from 2014			0
’ @entity187 , chief executive of the @entity188 , said : ‘ faster trains and better services are attracting record numbers of people to the railways , but the flipside is overcrowding on some routes			2
train companies understand passengers ' frustration when they can not get a seat and operators are taking action where they can			0

@entity7 to @entity8 services travelling at 80 per cent over capacity
