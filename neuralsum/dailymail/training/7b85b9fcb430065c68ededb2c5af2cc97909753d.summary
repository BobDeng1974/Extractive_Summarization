@entity0 slammed @entity1 for their ' lackadaisical ' performance in the first half at @entity4 - claiming they were not set up to ' play the @entity1 way '			1
fellow @entity7 pundit @entity6 was equally scathing in his criticism of @entity10 's side , stating that @entity11 and @entity12 ' are too similar ' to play together			1
in a poor first half , @entity1 created little and lacked any sort of invention , leading to the duo 's remarks			2
@entity12 ( left ) and @entity11 ( centre ) struggled for @entity1 at @entity19 @entity20 , pictured against @entity4 , and @entity11 were labelled ' lackadaisical ' by @entity0 @entity11 ( left ) and @entity20 ' are too similar to play together ' according to @entity6 speaking on @entity7 , @entity0 said : ' i have not seen the ball fizzed around			1
the movement ( up front ) is lackadaisical			0
' at the other end , ( @entity25 ) @entity24 and ( @entity27 ) @entity26 are moving the @entity1 defence around , but they ( @entity1 ) are stagnant and this is not the @entity1 way			0
' we like to see movement and space created for other players to get into			0
they ( @entity11 and @entity20 ) are easy to play against			1
' in addition to @entity0 's comments , @entity6 was also bemused as to why @entity38 had opted for the duo of @entity11 and @entity20 up front			1
the former @entity41 centre back insisted the @entity1 boss should turn to young striker @entity43 in the second half			2
@entity24 ( right ) attacks for @entity4 against @entity1 - the @entity4 attack was far more dynamic @entity47 ( left ) , tracked by @entity48 , also caused @entity1 a host of problems at @entity19 @entity20 ( centre ) tries to see off the challenge of @entity4 's @entity53 at @entity19 @entity6 said : ' i would make a change and bring @entity43 on			1
i am looking at the lack of movement compared to @entity24 and @entity26			0
' i am not saying these players ( @entity11 and @entity20 ) are bad players , but it is not a partnership			2
' i think they are too similar			0
they have spoken at times about @entity1 â€™s slow play			0
' now , is it down to the passing or is it down to the lack of movement ? that is what they have got to change - they have been world - class strikers but as a partnership it is not working			0
' when you are almost 30 , as those two are , you need a young fella ( like @entity43 ) running around you			0
