by @entity0 for @entity1 from his seat just behind the dug - out , @entity2 saluted @entity5 ’s goalscorers one by one			1
all three had the seal of approval from the club ’s new striker coach			0
their finishes were straight out of the @entity2 locker , taking @entity14 football back to a time when he had the calmest finish in the game			2
he could make it look so easy			2
so did @entity5 , strolling to victory at @entity22 with goals from @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
off to a bad start : @entity24 made matters worse for manager-less @entity30 by giving @entity5 the lead after 34 minutes celebration : @entity24 got @entity5 going at @entity30 on saturday with the opening goal before @entity25 added a second three minutes later daylight between : @entity25 celebrates making it 2 - 0 just three minutes after @entity5 took the lead at @entity22 against @entity30 @entity30 xi : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 ( @entity44 71 ) , @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity47 83 ) , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 ( @entity51 70 ) unused subs : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 goals : @entity49 ( 48 ) @entity58 : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity25 ( @entity65 90 ) , @entity24 ( @entity66 83 ) , @entity67 , @entity26 ( @entity68 68 ) unused subs : @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 goals : @entity24 ( 34 ) , @entity25 ( 37 ) , @entity26 ( 62 ) referee : @entity76 ‘ knowing @entity2 he will probably take all the credit , ’ chuckled @entity77 after his side registered their first @entity80 win of the season			1
at times @entity5 ’s football was a sight to behold , with @entity64 and the outstanding @entity86 zipping the ball into the feet of @entity5 ’s front line			2
it was irresistible to watch			0
@entity2 has been brought into provide some invention , that little bit of craft and guile to open up teams such as @entity30			2
he was that type of player himself , always one step ahead of the game during a stellar career with some of the top teams in @entity14 football			0
@entity24 ’s opener was a beaut , picking a clearance out of the sky to volley @entity5 ahead in the 34th minute			1
it was a special goal			0
so was @entity25 ’s as he drifted in from the right , gliding past @entity30 ’s defence and waited for the moment to bend an effort beyond @entity38			1
they are goals worth watching again and again			0
‘ @entity2 can do little things in groups and he has definitely added something , ’ admitted @entity77			0
‘ the only problem we have is the sports scientists saying he is out there too long with them : “ do n’t get an injury or the muscles will tighten up ... ” ‘ but i do n’t mind him taking all the credit for it if we continue to show the quality of finishes we did against @entity30			2
in a short space of time @entity2 has added another dimension to @entity77 ’s attack , drawing on the creative juices of @entity25 , @entity24 and @entity67			1
they needed it after last season , when the fans were on @entity77 ’s back for 38 games and wanted him out of @entity138			0
but @entity5 had something about them yesterday , purring when they were in possession and always threatening around the edges of the penalty area			2
making his point : @entity2 watched on as his strikers put @entity30 to the sword in the comfortable win at @entity22 decisions : @entity30 co-owner @entity149 must choose his new manager after @entity152 's departure and caretaker manager @entity153 ( right ) is in the running coming out : the teams emerge for the start of play on saturday at @entity22 with the @entity30 home fans looking to give their side a bost battle : @entity43 and @entity67 go for the ball during the 3 - 1 loss for @entity30 on saturday at @entity22 @entity165 here to visit our match zone for all the heat maps and statistics this was poor from @entity30 , a world away from the team that @entity152 built and took to 11th place in the @entity80 last season			1
the worry for interim manager @entity153 is that @entity5 did n’t have to work too hard for this			2
‘ we were lacklustre , ’ he admitted			0
yet he deserved better than this from his players			0
sure they are lacking direction and leadership while the club continue their search for a new manager , but losing @entity185 is no longer an excuse			0
it is time to move on			0
‘ it has been a tough week for the club because we lost @entity152 in the circumstances we did and then everything happened with @entity192 [ @entity193 ] , ’ @entity153 added			0
@entity153 still wants the job full - time and he is due to speak with co-chairman @entity149 today			1
whatever happens , he will take the team to @entity196 for tuesday ’s @entity198 tie			0
he was encouraged , in part , by @entity30 ’s start to the second half , but all the effort and commitment was shortlived			1
with those @entity30 fanatics in the @entity205 demanding more , @entity49 unexpectedly dragged them back into it with a smart goal			1
@entity43 , who had a decent game in @entity30 ’s midfield , sent the ball down the line for @entity45 to steer in the direction of @entity49			1
when it arrived the @entity213 took a touch before drilling an effort that evaded the outstretched hand of @entity5 keeper @entity59			2
given hope : striker @entity49 got @entity30 back in the running with a second - half strike that made it 2 - 1 to the visitors in : @entity49 of palace scores during the @entity80 match against @entity5 at @entity22 to give caretaker manager @entity153 hope of nicking a point back in it : @entity30 edged their way back into the game to make it 2 - 1 with more than 40 minutes left to play but could not inspire a full comeback it is a shame then that @entity30 sat back , inviting pressure and giving @entity5 the chance to finish it off			1
@entity26 had done well against @entity30 ’s defence and his 62nd - minute goal from close range was a reward for his endeavours			1
this time it was route one , a free - kick launched from @entity5 ’s half that @entity30 defender @entity244 failed to adequately clear			1
@entity26 reacted first to beat @entity38 with an emphatic strike			1
‘ everything is going against us at the moment , but this just was n’t good enough , ’ admitted @entity153			0
‘ until you come to matchday , you never quite know what kind of reaction you will get from your players			0
’ on saturday , in his second game in charge since @entity152 left , it was nowhere near good enough			0
settling it : @entity26 makes it 3 - 1 to @entity5 against a @entity30 side whose manager left less than 48 hours before the @entity80 season started that 'll do it : @entity26 slots past @entity30 goalkeeper @entity38 to make it 3 - 1 on saturday afternoon at @entity22 are you not entertained ? @entity26 runs away in celebration with @entity25 behind after putting @entity5 3 - 1 up at @entity22 winner : @entity5 goalkeeper @entity59 celebrates as the @entity5 won 3 - 1 at @entity22 against a crestfallen @entity30 outfit busy : @entity5 's @entity86 was all over the pitch during the win			1
