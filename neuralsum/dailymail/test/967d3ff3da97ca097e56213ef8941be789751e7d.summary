a new study has shown women still have an increased risk of breast cancer years after stopping taking hormone replacement therapy hormone replacement therapy increases a woman 's risk of breast cancer up to eight years after she has stopped treatment , scientists have warned			1
the new findings come from experts who conducted one of the world 's largest studies into the effects of @entity17 - used to ease the effects of menopause			1
the @entity21 in the @entity22 and the @entity23 in the @entity24 have both revealed strong evidence that @entity17 increases a woman 's risk of breast , womb and ovarian cancers			2
the @entity23 , a collaboration between @entity33 and the @entity34 , results suggested that women who are using combined @entity17 have double the risk of breast cancer compared to non-users			1
and researchers found if women use @entity17 for more than 10 years , their risks are even higher			2
now scientists involved in the @entity21 study have warned , after further follow - ups , that women who take the combined oestrogen and progesterone @entity17 therapy continue to have a high risk of breast cancer , up to eight years after they stop treatment			1
after going through the menopause a woman 's ovaries stop producing the hormone oestrogen			0
it triggers menopausal symptoms including hot flashes and mood swings			0
@entity17 treats the body by introducing female sex hormones			0
there are three types , oestrogen - only @entity17 , cyclical @entity17 - where oestrogen is taken continuously but progesterone is given either monthly or every three months - and continuous combined @entity17 , where both female sex hormones are taken at the same time			1
in the early 1990s , some smaller studies suggested the therapy would reduce a woman 's risk of coronary heart disease and osteoporosis			2
to examine whether that was the case , the @entity21 in the @entity22 was tasked with investigating			0
they enrolled more than 26,000 women aged 50 to 79 in the study			0
meanwhile , in the @entity24 another key study , the @entity23 , explored the effects of @entity17 on women aged 50 or over			2
both concluded that women prescribed @entity17 were at a higher risk of breast cancer , than those not receiving the treatment			2
@entity21 researchers had intended to follow the women up until 2005 , but in 2002 it became clear women taking @entity17 were suffering higher rates of heart disease			1
those women who took the combined @entity17 , which boosts the body 's levels of both female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone , have an increased risk of breast cancer up to eight years after treatment they discovered it was the women taking either the combination @entity17 or those taking oestrogen - only treatment that were going on to suffer heart problems			1
as a result , all women were asked to stop taking their treatment - @entity17 or placebo - immediately			1
after the reported increased risk in breast cancer for women taking combined @entity17 , use of the therapy dropped dramatically			1
the new study , led by dr @entity115 , an oncologist at @entity117 , and one of the initial investigators on @entity21 , focused on a woman 's risk of breast cancer after stopping @entity17 treatment			2
he told @entity125 : ' it looks like hormones have longer term lingering effects			0
' for oestrogen and progesterone together , we see an increase in risk - even years after you stop			1
' but for oestrogen alone , it looks like the hormone may be more favourable in reducing breast cancer risk than we thought before			0
' the oestrogen alone findings are now quite compelling that we may have to call it risk reduction			0
' in total , researchers examined 27,347 women aged 50 to 79 years old , who had been through the menopause			0
they had all taken part in two previous @entity21 studies , having enrolled at 40 centres across the @entity22 from 1993 to 1998			0
the @entity21 in the @entity22 and the @entity23 in the @entity24 are the two largest studies into the effects of @entity17			1
both found strong evidence the treatment increases a woman 's risk of breast cancer , pictured , with the latter finding it doubled a woman 's risk in the first two years , after stopping @entity17 treatment , researchers noted a sharp decrease in breast cancer risk in those women who had taken both oestrogen and progesterone			1
but the study authors noted : ' subsequently , breast cancer risk increased throughout the intervention phase and became statistically significant			0
' even up to five - and - a - half years later , breast cancer risk remained high			2
in addition , the researchers note that at an eight - year follow - up a ' risk reduction was not observed '			0
but for those women taking oestrogen only treatment , the risk for invasive breast cancer fell			1
however , despite the findings , dr @entity115 urged caution			0
he said while the results do show a higher than normal risk of breast cancer years after stopping @entity17 , it is only ' a little more risk than we thought with oestrogen and progesterone '			1
' but it 's always difficult to figure out how to categorise that risk , ' he added			0
' it 's different for each woman			0

@entity17 increase risk of disease up to eight years after stopping treatment
applies to those taking combined *hrt* - oestrogen and progesterone
discovery made by scientists from one of largest ever studies into @entity17
but women taking oestrogen - only @entity17 may actually have a reduced risk
