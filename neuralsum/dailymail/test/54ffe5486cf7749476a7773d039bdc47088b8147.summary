@entity0 will be confirmed as @entity2 ’s permanent manager on friday - exactly eight weeks after he was asked to take charge until the end of the season			1
an announcement will be made by the @entity7 club on friday morning , with the former @entity9 boss being given a three - year deal			1
and on thursday the 39 - year - old paid tribute to the players whose efforts have helped him win favour with new chairman @entity16 since he replaced @entity17 on a caretaker basis in february			1
@entity2 will confirm @entity0 as the club 's new permanent manager on friday ‘ i ’d be over the moon to get it as it ’s something i ’ve worked hard towards , ’ said @entity0 while negotiations were being finalised at the @entity23 club			1
‘ i had a taste of it ( management ) at @entity9 and really enjoyed it			2
i ’m fortunate i was put into this position at a great club			1
it ’s a fantastic opportunity			0
‘ but i ’ve said all along , it ’s not about me			0
if they perform , you get a better reputation as a manager and that has been the case here with a great response from them			0
‘ that ’s how football works			0
if they play well , your stock rises			0
equally , if they do n’t play well , it ’s the manager who gets the stick			0
‘ i ’ve got broad shoulders and i know what to expect but i ca n’t praise the players highly enough			1
they have worked so hard and they have taken on board everything i have tried to tell them			0
’ @entity56 and @entity9 player @entity0 , who was crestfallen not to be retained by the @entity58 club as head coach after they were relegated last season , added : ‘ ( @entity63 ) @entity62 and @entity64 have done a fantastic job in helping me , too			1
‘ you ca n’t do all of these things by yourself and backroom staff can be as important as the players			2
i ca n’t thank all of these people enough			0
’ @entity0 , who returned to @entity7 last summer , had been working as no 2 under @entity17 when the manager announced in february that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season , indicating that the £ 150,000 sale of teenage forward @entity76 to @entity77 had been a factor in his decision			1
after @entity17 was immediately relieved of his duties by the club hierarchy , assistant @entity0 was put in charge and was initially regarded as a stop - gap appointment			1
but he quickly won over the players and a team that had previously been struggling in the league went unbeaten in their first six games under his stewardship			1
they only suffered their first reverse under @entity0 when @entity91 beat them 2 - 1 in @entity93 two weeks ago			1
@entity2 went unbeaten during @entity0 's first six games in charge of the club he has impressed @entity16 not only with results but with the way he has conducted himself during his two months at the helm			1
@entity2 are currently eighth in the @entity100 and still remain in the hunt for a top - six place			1
it was expected that @entity0 would have been appointed permanently before now , but he dismissed reports that talks had stalled due to a clause that would see him sacked if the club failed to achieve a top - six finish this season			1
‘ when you are dealing with contracts , they take a bit of time and i certainly do n’t foresee any problems , ’ he said			0
‘ there has n’t really been a hold - up			2
as any player or manager will tell you , when it comes to the terms of a contract , it does n’t just happen overnight			0
there are a lot of things to discuss and i have done that			0
‘ i will keep all that private because that is the way it should be and the club have dealt with it brilliantly			2
‘ i ’ve no complaints there , so i hope it will be sorted before saturday and i can concentrate on our home game against @entity137			0
‘ our new board of directors have been fantastic			0
i ’ve been really impressed with the way that they have handled everything			0
the club itself is trying to be as positive as possible			2
‘ there are a lot of plans in place to make the club even better than it is right now , so there are loads of positives and i would like to be part of that			2
’ having resolved his own situation , @entity0 will next week turn his attention to the futures of nine first - team players at @entity2 — @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 — who will become free agents this summer			1
‘ i ’ve said for a number of weeks now that once my own position was sorted out , there are a few players out of contract and they will want to know what their futures are , ’ he said			2
‘ so it will be great to get moving on all of that and prepare for next season			0
‘ you ca n’t do that until you are the main man			0
