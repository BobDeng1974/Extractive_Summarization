by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:54 est , 24 december 2013 @entity2 : 12:44 est , 24 december 2013 a woman nearing her 40th birthday has completed an incredible list of dreams and challenges after vowing to turn a negative life experience into a positive			1
@entity9 , now 40 , from @entity10 , @entity11 , found new love following divorce from a childless marriage			1
but hopes to start a family with her new husband were dashed when she was faced the devastating discovery she was unable to have children of her own			2
with her 40th birthday approaching , @entity9 decided to turn her misfortune into a positive , vowing to experience everything she had ever wanted to do - so she created a ‘ bucket list ’ of 40 activities and challenges for herself			1
the challenges also involved travel , including an all - nighter in @entity53 , revisiting @entity54 and skinny dipping in @entity30			2
@entity9 explains that the purpose of the list , which she nicknamed her ‘ fab - u - list ’ was to offset the hardships she had faced in her life			1
‘ i ’d got married at 19 but after a few years we drifted apart , realising we ’d been too young			0
‘ after my divorce i was alone for a while , then i met @entity63 at a squash club			2
‘ we got on instantly - i also became an instant step - mum to his two boys , @entity68 then 13 and @entity69 , then 10			2
‘ life with @entity63 and the kids was fun			0
and after a couple of years , when i was 30 , @entity63 proposed in @entity54 and we married two years later			0
she then went on to complete the national 3 peaks just before taking a glider flight over the @entity75 ‘ i had a steady life and job in sales - but there was something missing			1
although i loved @entity63 ’s boys dearly , i also yearned for children of my own			2
‘ when nothing happened we dug into our life savings and embarked on @entity86			0
it was a slow process which took its toll on our finances and our emotions and when it failed we were disappointed			0
but luckily we were a strong couple			0
@entity9 admits that after her experiences , she was not looking forward to turning 40			1
@entity9 attempting clay pigeon shooting			1
she says ' with every event came a sense of achievement and fun ' ' this was after my first wild camp ; seeing the sunrise from the top of a mountain ' ‘ by now i ’d just turned 39 , the big 4 - 0 was approaching			2
i ’d always been an optimist , but it had been a big knock and like some of my friends the usual insecurities were also creeping in			0
‘ then one day me and a friend were chatting about walking around @entity72 and @entity110			0
it hit me that the old cliche is true : life is n't a dress rehearsal and i had to make the most of it			2
‘ i began thinking about all the things i wanted to achieve and came up with 40 challenges to complete by the time i hit 40			1
@entity9 busking with her friend , @entity120 , who @entity9 says : ' agreed to help whilst sober ! ' @entity9 vowed to complete her list before she turned 40 , doing unusual things such as learning the art of trapeze @entity126 way through running the @entity128 marathon , which @entity9 had vowed to do dressed as @entity129 @entity9 , pictured here learning archery , constructed the list based on all the things she wished to achieve in her life some of @entity9 's list was made up of luxury experiences such as tea at the @entity137 in @entity128 ‘ it was a bit like a bucket list , except i was n't planning on dying any time soon , so instead it became my fab - u - list of wishes i wanted to come true , ’ @entity9 explains			1
however , even her family were sceptical that @entity9 would be able to complete the ambitious list in a year			1
‘ ‘ you ’ll never do all that @entity148 , ’ the boys cried incredulously , ’ @entity9 says , ‘ even @entity63 raised his eyebrows			1
@entity9 , pictured learning to pole dance says : ' rather than freaking out at 40 i feel fabulous ' @entity9 enjoyed lunch at the exclusive @entity155 restaurant where he meal was cooked for her by renowned chef @entity157 @entity9 and husband @entity158 in @entity53 on her 40th birthday watching the sunset			1
they then went into @entity163 to dance all night but @entity9 was determined to complete the challenge she had set herself			1
‘ in august last year , in between work , i set about embarking on the list			0
‘ some things i paid for , others i blagged my way in			0
‘ with some i even resorted to bribery - trading my home made cakes for the abseil			0
‘ but with every event came a sense of achievement and fun			0
and each experience gave me a precious and unique memory			0
i even wrote a blog about each adventure and soon family , friends and colleagues were hooked			0
some of @entity9 's list were experience things she had missed out on in her youth , such as attending hrer first festival at @entity189 @entity9 went round the @entity191 course on the @entity192 as a pillion ( passenger who sits behind the rider ) @entity9 tried out the ancient art of knife throwing as part of her list @entity9 moments before doing her first abseil ‘ ‘ what are you doing next ? ’ they ’d ask , even my customers joined in			1
some also said i ’d inspired them to try new things too			0
as she hit 40 , @entity9 had managed to achieve all but 6 of her list , ticking off another on her birthday itself			1
‘ in june this year a month before my 40th i could n’t believe how many i ’d achieved and when the big day came round i ticked off another on my list - an all nighter in @entity53 as me and @entity63 stayed up and partied at cafe @entity213 , then watched the dawn rise			2
‘ during the last four months i 've achieved another four things on my list and now i ’ve only got one thing left to do , a ‘ helicopter ride , which i ’ll achieve in the spring			0
‘ but rather than freaking out at 40 i feel fabulous - what ’s more i ’m glad i ’ve inspired a few others along the way ! ’ @entity9 before going on the longest zip wire in the country 1 @entity225 with friend to make enough money for lunch 2 @entity229 3 @entity230 4 @entity231 turn 5 abseiling 6 tt on the back of motorbike 7 drive a super car 8 @entity236 9 do the @entity238 3 peaks 10 @entity240 climbing @entity241 at @entity155 12 @entity243 special brownies 13 pose naked for an arty photo shoot @entity246 ride over the @entity247 15 drink expensive fine wine 16 camping in the wild and seeing the dawn 17 an all nighter in @entity53 @entity253 the @entity254 as @entity129 19 @entity255 to @entity256 walk 20 drive a @entity258 21 @entity259 22 learn to belly dance 23 have a @entity262 wax @entity263 at a festival 25 revisit @entity54 26 ride on the @entity266 27 glider flight 28 afternoon tea at the @entity137 29 learn the trapeze 30 drive a tank 31 learn archery 32 learn to knife throw 33 enter a cake competition 34 skinny dip in @entity30 35 @entity276 pigeon shoot 36 @entity278 ’s @entity277 37 pot making 38 have a food fight 39 photocopy my boobs 40 go on the longest zip wire in the country			1
