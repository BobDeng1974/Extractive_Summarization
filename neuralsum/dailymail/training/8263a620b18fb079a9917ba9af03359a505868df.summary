two @entity1 tourists have died in the @entity2 after snorting what is believed to have been white heroin that was sold to them as cocaine			1
the men aged 20 and 21 were found dead in an @entity9 hotel room after taking a deadly batch of drugs just days after @entity2 police stopped issuing warnings to holidaymakers			1
the @entity16 is liaising with @entity2 authorities and is ' providing consular assistance to the family ' , a spokesman said two @entity1 tourists have died in @entity9 ( file picture ) after snorting what is believed to have been white heroin sold to them as cocaine one @entity1 visitor has died and 14 other tourists - mainly from the @entity1 – have been taken ill in recent weeks after snorting white heroin which is being sold as cocaine			1
@entity29 spokesman @entity28 said the bodies of the two men , both from @entity32 , were found next to traces of a white powder			1
the men 's names have not yet been released by officials			0
a post-mortem examination is due to be conducted later this week to confirm the time and cause of their deaths			0
' we did a quick test to find out what kind of powder it was			0
it was n't cocaine , it was an opiate - in this case , white heroin , ' mr van der @entity28 said			1
' we took the sample to the @entity2 forensic institute and they found out that the contents of this material is the same contents as other material that we already seized in other cases where people got sick			2
' he said investigators believe the men were targeted by the same street dealer , or ring of dealers , involved in the death of another @entity65 last month @entity9 police had launched a major public alert targeted at visitors from @entity1 , many of whom view taking drugs as a big part of the city ’s attraction , including @entity77 - language matrix - style signs reading : ‘ extremely dangerous cocaine is sold to tourists			1
’ but after no cases for more than a fortnight , the authorities ended the alert at the weekend – meaning the two @entity1 found dead in their hotel room on tuesday after apparently snorting the drug may have been unaware of the warning			1
police in the city have now urgently resumed their awareness campaign , putting up posters in hotels and hostels and handing out fliers			0
there have been at least 14 other cases , although until this week ’s tragedy all were found in the street , meaning passers - by were able to raise the alarm			0
@entity29 spokesman @entity28 said the bodies of the two men , both from @entity32 , were found next to traces of a white powder in a hotel in @entity9 ( file picture ) police blame a rogue dealer who is selling white heroin – regarded as a ‘ luxury ’ version of the drug , which is normally brown - tinged – as cocaine to unsuspecting @entity77 - speaking visitors			1
no arrests have been made , but they believe the dealer is unaware as he is selling at cocaine prices , rather than white heroin which is more expensive			1
the double tragedy comes a month after a 22 - year - old @entity1 tourst died after apparently taking cocaine and heroin on a trip to @entity9			1
@entity123 was taken by ambulance to a hospital in the city , but discharged himself before he was treated			0
officers found him nearby and took him to a police station , where he had to be resuscitated			0
he was then taken back to hospital , but later died			0
mr @entity28 added : ‘ the last such incident was two - and - a - half weeks ago , so we hoped he was through the merchandise and stopped the alerts at the weekend			0
‘ the other cases were people found in the street , but unfortunately these men were staying in a hotel so nobody was aware of what had happened until staff found their bodies			2
’ leaflets handed out to visitors since last month at main squares and @entity9 's @entity148 railway station warn : ‘ the last couple of weeks several tourists were hospitalized with severe health problems after using cocaine bought on the street			2
‘ research has revealed that the cocaine used was not cocaine but white heroin			2
’ they add that in @entity9 ‘ you wo n't be arrested for taking drugs ’			0
a @entity161 report named @entity9 and @entity162 as @entity164 ’s top cities for cocaine use based on analysis of urine in sewage , the equivalent to 1.5 grams per day per 1,000 people .			2
