by @entity0 published : 12:45 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 15:48 est , 24 january 2013 the discovery of a new feathered dinosaur will change the way we look at birds forever , scientists claimed today			1
the fossil of a 30cm long creature from the @entity10 period is set to challenge widely accepted views on the origin of flight			2
in a groundbreaking study , experts have revealed how the @entity16 roamed the earth long before the bird - like beasts it was thought birds evolved from			1
how @entity16 might have looked : scientists studying the fossilised remains of the new dinosaur say its discovery will rewrite theories of how birds evolved the ability to fly scientists previously believed that birds evolved from dinosaurs called theropods from the early @entity34 period , about 120 - 130million years ago			1
but recent discoveries in north - eastern @entity36 of much older feathered dinosaurs from the older middle - late jurassic period have cast doubt on the old theory			2
the @entity16 would have been around on @entity41 more than 145million years ago			1
dr @entity42 , senior lecturer in @entity44 at the @entity45 , @entity46 , co-wrote a report on the exciting findings			0
he said : ' this discovery sheds further doubt on the theory that the famous fossil archaeopteryx - or " first bird " as it is sometimes referred to - was pivotal in the evolution of modern birds			1
' our findings suggest that the origin of flight was much more complex than previously thought			0
' an artist 's impression of @entity62 : dr @entity42 , of the @entity45 , says the study casts doubt on this creature 's role in the evolution of flight the fossilised remains found in north - eastern @entity36 indicate that , while feathered , this was a flightless dinosaur , because of its small wingspan and a bone structure that would have restricted its ability to flap its wings			0
the dinosaur also had toes suited to walking along the ground and fewer feathers on its tail and lower legs , which would have made it easier to run			0
dr @entity42 is based at the @entity83 , @entity84			0
he worked on the report , published in the journal @entity87 this week , with fellow experts from @entity89 and @entity36 .			0
