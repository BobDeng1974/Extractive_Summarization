by @entity0 and @entity1 at @entity4 's @entity3 , scientists are growing noses , ears and blood vessels in the laboratory in a bold attempt to make body parts using stem cells			1
it is among several labs around the world , including in the @entity15 , that are working on the futuristic idea of growing custom - made organs in the lab. only a handful of patients have received the @entity23 lab - made organs so far - including tear ducts , blood vessels and windpipes			1
but researchers hope they will soon be able to transplant more types of body parts into patients , including what would be the world 's first nose made partly from stem cells			1
scientists added a solution to the mould of the nose to mimic the sponge - like texture of the real thing			2
stem cells were taken from the patient 's fat and grown in the lab for two weeks before being used to cover the scaffold ' it 's like making a cake , ' said professor @entity35 at @entity53 , the scientist leading the effort			1
' we just use a different kind of oven			0
' during a recent visit to his lab , professor @entity35 showed off a sophisticated machine used to make moulds from a polymer material for various organs			2
last year , he and his team made a nose for a @entity23 man who lost his to cancer			2
scientists added a salt and sugar solution to the mould of the nose to mimic the somewhat sponge - like texture of the real thing			2
stem cells were taken from the patient 's fat and grown in the lab for two weeks before being used to cover the nose scaffold			1
later , the nose was implanted into the man 's forearm so that skin would grow to cover it			2
dr @entity87 ( pictured ) said ears are harder to make than noses because you have to get all the contours right and the skin is pulled tight so you see its entire structure			0
she is a plastic surgeon who has made dozens of ears and noses in professor @entity35 's lab professor @entity35 said he and his team are waiting for approval from regulatory authorities to transfer the nose onto the patient 's face but could n't say when that might happen			1
the potential applications of lab - made organs appear so promising even the @entity107 is getting involved : professor @entity35 's work is being showcased on tuesday as mayor @entity109 announces a new initiative to attract investment to @entity23 's health and science sectors			1
a @entity23 businessman who lost his nose to cancer is growing a new one – in his arm			0
if all goes well it will eventually be removed and sewn on to his face , with experts at @entity53 hoping he will have feeling and a sense of smell			0
the new nose , the first in the world to be grown from scratch , will also look just like the 56 - year - old man ’s old one – slightly crooked			2
@entity53 scientist professor @entity35 , who is behind the pioneering treatment , said : ‘ his nose was a little bit bent to the left and we asked if he wanted it straight but he said no , he wanted it exactly the same			0
’ the new nose began as a glass mould , based on the original , which was sprayed with a synthetic honeycomb - like material to create a framework for stem cells to cling to			1
the mould was then removed and the honey - comb covered with millions of these ‘ blank cells ’ which , with the right nutrients , can turn into the cartilage of the nose – a process which took place at @entity53 in a rotating jar called a bioreactor			2
meanwhile , the skin on the man ’s arm was gradually stretched by a small balloon placed under the surface and inflated until it was loose enough to accommodate the nose			0
professor @entity161 hopes to eventually grow a whole face in the lab and says procedure could help car crash victims and wounded soldiers			0
a synthetic polymer nose , left , and ear are shown at a research facility in the @entity3 in @entity4 the polymer material used for his organ scaffolds has been patented and professor @entity35 has also applied for patents for their blood vessels , tear ducts and windpipe			1
he and his team are creating other organs including coronary arteries and ears			2
later this year , a trial is scheduled to start in @entity183 and @entity4 to test lab - made ears for people born without them			1
' ears are harder to make than noses because you have to get all the contours right and the skin is pulled tight so you see its entire structure , ' said dr @entity87 , a plastic surgeon who has made dozens of ears and noses in professor @entity35 's lab. dr @entity87 , a plastic research fellow , demonstrates seeding stem cells onto a synthetic polymer ear professor @entity35 described the process by saying : ' it 's like making a cake			1
we just use a different kind of oven			0
' here he is pictured with the advanced ' oven ' with an artificial windpipe inside it the new body part begins as a glass mould , based on the original , which is sprayed with a synthetic honeycomb - like material to create a framework for stem cells to cling to			1
the mould is then removed and the honey - comb covered with millions of ‘ blank cells ’ which , with the right nutrients , can turn into the cartilage of the organ			0
meanwhile , the skin on another area of the body is gradually stretched by a small balloon placed under the surface and inflated until it is loose enough to accommodate the organ			0
after several months , the body part is taken out from under the skin and sewn into the right place			0
' at the moment , children who need new ears have to go through a really invasive procedure involving taking cartilage from their ribs , ' dr @entity230 said			0
she added that taking fat cells from patients ' abdomens to add to a lab - made ear scaffold would be far easier than the multiple procedures often necessary to carve an ear from their ribs			1
dr @entity230 said they plan to eventually create an entirely synthetic face but must first prove their polymer scaffolds wo n't accidentally burst out of the skin			0
' scientists have to get things like noses and ears right before we can move onto something like a kidney , lungs or a liver , which is much more complicated , ' said @entity257 , a stem cell expert at @entity259 , who is not involved in @entity35 's research			2
professor @entity35 in his office at his research facility in the @entity3 in north @entity4 ' where @entity35 has led is in showing us maybe we do n't need to have the absolutely perfect tissue for a ( lab - made ) organ to work , ' she said			1
' what he has created is the correct structure and the fact that it 's good enough for his patients to have a functional ( windpipe ) , tear duct , etc. is pretty amazing			0
' some scientists predicted certain lab - made organs will soon cease to be experimental			1
' i 'm convinced engineered organs are going to be on the market soon , ' said @entity279 , a professor of transplantation biology at the @entity281 in @entity282			0
she has transferred lab - made blood vessels into a handful of patients and plans to offer them more widely by 2016 , pending regulatory approval			1
still , she acknowledged doctors will have to watch closely for any long - term side effects , including the possibility of a higher cancer risk			0
professor @entity35 estimated about £ 10 million ( $ 16 million ) has gone into his research since 2005 but said he hoped lab - made organs would one day be available for a few hundred dollars			1
' if people are not that fussy , we could manufacture different sizes of noses so the surgeon could choose a size and tailor it for patients before implanting it , ' he said			0
' people think your nose is very individual and personal but this is something that we could mass produce like in a factory one day			0

@entity4 's @entity3 is among several in the world that are working on the futuristic idea of growing custom - made organs in the lab
few have received the lab - made organs so far - including ears and windpipes - but researchers hope they will soon transplant more
they hope to transplant world 's first nose made partly from stem cells
