by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 : 05:42 est , 23 december 2013 @entity3 : 16:32 est , 23 december 2013 this is all that remains of a high - performance car after it crashed into a lorry and erupted into a fireball , killing the three men inside			1
such was the intensity of the blaze that the car was reduced to this lump of molten metal			2
police are investigating whether the car was racing a @entity18 , when the crash happened in the early hours of yesterday on @entity21 ’s @entity20 near @entity22			1
extinguish : a fireman works to put out the burning wreckage of the car the two men in the @entity18 were later arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving			1
eyewitnesses told how they tried to reach the men in the @entity31 as it was consumed by flames , but were beaten back by the intense heat			1
last night there were suggestions the @entity31 may have been fitted with a nitrous oxide kit to make it go faster , a modification used by some of the cars in the @entity41 film series			1
@entity42 , star of the films , was killed in a high - speed car crash in @entity45 last month			1
two of the dead men were understood to be in their early twenties , while the third man is said to be in his early thirties			2
the three victims are thought to have all been men			2
a second car , a @entity18 , was also involved in the crash and two men have been taken to hospital with minor injuries			1
one was discharged and then arrested			2
the second was also arrested but remains in hospital			2
the lorry driver also received minor injuries smash : this horrifying picture shows the ' fireball ' crash which killed three in the early hours of this morning tragedy : the remains of the car , left , and the lorry , right , could still be seen on the road until around 8am according to some reports , the car may have been fitted with a nitrous oxide kit to make it go faster - in the style of the cars in @entity77			1
police said this afternoon they are having difficulty formally identifying the three people killed due to the nature of their injuries			1
they believe they know the identities of the deceased but can not issue details until they have confirmation			0
only then after next of kin have been told will they release the names and ages of the three			0
claims : one witness has suggested the car could have been fitted with @entity98 gas - which makes the vehicle go much faster than it is usually capable of wreckage : fire service members , pictured around the remains of the car , work to clear the road death : police are struggling to identify the victims of the crash as their bodies are so badly burnt @entity109 , 72 , who lives opposite the scene , said the road has been long - plagued by boy - racers speeding down the road at speeds of 100mph			1
describing the crash mr @entity109 said : ' i had been in bed and when i heard a really loud band and thought it must be the cars crashing			2
' i ran to see what was happening and when i saw the car was on fire i tried to help with fire extinguishers			2
' but we could n’t get close enough to the car because of the flames and it was just so hot			1
it really was a terrible sight because we knew they were in the car and knew they were burning			1
emergency : fire crews , ambulance and police at the scene of the collision in @entity21 ' two cars were racing			2
one hit the other , which hit the curb of the central reservation and it went over to the other side of the road			1
' a lorry was coming in the opposite direction and it hit the car head to head before it went up in flames			1
we had to wait for the emergency services to arrive because we just could n’t do anything			0
' the impact of the head - on collision with the lorry caused the car to be crushed to a quarter of its size , and then it was surrounded in hot , orange flames			1
i have never seen anything like it before			0
' it made me jump when i heard the impact , but i knew it would have been the cars we heard racing			2
' it was not a pretty sight and is such a waste of life			2
i feel bad for the families , especially this close to @entity174			0
it ’s lucky that no one was standing at the bus stop			0
' he added : ' we have this problem every night with boy - racers			2
my son called the police even before the impact - he heard the screeching of the brakes and the engines revving and the cars racing			2
scene : the passengers of the @entity31 were killed when they smashed into a reservation on the @entity20 , pictured , before colliding with the lorry ' i have complained many times about this racing and have suggested a speed limit or cameras but nobody listens			1
' every night they are here doing 80 , 90 , 100 miles and hour			2
it was only a matter of time before something like this happened			0
' the road was supposed to be improved to accommodate more cars , but this has just caused more problems			0
mr @entity109 ’s son @entity205 , 47 , who was visiting his parents from @entity207 , said : ' there were at least two cars that were racing , three guys in one and i think one guy in the other car			2

' a local businessman has written to transport bosses warning them of speeding drivers on the stretch of road where three men were killed in a crash last night			1
@entity235 , who runs the @entity237 cafe opposite the bus stop that the lorry crashed into , said he had written to @entity240 and @entity241 warning them of the perils of the road			0
he said : ' i have sent letters from solicitors to @entity240 and @entity241 telling them about this racing and asking them to do something , but nobody listens and they think i 'm mad			0
' all the time there are boys in their cars and on motorbikes speeding past here , sometime more than 100 miles an hour			0
' fireball ' : the driver of the lorry , pictured being removed from the scene this morning , suffered minor injuries ' i told @entity240 and @entity241 it was a death trap			0
there have been other crashes here before but nothing this serious or horrible - maybe now somebody will listen to me			0
' nitrous oxide ( @entity267 ) is a chemical compound used as an oxidizing agent in engines			1
it increases the internal combustion in an engine by allowing more fuel to be burned that normal by introducing more oxygen			0
this propels the car forward at a greater speed than it is usually capable of			0
usually a kit , which can be bought online or through specialists , improves car power by 30 - 50 per cent and costs around £ 400 to install			0
it is perfectly legal to drive cars with nitrous fitted - but many conventional insurers will not cover cars that have the modification			1
nitrous - fitted cars feature heavily in @entity77 films			1
they are often in car - racing video games such as @entity294 also			0
mr @entity235 added : ' they have moved the bollards that were outside and if the bus stop had n't been there the cars and lorry would have come straight into my shop			0
' it 's just not safe enough and they drive so fast			0
all they need is a speed camera to slow people down			0
the changes to the roads have only made it worse between the two sets of traffic lights			0
' some witnesses are reported to have suggested the car was equipped with a nitrous oxide kit			1
