by @entity0 published : 09:45 est , 27 september 2013 updated : 11:16 est , 27 september 2013 @entity1 has dismissed criticisms from @entity3 who said that she is ' kind of done ' with talk of the @entity7 governor as a possible @entity9 presidential candidate			1
@entity1 was asked about the comments that the younger @entity3 made about him in a recent @entity13 interview and he brushed them away , saying that they meant nothing to him			1
' people i have respect for , who critique me , i respond to ... but i 'm not going to respond to somebody just because of their last name , ' he said during a radio interview			0
fighting words : @entity1 said that @entity3 's comments were ' ridiculous and sophomoric ' @entity3 is the daughter of @entity28 senator @entity28 who ran against @entity29 in 2008			1
she has regularly spoken and written about politics and is now starring in her own reality show			0
' if @entity28 wants to say something to me , happy to respond to something @entity28 says			0
@entity3 has no standing to be critiquing me , other than as a citizen , and as a citizen since she does n't live in @entity7 , i 'm not responding to her critique , ' @entity1 said to @entity39			1
' it 's so ridiculous and sophomoric that i have no response to @entity3			2
' she was interviewed by @entity43 on tuesday and weighed in on the prospective field of @entity9 presidential candidates for 2016			2
famous name : @entity0 was a regular on the 2008 campaign trail with her father when he was running for president too close for comfort : @entity3 said that he spoke about himself too much in the @entity53 speech , while others have had problems with his closeness to democrats like @entity58 ( seen here together on wednesday ) ' i used to love @entity1 , i 'm kind of done with @entity1 right now , ' the 28 - year - old said			1
her biggest point of concern appears to be his keynote speech at the @entity64 where he was criticized for failing to talk at length about then - candidate @entity66			0
' ( @entity1 ) just talked about himself the entire time and i think politicians obviously there 's some level of self - promotion that you have to do , but i would like the next leader of the @entity9 and the next nominee to maybe be a little more interested in helping the country than just their platform , ' she said during the @entity13 interview			1
she said that she was talking about the frontrunners with her father 's former campaign manager during his recent 77th birthday party and the unidentified aide suggested she support @entity86 , the brother of the younger president @entity87 and the former governor of @entity89			0
' they said point to @entity86 but i still think the @entity87 name is pretty tainted and i think he is much more conservative than people really realize , ' she said			0
' i like @entity94 , i do n't really know			0
' the war of words did n't stop there and after hearing @entity1 's comments , @entity0 she took to @entity100 and had it out			2
' regarding @entity1 - i have respect for him as a politician , he is just not my first choice in a hypothetical 2016 run , ' she said to her nearly 250,000 followers			1
' if i am so " ridiculous " why is my opinion and name being brought up in interviews ? ' and for the record , any @entity113 citizen in this country has the right to criticize any politician they want , it 's part of the deal , sir			0
' there 's nothing better than a woman in her twenties giving her opinion and being dismissed as " ridiculous and sophomoric " - good politics			2

@entity3 said that she no *longer* loves @entity1 because he was too self - promoting during his speech at the @entity53
the @entity7 governor is *largely* considered a @entity9 2016 frontrunner
he said that her comments were ' ridiculous and sophomoric '
