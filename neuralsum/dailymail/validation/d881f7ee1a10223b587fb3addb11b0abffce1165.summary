it is a pioneer of ' affordable luxury '			1
but the expected price tag on one of @entity5 's new watches is far from wallet - friendly			1
at $ 10,000 , the 18 - carat gold , sapphire and crystal @entity9 being launched on monday would be the firm 's most expensive product since the $ 10,000 @entity14 computer in 1983 , developed by @entity15 , which was poorly received			1
it is the first new innovation to come from @entity5 since @entity15 died in 2011 , and will be unveiled by chief executive @entity17 on monday			2
analysts have branded the move a clear attempt to segway into @entity21 's booming luxury goods market - and suggest it could be the start of an entirely new market			1
this is unprecedented , ' @entity42 , chief technology analyst for @entity43 , told @entity45			1
' i think this is @entity5 flexing its muscles , moving into a space that it potentially has all to itself			0
' the question is : how big is that market ? is @entity5 eating into the market or making it bigger ? ' i think they will make it grow			2
' @entity17 is expected to explain in detail how customers will use the buttons on the side of the device to operate the apps on the screen like an @entity62			0
at the other end of the spectrum , customers can opt for a midrange watch or an ' entry - level ' @entity68 , starting at $ 349 - a fraction of most watch prices on the market			2
@entity73 's @entity72 will set shoppers back $ 72,000			2
the @entity75 costs an eye - watering $ 373,720			0
the move into this market comes months after @entity5 poached @entity80 's ceo @entity79 to be the new senior vice president of retail and sales - and lend a fashionable eye			1
alongside @entity91 's @entity90 , as a ' special projects ' vice president , and designer @entity89 , as a part - time consultant , the team has masterminded the firm 's unprecedented move			1
big move : the products will be the first new innovations to come from @entity5 since @entity15 died in 2011 wearables : analysts say the shift into wearables will be a major breakthrough for the firm targeting @entity103 in october , a prototype of the @entity105 even appeared at @entity106			1
however , some have speculated that without a solid grounding in the high - end retail market , the @entity108 could suffer the same flaws as most iphones , which cease to efficiently function after a few years			0
but according to @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 at @entity119 in @entity120 , the details of the edition model that have been released look promising			0
she told @entity45 : ' @entity5 produces good design , and i hate to say it but good design is priceless			1
' from what i have seen , the gold watch has a very elegant profile			0
the very slight curve shows that the design has been very well studied to fit on your wrist			0
i am curious to see how it actually feels			0
' i would n't be surprised if customers have the option of keeping the strap and the casing but updating the software , which would create loyalty and longevity			0
' @entity116 , who also lectures on product and fashion design at @entity141 , notes that @entity5 is following the classic launch strategy of designer brands like @entity144 , which uses pricing to carve a position in the market			1
' @entity144 targets a broad market and in order to maintain the air of luxury increases the prices often very steeply			0
shoe - in : @entity5 poached @entity80 's ceo @entity79 to help make a play for the fashion world fashionable : @entity91 's @entity90 ( left ) and designer @entity156 ( right ) also worked on it ' if the watch is $ 10,000 , it would be a great way for @entity5 to differentiate itself from the gadget - based market , which is highly competitive			1
' in my opinion , @entity5 is very well positioned to make the transition to move up			2
' if successful , the @entity105 could act as a springboard for @entity5 to rocket into its bulls - eye : @entity103			2
@entity17 has repeatedly remarked that he predicts @entity103 to eventually overtake @entity167 as their biggest market			0
the popularity of the @entity62 drove the firm 's market share in @entity103 to a record high , reaching 25.4 per cent by january 2015 - clouding out @entity173 as the country 's second - largest seller			1
however , @entity176 - widely dubbed ' the @entity5 of @entity103 ' - remains firm with 27.6 per cent of the market			1
venturing into watches and potentially other wearables , with @entity180 at the helm , could be the leap that clinches it			0
@entity42 said : ' they could really move into anything - necklaces , bracelets , brooches ... it 's not clear how those might feature a screen to function in the way that a watch does			0
but @entity5 is certainly in a position to try			0

@entity9 is set to be priced at $ 10,000 on monday 's launch
18 - carat gold , sapphire and crystal product would be firm 's most expensive item since 1983
it is @entity5 's first move from affordable luxury into the luxury goods market
technology analyst and luxury goods analyst both tell @entity45 they are *confident* the product has the potential to succeed in the market
