by @entity0 published : 12:48 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 09:33 est , 15 november 2012 former @entity2 lap dancer @entity1 , 29 , is fighting against a bid to get an employment tribunal ruling overturned a former @entity2 lap dancer performed for ' wages ' so poor she often ended up with less money than she started after a night 's work , it was heard today			1
@entity1 's working terms while dancing at @entity2 and @entity12 clubs in @entity13 were allegedly so miserly she ' often ' ended up out of pocket or empty - handed at the end of the night			1
the 29 - year - old won a landmark legal battle in april , becoming the first stripper to successfully claim employee status and sue for unfair dismissal			1
but now @entity2 are seeking to have that ruling overturned , arguing she could not have been an employee because her working terms were such that she was ' often ' actually paying the club to let her to strip there , rather than vice-versa , @entity13 's @entity21 heard			1
a vital step on the way to mounting an unfair dismissal claim was the @entity32 's ( @entity32 ) recognition that she was indeed an ' employee ' of @entity34 , something which they had vehemently denied			2
miss @entity1 , of @entity36 , west @entity13 , was to seek up to £ 63,000 in compensation when her case went back to the original tribunal			1
she worked at @entity2 and @entity12 clubs in @entity13 during 2007 and 2008			1
@entity41 , for @entity2 , said his clients had ' no wage / work bargain ' with @entity44 , of @entity36 , @entity13 , because the terms under which she worked were such that she sometimes ended up out of pocket after working a full night			1
' on the nights when she was dancing at the club , she danced for the customers and they paid her			1
stringfellows had no obligation to provide her with work or to pay her anything , ' the @entity52 said			0
' on the contrary she had to pay the club a fee of £ 65 to dance there , plus commission on her earnings from customers , plus fines for breaches of club rules , plus a tip out fee to the house mother , such that miss @entity1 often did n’t make any money or made a loss on a night ’s work			1
stringfellows are arguing they had no wage / work bargain with the lap dancer ' there therefore was no wage / work bargain between the parties such as is required for employed status , ' added the barrister			2
' she was free to take as much or as little holiday as she chose			0
she was free to chose whether or not to work			0
she was also free to work for a competitor			0
there were not the mutual obligations and the @entity85 ought to interfere			0
' @entity86 , for @entity44 , told the judges : ' she worked for @entity2 as a dancer			2
there was a contract between them			0
' @entity2 ’ business is the provision of adult entertainment to its customers , in the form of female dancers such as miss @entity1 who dance clothed , semi-clothed and nude both on stage and in private booths			1
' the dancers receive payment for doing so			0
the dancers also sit and talk to customers for payment			0
@entity2 ’ business depends upon the work of women dancers like @entity44 on every occasion on which their premises are open for business			2
' the work of dancers like @entity44 generates a substantial part of @entity2 ’ revenue ... ( they ) are an integral part of @entity2 ’ business , without which it could not function			2
' addressing the claim that little or no wages meant no employment contract , he concluded : ' these days it is not uncommon for people to agree to work for no pay , to gain work experience for example			0
' she could agree to dance to @entity2 ’ tune , if that allowed her to dance at the club to enhance her reputation , to keep her hand in , or for networking			1
' @entity129 , hearing the appeal with @entity131 and @entity132 , found some of what he heard today puzzling			0
telling the court about his understanding of the day to day life of a @entity138 , he said : ' i am gradually getting filled in on the duties of laptop dancers			0
the punters pay for their happy vouchers and they are stuck in the girl ’s garter , and then she goes off to the cashier and says here ’s my vouchers , give me my money			2
' miss @entity1 , 29,had claimed she was wrongly fired by the @entity151 nightclub in december 2008 over allegations of drug dealing			1
the @entity21 hearing continues .			0

@entity1 , 29 , won landmark legal battle in april where she successfully claimed employee status
miss @entity1 paid £ 65 a night to @entity2 but ended up out of pocket if the club was quiet and punters *refused* to tip
