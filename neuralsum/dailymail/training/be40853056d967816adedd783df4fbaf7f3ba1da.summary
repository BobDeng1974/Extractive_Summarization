should @entity1 have any hope of snatching the @entity4 title away from @entity5 , it will require goals , goals , points , and some more goals			1
@entity10 and @entity11 have answered that call all season – but a surprising set of statistics shows those from the @entity18 striker have proven more valuable			2
@entity19 must be beaten at @entity20 for @entity22 ' side to maintain their challenge and for that the @entity26 strikeforce have to be on form			0
@entity10 has scored more @entity4 goals this campaign than @entity11 – 30 to 20 – and the @entity42 also finds the net more frequently – with a goal every 92.8 minutes , compared with 105.5 minutes			1
but the @entity18 star 's goals have engineered more points and arrived in more desperate scenarios			2
five of his 20 have come when @entity1 were behind in a match , while , quite remarkably , @entity10 has managed that only once			2
unstoppable : the @entity42 has been crowned @entity37 and @entity51 this season strike : @entity10 scores his first of four goals against @entity55 at @entity56 in december lofted : @entity11 executes a delightful chip to round off a win over @entity59 at @entity56 further , when you subtract @entity11 ’s goals from final scorelines it shows they have accounted for 18 points			1
for @entity10 , that tally is 15 points			1
so despite playing fewer minutes ( 2,110 to 2,784 ) , @entity11 has had greater impact in this aspect			0
@entity70 to this is @entity11 ’s ability to perform against the division ’s bigger teams			0
clearly , @entity10 is no slouch but the average position of teams he has scored against is 14th in the table , while for @entity11 it is 11th			2
@entity11 has also scored a significantly higher proportion of his goals against @entity1 ’s direct rivals with 20 per cent of his total coming against teams in the top six			1
for @entity10 , who failed to score against @entity5 , @entity87 , or @entity88 this season , that figure is 16.7 per cent			0
on terms : @entity11 , pictured scoring at @entity92 , has been invaluable to @entity1 with his goals opposition : @entity10 will face @entity18 when he lines up for @entity94 at the @entity95 we need goals : @entity22 knows his team need a rout or hope @entity5 drop points @entity10 is often asked to play deeper that his partner in tight games , perhaps accounting for a drop - off , and even so , he has 12 assists to @entity11 ’s seven			1
@entity22 will not care how the goals come against @entity19 , he will be well aware @entity106 has made his side notoriously hard to break down			0
trailing @entity5 by a goal difference of nine means that only a rout will give them a chance if @entity5 keep winning			0
these numbers show it may be @entity11 , rather than @entity10 , who seizes the initiative .			0

@entity10 's goals have won a total of 15 points for @entity1 so far this season
this is three less than @entity11 , who has earned 18 points
the @entity37 has played *674* minutes more
@entity11 also averages more goals against teams higher in the @entity4 table
