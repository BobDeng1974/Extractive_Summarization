a primary school headmaster has quit his post suddenly , claiming the bureaucracy of a ' faceless government ' has left him unable to focus on his job			1
@entity5 , 52 , head of @entity6 , @entity7 , said he could not continue because he was constantly ' frustrated by having to tick boxes and jump through hoops '			1
the headteacher , who has held his post for four years , made the announcement in a letter to parents on friday			1
resigned : mr @entity5 , pictured outside @entity6 , @entity7 , announced his move in a letter sent home to parents on friday			1
he blamed ' faceless government ' bureaucracy for the move mr @entity5 said that , irrespective of which party is in government , headteachers were being ' constrained ' to what they ' can and ca n't do '			1
he added that government rules meant members of staff were left ' constantly stressed and exhausted by the huge amount of paperwork which they are required to complete '			1
it comes nearly a year after his school , which has 584 boys and girls aged from 3 - 11 , was handed a ' requires improvement ' @entity35 grade			1
the report found that teaching ' was not consistently good across the school ' and that pupils ' ' achievement is not good '			2
it added that targets set by the school 's leadership team are ' not focused ' , leading to confusion as to whether improvements are helping pupils			1
a monitoring inspection , carried out since then found that some improvements were being made			2
quit : mr @entity5 said there was no definitive date for when he would be leaving the school , pictured above mr @entity5 said that while the result was ' not the only reason ' for his decision , it had ' made him realise ' that schools are ' solely judged on children 's progress '			1
last year three headteachers left @entity7 primary schools because of ' significant challenges ' posed by changes to @entity35 inspections - which are now conducted as more frequent , but shorter visits			1
in the letter , which was also published on the school 's website , mr @entity5 wrote : ' the role of a headteacher in modern @entity72 is completely different to what it was and i constantly find myself frustrated by having to tick boxes and jump through hoops for a faceless government who do not understand what providing wonderful , creative learning opportunities for children is all about			1
new head : @entity84 is working with school governors to find a ' suitably experienced replacement ' for mr @entity5 in a ' timely fashion ' ' i therefore feel that i can not continue in the role of a headteacher			2
' whilst our @entity35 inspection was not the only reason for my decision , it certainly made me realise that irrespective of which government is in power , schools are solely judged by children 's progress and that headteachers in particular will be constrained with regard to what they can and ca n't do			1
' mr @entity5 , a former headteacher of @entity105 , said no definite date had been set for when he would leave but he has requested it is before the end of the academic year			2
he said he ' could not continue ' in the role of headteacher but is due to stay in education			0
@entity111 , headteacher of nearby @entity112 in @entity113 , @entity7 , said mr @entity5 's letter gave a ' bleak picture ' of leading a school which he said can be a ' very lonely ' job			1
mr @entity111 said : ' it fits with the national picture that both at primary and secondaries more headteachers are thinking about stepping down and it can be incredibly difficult to recruit people			0
' he said work was under way to strengthen the support network which is in place through the @entity129			0

inspection : mr @entity5 's resignation comes a year after his school , which has 584 boys and girls aged from 3 - 11 , was handed a ' requires improvement ' @entity35 grade last year			1
above , an extract of the report @entity141 , headteacher at @entity142 in @entity113 , said being a headteacher carried a large responsibility			0
she said : ' teaching and being a headteacher has a heavy workload			0
it 's also a very important job and it 's right that there is strong accountability			0
' i would not say there 's more work now than there was five years ago			0
' she added that , while staff worked hard , she would not say they are ' stressed and exhausted '			1
mr @entity5 's resignation comes after three headteachers left @entity7 primary schools because of ' significant challenges ' posed by changes to @entity35 inspections			1
@entity164 , @entity84 's cabinet member for education and skills , said : ' we wish mr @entity5 the best in his future endeavours			2
' following his decision to resign , our priority is to work with the school 's governors to ensure that @entity6 receives the support it needs to find a suitably experienced replacement head teacher in a timely fashion			2
' the @entity177 said in a statement : ' we want to support the profession to tackle the issue of unnecessary and unproductive workload , which many teachers are concerned about and is stopping them from giving time to what really matters - inspiring young people to achieve their potential			0
' that is why we launched the @entity187			0
' we received over 44,000 responses and are now acting on those to ensure teachers are able to carry on with their fantastic work and prepare pupils for life in modern @entity72			2
' mr @entity5 's letter to parents : ' to all parents , carers and children at @entity6 , ' i am writing to you today to tell you that after a great deal of soul searching , i have decided to resign from my position as headteacher here at @entity6			1
' it is not a decision i have made lightly ; this is a fantastic school , with wonderful , talented children , inspirational staff , supportive parents and proactive , challenging governors			1
' i would like to take this opportunity to explain to you why i am leaving the school ; please do understand that i am not leaving to take up another headship elsewhere , i am leaving headship completely			0
' the role of a headteacher in modern @entity72 is completely different to what it was and i constantly find myself frustrated by having to tick boxes and jump through hoops for a faceless government who do not understand what providing wonderful , creative learning opportunities for children is all about			1
' i therefore feel that i can not continue in the role of a headteacher			0
' whilst our @entity35 inspection was not the only reason for my decision , it certainly made me realise that irrespective of which government is in power , schools are solely judged by children 's progress and that headteachers in particular will be constrained with regard to what they can and ca n't do			1
' @entity6 has many wonderful , talented staff ; good , conscientious people who are constantly stressed and exhausted by the huge amount of paperwork which they are required to complete			1
' i consider myself to be a very approachable , honest headteacher and when staff ask me how to achieve a better work / life balance , i can no longer give them an answer			0
' after much soul searching , i am going to put my family and myself first			0
' please do be assured that i will work hard to lead the school as effectively as possible in the coming months , until i leave			0
' i was offered a new job on wednesday february 4 and telephoned @entity257 ( chair of governors ) straight away in order to allow governors and senior leaders the time and opportunity to ensure that the children 's education would not be jeopardised in any way at all			0
' however , in light of the change in circumstances , a deputy headteacher was not appointed yesterday			0
' as i write this letter , i am aware that @entity257 is meeting senior leaders at @entity84 in order to ensure that the school does not suffer in any way at all			2
' please do be assured that the school governors are incredibly astute and aware of their responsibilities with regard to your children and that they will now work tirelessly to advertise for and appoint my successor			0
' the senior leadership team have already met to draw up an action plan with regard to the future of the school and i would ask you to trust them as they ensure that " life at @entity290 carries on as normal "			0
' i have enjoyed four years here at this fabulous school and am so proud of everything and everyone connected to it			0
' i appreciate that some of you will be shocked , surprised and disappointed by my letter and i hope that you will discuss my leaving with your super children explaining that they have not done anything to warrant this , but , mr @entity5 has decided that headship is no longer the job for him			2
' i hope that in the coming weeks and months many of you will take the time to chat to me and please do feel free to discuss the contents of this letter with me			0
' ( as i write this letter , i am not exactly sure when i will be leaving as the governors will need to ensure they have a competent , experienced headteacher in place first before they can consider my request to leave before the end of the academic year )			2
' i hope and trust that this letter has begun to explain the reasons why i have decided to leave headship ; as mentioned previously , it has not been an easy decision to make and i have made it with a heavy heart and have suffered many , many dark nights			2
' thank you all so much for your fantastic support during the last four years and thank you for allowing me , as headteacher to lead a school where we have almost 600 wonderful , fabulous children			0
