the influx of high - tech digital speed cameras has seen the the number of motorists trapped surge to 115,000 in the last year - the highest number since 2009			1
@entity6 figures show that a total of 115,549 motorists were fined at least £ 100 pounds by magistrates after being caught speeding			1
the increase has been put down to the £ 10,000 digital cameras , that no longer require film and can operate 24 hours a day , the @entity10 reported			2
the introduction of high - tech speed cameras has seen the number of motorists trapped surge to 115,000 @entity19 in the last year @entity20 has seen one of the biggest increases , with the number of people fined tripling last year to 6,491 , from 2,181 three years earlier			1
the number of offenders has also grown in that period by almost 1,000 in both @entity28 and @entity29 , and by close to 2,000 in @entity30			1
while @entity34 saw the most people fined last year , the figure for the @entity33 area has fallen to 7,736 - its lowest level in five years			1
those convicted of a speeding offence must pay a minimum of £ 100 and will have three penalty points added to their licences			0
the total number of motorists caught speeding is believed to be far higher , as the figures only take into account those summoned to court for failure to pay fines and where speed was particularly excessive			1

' they ( speed cameras ) do not measure whether the driver is under the influence of drink or drugs or how roadworthy their vehicle is			0
what about the other aspects ? ' the number of motorist caught speeding has reached its highest figure in four years @entity123 president @entity122 said the introduction of digital cameras mean the devices are now working all day long			2
he told the @entity10 newspaper : ' it ( the rise in speeding fines ) is a reflection that cameras are more efficient than ever			2
' in the past , cameras in @entity34 they would only take valid pictures for a quarter of day and it was pot luck whether you are fined			2
the cameras are now working 24 hours a day			0
' last week the @entity138 said in the future the speed at which cars can travel may be altered to fit the driver 's experience , and the development of driverless cars may mean an end to speeding			0
' within 15 years , we predict that the performance of cars could be altered to fit the driver , ' the institution said			0
' @entity152 may become a thing of the past as cars are likely to be fitted with speed - limiting devices			0
' this year this year a speed camera in @entity158 generated more than an estimated £ 800,000 worth of fines in just six months			0
according to road safety group @entity98 , the device on the junction of the city 's @entity162 and @entity164 caught 13,624 speeding motorists and a further 146 running red lights between january and june			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity169 said : ' speeding can have devastating consequences and it 's right that drivers should abide by the speed limit			0
these fines were issued at the discretion of the magistrates and show the number of fines issued is in decline across many police force areas			1
