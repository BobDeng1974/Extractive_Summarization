by @entity0 an official photography firm for university graduation ceremonies is offering students the chance to airbrush their pictures to make them looker ' slimmer and healthier '			1
@entity7 offers appearance - conscious graduates a celebrity - style digital makeover to reduce the effect of what is calls ' bulky and unflattering ' academic gowns			1
but students have hit out at the £ 9.95 service , branding it another form of ' fat - shaming '			1
students have criticised a photography company who offered them the chance to ' touch - up ' their graduation photos to make them look ' healthier and slimmer ' the @entity25 - based company 's website gives students three options for manipulating their pictures ; ' complexion touch - up ' for £ 9.95 , ' @entity28 and @entity29 ' for £ 7.95 and ' @entity30 ' for £ 9.95			1
the second option allows students to ' remove all imperfections such as blemishes , redness and shine , leaving skin looking smooth and healthy '			1
the ' @entity30 ' option reads : ' the traditional graduation gown is a mark of respect and achievement			1
however it can be bulky and unflattering			0
' with advanced digital technology we can reduce the gown 's appearance , making it more fitting to your shape			1
' @entity50 and @entity52 student @entity51 took to @entity53 to complain about the company , who were covering her graduation ceremony at the @entity57			2
she said : ' i can pay £ 9.95 to have my graduation pictures photoshopped to make me look thinner : ( literally , what ? you 're wearing a giant billowing cloak			1
' the company 's website offers students the chance to have their complexion ' touched - up ' to reduce blemishes another £ 9.95 option appeals to graduates concerned their academic gowns are ' bulky and unflattering ' speaking to student newspaper @entity72 , another graduate , who finished his degree at the same university , said : ' surely this is a bad joke ? ' they 've squeezed us for every penny , with rising fees and rent , forcing many students such as myself to adopt an unhealthy lifestyle of cheap food because that 's all we can afford			1
' and on our final day they 're asking for another tenner to remove the weight i 've put on because i 've not been able to afford fresh fruit and veg			0
this is just another example of fat - shaming			1
' the company describe themselves as the ' leading graduation photography specialist ' and are employed by several higher education institutions including @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			2
they have insisted the service is not meant to make people look thinner			1
they tweeted : ' just to make clear " digital slimming " refers to reducing the appearance of the gown only , never the individual			2
' students have mocked the service online , joking that any weight they have put on is due to their budget diet a series of leaked photos have shown how the images of celebrities appearing in adverts and photoshoots have often been manipulated			2
in 2004 , actress @entity126 complained after her body was altered in a poster for hit film @entity129			2
she said ' those things certainly were n't mine ' after photos showed the size of her bust had been digitally increased			0
@entity126 was left angry after an image of her in the poster for @entity129 was altered in the studio a photoshoot involving @entity138 was also digitally altered to give the model a thinner waistline in 2008 , leaked pictures showed model @entity138 's body had also been airbrushed during a fashion photoshoot			0
the altered version of the picture showed her with a narrower chin and more make - up			0
the touched - up picture also seemed to have removed some flesh from her already slim thighs and added some definition to her upper body			0
in 2010 , @entity155 released pre-airbrushed images from a shoot she took part in for fashion firm @entity159			0
@entity160 @entity155 released un-edited photos of herself in 2010 to show the pressure women are under the singer made the move in order to highlight the pressure exerted on women to look perfect			0
so - called ' imperfections ' that can be seen in the un-airbrushed shot , such as blemishes on her calf , are removed in the altered version			0
the size of her thighs and waist were also changed using computers			0
earlier this week , website @entity179 published before and after pictures of @entity182 from a photoshoot			0
the singer 's appearance ( below ) was clearly altered to make her appear slimmer and more tanned .			0
