@entity2 , whose weight peaked at an unbelievable 56 pounds just over a year ago , also had to undergo surgery in order to remove all of the excess skin left behind after he dropped the weight			1

' he now can go up and down the steps , ' she told local news station @entity39			0

' puppy eyes : the cute canine first began putting on weight when he was left in the care of his owner 's uncle @entity57 and happy : these days , @entity2 is much more content with his lifestyle and loves running around in the garden and being active then and now : less than a year ago , @entity2 weighed 29 pounds , and was suffering with a huge amount of excess skin , caused by his weight loss ( @entity63 )			1
he underwent a procedure to remove it just a few months ago ( @entity65 ) the devoted pet owner credits an intensive exercise program and incredibly strict diet plan as being the main reasons behind her dog 's dramatic weight loss - and she hopes that other people will be able to find inspiration in what she has done for her canine , and repeat the same success with their own animals			1
