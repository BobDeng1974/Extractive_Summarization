two @entity1 police officers found themselves operating slightly outside of their job description this morning when a woman in labour arrived at the station for assistance			1
constable @entity7 and senior constable @entity8 quickly rushed to the assistance of the woman who had entered her final stages of labour en route to the hospital			1
the woman 's husband and toddler son looked on as the woman gave birth in the middle of the station car park , much to the surprise of the assisting officers			2
sergeant @entity21 said that the officers had just started their morning shift when the woman came in			2
surprised @entity24 constables delivered a baby girl this morning at @entity26 ' this is an unusual event , but a nice way to start the day , ' said sergeant @entity21			1
' the woman had been screaming at her husband to pull over , telling him that the baby was coming now , ' ' i 've been doing this job for 36 years , and while this kind of thing happens every now and then , it 's not normally happening at the actual station , ' ' it 's nice to do something positive to assist the local community '			1
sergeant @entity21 said that @entity41 and senior constable @entity8 were a bit shocked when the woman came in , but their training quickly kicked in			2
the officers quickly sprung into action to help deliver the baby girl ' they went straight into training mode , ' said sergeant @entity21			1
' we 're all qualified in senior first aid , and of course they took into account the welfare of the mother and child			2
' the baby girl was delivered via a normal birth but was found not to be breathing			1
' we offered reassurance to the mother , and had @entity63 on the phone , ' ' they were excellent and provided all the instructions the constables needed to help her			1
' the baby girl and her mother were taken to @entity71 for monitoring the constables checked the baby 's airways and the girl was soon breathing			1
an ambulance arrived from @entity78 and the mother and her new baby girl were taken to @entity71 for monitoring			1
@entity24 have dealt with a similar situation before in the rural town of @entity83			0
in 1997 @entity85 's son @entity84 was born at the @entity86 when she was sent home from the hospital after being induced at about midnight			2
' after dropping off my daughter to my mothers house , i insisted on continuing on to hospital which was about 25 minutes away , ' ms. @entity85 said			2
' my mother begged me to stay and offered to call and ambulance but i was in second stage labour and only focused on getting to hospital , ' ' when i passed the police station in @entity86 , i needed to push so i yelled to my husband that he needed to pull over			1
the police station was the only thing open at 2am ! ' ms. @entity85 had four police officers helping her through the stressful process , for which she is incredibly thankful			0
' i had some stroking my hair and saying reassuring words , and others ready for action			0
gloves and a blanket came out and i would have been there less than five minutes before my son was born in the car			0
the ambulance arrived about five minutes later and we went on to the hospital , ' she said			0
' i saw on the news the next day how absolutely chuffed the officers were at being involved in the birth of my son			0
i am forever grateful to them '			0
while babies decide when and where they will come , sergeant @entity21 was certainly not expecting one on his shift			0
' i 've seen a lot of things in my years , ' said sergeant @entity21			0
' but nothing like this			0
nobody to my knowledge has ever given birth at the station before '			0
the baby girl and her mother have been reported to be doing well and resting normally			1
