off the roads : the entire city was eerily quiet during the lockdown , that remained for most of friday looming : residents anxiously awaited a conclusion of the manhunt so they could go outside unusual sight : more than a million people were told to stay in their homes and not go to work helpful : the governor said the ' shelter in place ' order was used so police could quickly mobilize and track the suspect flights into @entity2 's @entity97 are still being permitted to land , but the passengers will have a lot of trouble getting into the city given the lockdown			1
