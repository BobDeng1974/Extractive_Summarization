close : the former @entity6 crime editor @entity7 , left , told the @entity1 today that former @entity3 counter-terrorism chief @entity2 , right , was a guest at her wedding ' mr @entity2 falls into that category			1
i certainly got on well with him			0
i had a good rapport with him			0
' but we did n’t socialise outside of work			0
the wedding was the only occasion			2
' ms @entity7 added that mr @entity2 attended the wedding of fellow crime reporter @entity32 , who worked for the @entity33 from 1992 until he retired in 2008			1
ms @entity7 was told by a news editor to ' call in all those bottles of champagne ' to get inside information about a terrorist plot from mr @entity2 in october 2010 , the press standards inquiry has heard			1
but the former @entity6 crime editor said this was just ' banter ' from one of her bosses , insisting : ' there were no bottles of champagne			1
' she said : ' i think he was putting pressure on me to get a story			2
wedding : @entity7 said mr @entity2 was just one of ' many ' police officers of all ranks who were guests when she married a @entity3 detective ' i would call that banter			1
it ’s a way that people spoke to each other in our office			0
' she added : ' i think they hoped that we would be able to ring these people up and bring in exclusives every week			0
' the reality is they know that does n’t happen , unfortunately , otherwise we would have had bigger and better crime stories than we did			0
' my recollection of this is that i did phone mr @entity2 , and i do n’t believe i actually got to speak to him			1
that was the reality , week in , week out			0
' ms @entity7 also played down the significance of former @entity3 communications chief @entity77 letting her use his office computer and personal email account to file a story about controversial ex-police commander @entity81 in february 2010			1
under pressure : ms @entity7 also played down the significance of former @entity3 communications chief @entity77 , pictured , letting her use his office computer to file a story she said she was under pressure to send her article to her news editors so it could be edited for that weekend ’s paper			1
' in the olden days i think people used to knock on doors - strangers , random residents - to use telephones when they were under pressure , ' she told the hearing			2

' the inquiry has heard that former @entity105 assistant commissioner @entity104 spent £ 47 on a bottle of @entity108 champagne while drinking with a female @entity6 journalist at the @entity111 restaurant in @entity112 on the evening of february 1 , 2007			2

' the former crime editor told the inquiry she found it ' rather bizarre ' that there seemed to be so much interest in whether or not she drank champagne			1
she said in a written statement : ' i enjoy champagne but do not drink it often			0
' i have two children , meaning i was trying to get pregnant , pregnant and breast feeding for a large amount of the time of the period in question , so therefore was unable to drink much alcohol for much of the period in question			0
' i believe that a distorted picture has been presented of how journalists carry out their business			0
' we do not live a champagne lifestyle and the reality of the day - to - day grind of journalism is far from glamorous			0
' other crime journalists and i work hard in a fast moving business covering often horrendous crimes , to help bring the culprits to justice and break stories that are of public interest			0
' ms @entity7 , who is married to a @entity3 detective , was arrested in december on suspicion of making corrupt payments to police officers			1
she was later bailed and has not been charged .			0
