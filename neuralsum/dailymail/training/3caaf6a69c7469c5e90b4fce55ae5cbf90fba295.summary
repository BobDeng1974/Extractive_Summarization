@entity0 , the rock - ribbed conservative @entity1 senator who figures to be a factor in the 2016 @entity4 presidential election , told thousands of conservatives thursday morning that the @entity6 should go the way of the dodo			1
' we need to abolish the @entity6 , ' he said , calling instead for a flat income tax rate and a user - friendly tax return that can be filed on a postcard			1
that verbal gauntlet , thrown as much at a near - century of tax collection as at the @entity16 administration , was @entity0 's biggest applause line			1
' by virtue of your being here today , ' he jokingly cautioned the nation 's largest annual gathering of politically conservative activists , ' tomorrow each and every one of you is going to be audited by the @entity6			2
' on wednesday the former @entity6 official in charge of vetting nonprofit groups that seek tax - exempt charitable status refused , for the second time , to tell a congressional committee what she knew about the scandal			2
more than 200 right - wing organizations , mostly those linked to the tea party movement , sat in limbo for as many as three years while the @entity6 dithered and held them up during two election cycles			1
the agency is now moving toward new regulations that would allow it to codify the secret rules it used to screen out conservative organizations while quickly green - lighting liberals			0
during a @entity70 sunday interview with @entity72 host @entity71 , president @entity16 insisted that there was ' not even a smidgen of corruption ' in his administration related to the controversy			1
channeling a character in the 1987 cult classic movie @entity80 , @entity0 mocked the president for his choice of words			1
' you keep on using this word , ' he said , referring to ' smidgen			0
' ' i do not think it means what you think it means			0
' the @entity41 , held near @entity44 in suburban @entity91 , will host a cavalcade of right - wing speakers , many of whom are likely to run for president in 2016			0
in his own back yard : president @entity16 is under withing attacks as the annual @entity41 gets underway near @entity44 the @entity41 brings together a mishmash of military and foreign policy hawks , evangelical christians , college @entity104 activists , campaign strategists and media organizations every year @entity0 seemed to be tightening and road - testing a stump speech himself , advocating for the repeal of the @entity112 banking law , safeguards to buttress the @entity115 's gun rights , expanding school choice , permanently banning former members of @entity118 from lobbying their old colleagues , instituting term limits for federal legislators , and auditing the @entity122			1
that line drew a rousing shout from acolytes of former @entity1 rep. @entity126 , a one - time perennial presidential candidate whose libertarian following has picked up with @entity126 's son , @entity129 sen. @entity128 , right where it left off			1
@entity0 knows that he must appeal to that subset of the @entity104 , which opposes government surveillance programs as well as centralized control of the @entity4 money supply			0
he asked everyone in the audience with a cell phone to ' please leave them on			0
i want to make sure president @entity16 hears everything i have to say			2
' but the @entity104 's more traditional conservatives are his meat and potatoes crowd			0
leading off the first day of the @entity41 convention , he nearly brought a giant ballroom to its feet with a demand that @entity118 must ' repeal every single word of @entity152			2
' former @entity6 official @entity47 ( @entity153 ) refused wednesday to answer questions from @entity118 about the tea party targeting scandal ; @entity158 sen. @entity157 ( r ) said thursday that @entity4 ' need to stand up to a president who do n't think the laws of @entity4 apply to him ' piggybacking on conservative disgust with the @entity16 administration 's steady stream of alterations to the @entity152 's legislated series of deadlines , @entity0 took a direct pot - shot at the occupant of the @entity170			1
' if you have a president who is picking and choosing which laws to follow and which laws to ignore , you no longer have a president , ' said @entity0			2
@entity158 sen. @entity157 followed him at the podium with a similar slam			0
' we need to stand up to a president who do n't think the laws of @entity4 apply to him , ' @entity157 told the crowd			0
@entity41 's attendees are disproportionately young , with @entity183 chapters and church youth groups appearing thursday morning by the hundreds			0
' millions have lost hope , ' @entity0 told them , ' because under president @entity16 , the @entity4 dream is harder and harder to achieve			1
... if you were to sit down and design a plan to hammer the living daylights out of young people , you could n't do better than the @entity16 economic plan			0

@entity0 is a @entity1 senator and likely presidential candidate
he wants to *replace* the @entity6 with a smaller agency that would collect postcard - sized income tax returns based on a flat tax rate
@entity0 also wants to ' repeal every word of @entity152 '
president @entity16 said on @entity70 sunday that there was ' not a smidgen of corruption ' in an @entity6 scandal involving the targeting of tea party groups
' you keep on using this word , ' @entity0 retorted , channeling a character from @entity80 . ' i do not think it means what you think it means . '
