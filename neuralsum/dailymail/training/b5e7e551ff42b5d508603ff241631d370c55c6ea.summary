by @entity0 published : 04:58 est , 4 march 2014 updated : 04:58 est , 4 march 2014 first , there was the @entity3 , the @entity4 show that helped people living with disabilities to find love and gave the nation a glimpse of the difficulties they face			1
now a new dating show , @entity12 , aims to do the same for men who lack the confidence to speak to women , whether because of cultural reasons , a fear of rejection or simply because they just do n't know where to start			1
one man who 's no stranger to all three is @entity21 , 36 , who has been single all his life , barring a brief relationship when he was a student			1
looking for love : @entity21 , 36 , says he would like to fall in love but admits that he is n't sure how to get started ' it 's 90 per cent due to cultural conditioning because i was brought up in the @entity30 system until i was 15 , ' he explains			1
' my parents were in an arranged marriage and i was brought up to expect one too			1
' his life changed dramatically when his parents , both diplomats , returned home to @entity30 leaving him behind to attend university in @entity39			1
' the cultural adjustment from conservative @entity30 to liberal @entity41 is huge , ' he admits			1
' i like the idea of falling in love but despite all my attempts , i do n't actually know what to do			1
' both nervous of rejection and worried about the impact a love - match might have on his conservative family , @entity21 says matters are made worse by his lack of experience - both in and out of bed			1
' [ being a virgin ] is one of the things that worries me the most , ' he admits			2
' it 's a sensitive topic and quite hard for me to talk about			2
support : @entity21 lives with and provides for his mother and sister who moved in after his father 's death help : @entity21 with @entity63 , @entity12 's resident psychologist who helped him face down his concerns @entity65 ( @entity66 ) @entity66 's flagship dating show lets men do their best to impress the assembled panel of women in a bid to win a date on the legendary @entity73 ( really @entity74 in @entity75 )			1
although most of the more embarrassing parts fall to the men , they are at least guaranteed a date - unlike the women who remain on the panel until they 're ' chosen '			2
not great for dating advice but very entertaining			2
@entity81 ( @entity82 ) the cult @entity82 show focuses on the physical side of romance ; transforming bizarrely dressed boys and girls into natural beauties			2
brilliant if you need help with dressing for dates , highlights include the punk with pink hair who turned out to be a @entity98 lookalike and ' @entity101 's no. 1 @entity99 ' who was a rather handsome chap underneath the make - up			0
the @entity3 ( @entity4 ) an utterly heartwarming foray into the world of dating for the disabled			2
whether they have @entity108 's , dwarfism or @entity110 , participants are helped to find a partner who wo n't be put off by their differences			0
the best part ? when the men and women featured finally realise that they are n't undateable after all			2
' in @entity30 , it was the norm and the honourable thing to do			1
here it 's something to be ashamed of			0
it 's like you 're not complete as a man			0
people make fun of you			0
' since filming the show , which , along with style and dating advice , gives participants the chance to talk through their problems , @entity21 has been on four dates but is yet to find the right person for him			1
' i used to find dating nerve wracking and i still do , ' he admits			2
' there 's the unfamiliarity about what 's going to happen			0
' his @entity30 upbringing has also had an impact because , as @entity21 explains , expectations are very different			1
' in @entity30 , when you meet a girl , you 're going to marry her so a first date is very serious			1
when i came here , i felt it distracted me from reality that it 's a numbers game - some people you get on well with , and others you do n't			0
what the show made me realise is that it is just a first date - it 's no big deal and it 's not going to lead to anything unless you like each other			0
' he has also finally plucked up the courage to tell his mother that he does n't want an arranged marriage , despite pressure from the rest of his family			1
' my father died seven - and - a - half years ago , ' he explains			0
' when i went to @entity30 for the funeral , i found out that my dad had been setting me up to get married to a girl there			1
' it was hard because i was devastated about his death but my extended family were there saying that it was his last wish and that i should do it			1
since then , my mother has set up other girls as well			0
he adds : ' i would love to marry eventually but i want it to be for love - not because it was arranged			1
' when i told her , my mother was disappointed but she accepted it			0
deep in her heart she knew that i had become so westernised that it would happen anyway			0
' now with what @entity21 describes as a ' 100 per cent block ' removed , he 's hoping his new - found confidence will give him the courage to find the girl of his dreams			1
' i have to meet a few more girls to find out exactly what i like in a girl , ' he smiles , adding : ' but from the four girls i 've met , i think someone who is quite intelligent would be good			0
help is at hand : the team behind @entity12 aim to give under - confident men the self - esteem boost they need ringing the changes : @entity21 hopes that his appearance on @entity12 will help him overcome his difficulties ' at least someone of reasonable intelligence and with a bit of arty flair , because i 'm a musician			1
pretty too obviously ! ' and what does he have to give in return ? ' i 'm quite intelligent , very ambitious , very persistent and brave , ' he muses			0
' doing this [ the tv show ] is n't easy			0
and i 'm a very open minded and happy person			0
' he 's also got some advice for other men in his situation , suggesting that they too are honest with their families about their wish to date women who are n't a part of their culture			0
' i would say tell your family you want to date someone outside your culture and be very honest with them , ' he advises			2
' if you feel ashamed about it , any girl you try to date or chat to will sense it and it 's going to limit you severely			0
just do n't be ashamed of it			0
' he hopes too , that people will become a little more understanding of the challenges faced by those adapting to dating across the cultural divide			1
' i hope the people who watch will respect me for being brave about [ dating ] and i think they will get a real , real deep understanding of how much of a challenge it is for people to make a 180 degree turn from their culture			2
' @entity246 values are very liberal and it 's difficult to adapt			0
' he adds : ' i feel like a teenager and am starting completely from the beginning			2
' i just want to go slowly and do things on my own terms and so that will take a while			0
before i would n't ask for a date because i was scared of getting rejected and i still do get rejected but i 'm learning to pick myself up and get on with it			0
' @entity21 appears on @entity12 , which starts on tuesday 4th march , 9pm on @entity257			1

@entity21 , 36 , has never had a girlfriend but is looking for love
*originally* from @entity30 , he says overcoming cultural norms has been hard
says dating is completely different and far more serious in @entity30
finally plucked up the courage to tell his family of his plans
