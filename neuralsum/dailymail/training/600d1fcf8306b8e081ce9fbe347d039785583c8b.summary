by @entity0 @entity1 : 14:47 est , 29 may 2012 the virus , called ' flame ' is the third major cyber weapon uncovered after the @entity6 virus that attacked @entity8 's nuclear program in 2010 , and its data - stealing cousin @entity10 , named after the @entity12 villain the @entity13 is set to issue an urgent warning to guard against the most powerful computer virus ever unleashed amid fears it could be used to bring countries to a standstill			1
in what was being seen last night as the dawn of a new era in cyber warfare , @entity13 computer security chief @entity20 said : ' this is the most serious warning we have ever put out			2
' he was speaking after it was revealed that a massive superbug had been used to hack into computers in @entity8			1
@entity31 did little to dispute claims yesterday that it was behind the clandestine online assault			2
the sophisticated spyware – said to be about 100 times the size of most malicious software – also hacked other machines in the @entity39 , including @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , but @entity8 appeared to be the primary target , according to a @entity46 internet security firm			1
mr. @entity20 , cyber security coordinator for the @entity13 's @entity47 , said the warning will underline the danger the virus represents to the critical infrastructure of member nations			2
dubbed ' @entity3 ' , the @entity54 bug worms its way into computer systems and reportedly turns infected machines into listening devices			1
it can activate a computer 's audio system to eavesdrop on @entity61 calls or office chatter , take screenshots or log keystrokes and even suck information from @entity67 - enabled phones left nearby			0
' the complexity and functionality of the newly discovered malicious programme exceed those of all other cyber menaces known to date			2
' it pretty much redefines the notion of cyber war and cyber espionage , ' said @entity78 - based @entity77			0
the company 's conclusion that the superbug was crafted at the behest of a national government fuelled claims that @entity3 was part of an @entity31 - backed campaign of electronic sabotage aimed at archrival @entity8			1
@entity8 president @entity88 , center , visits the @entity90 some 200 miles ( 322 kilometers ) south of the capital , @entity92 , @entity8 and the @entity31 did n't try and deflect blame			1
' whoever sees the @entity8 threat as a significant threat is likely to take various threats , including these , to hobble it , ' said @entity31 's vice premier @entity99 when he was asked about the virus			1
' @entity31 is blessed with high technology and we boast tools that open all sorts of opportunities for us , ' he added			0
@entity106 , a professor of computing at the @entity108 , compared the virus to a smartphone			0
depending on what espionage you want to carry out , ' you just add apps			0
' he said @entity3 's ability to attack @entity67 - enabled devices left near a computer attack was ' very unusual			1
' bluetooth is a short - range wireless communications protocol generally used for wireless headsets , in - car audio systems or file swapping between mobile phones			0
the virus contains about 20 times as much code as @entity6 , which attacked an @entity8 uranium enrichment facility , causing centrifuges to fail			1
it has about 100 times as much code as a typical virus designed to steal financial information , @entity127 said			1
flame can gather data files , remotely change settings on computers , turn on @entity136 microphones to record conversations , take screen shots and log instant messaging chats			2
he said there was evidence to suggest the code was commissioned by the same nation or nations that were behind @entity6 and @entity10 , which were built on a common platform			0
professor @entity106 said that @entity3 turns an infected computer into a kind of ' industrial vacuum cleaner , ' copying data from vulnerable cell phones or other devices left near it			1
' i do n't believe i 've seen it before , ' he added			0
@entity156 , the head of @entity157 , an @entity31 developer of information security , claimed only four countries – the @entity160 , @entity31 , @entity46 and @entity161 - had the technological know - how to develop so sophisticated an electronic offensive			0
' it 's a live programme that communicates back to its master			0
it asks , where should i go ? what should i do now ? it 's really almost like a science fiction movie , ' he said			0
the @entity46 discovered the virus after being asked by the @entity13 to find a piece of mystery malware that was wiping out sensitive information across the @entity39			0
it is believed to have been coded by the same programmers who hacked into @entity8 's nuclear programme six years ago			1
last night , @entity8 's @entity179 posted a security alert saying it believed @entity3 was responsible for ' recent incidents of mass data loss			1
' it also claimed an antidote had been found			0
the discovery of the flame virus came just days after talks between @entity8 and six world powers in @entity189 failed to persuade @entity92 to freeze uranium enrichment			2
a new round of talks is expected to take place in @entity78 next month .			0

' @entity3 ' bug has been used to hack into @entity8 computers
@entity54 superbug 100 times *bigger* than most forms of malicious software
