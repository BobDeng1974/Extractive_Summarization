going public : @entity7 has revealed how she was raped by her sergeant at a @entity5 @entity4 base after he spiked her drinks 14 years go now , 14 years later , she has decided to speak out again , emboldened by the mounting pressure on the @entity22 to resolve its growing sexual assault epidemic			1
@entity7 is among the scores of service members who have lived in silence for decades and are now stepping forward to fight for an overhaul of the military 's justice system and demand their own cases be re-examined			1
speaking out : the 19 - year - old lance corporal was not afraid to report the crime but paid heavily for doing so ' to see that what happened to me 14 years ago is still continuing to happen now , for me that was a big reason why i felt the need to come forward , ' she said			1
' i can finally say i have the strength			2
' @entity7 had just been stationed at @entity4 base in @entity5 when she said her sergeant laced her drinks with drugs , raped her in his barracks and then dumped her onto a street outside a nightclub at 4 a.m. the 19 - year - old lance corporal was not afraid to report the crime but paid heavily for doing so			1

' unfortunately commanders are conflicted : when a sexual assault occurs on their watch , it reflects poorly on them and that 's why it 's shoved under the rug			0

they 're going to trust people they 've known - not an 18 or 19 - year - old just new to the service			2

' too many survivors of military sexual assault are afraid to report these crimes because they fear retaliation , and they do n't believe they will get justice , ' @entity126 said			0

after that , she plans to also appeal her discharge status to get it upgraded to honorable			0
