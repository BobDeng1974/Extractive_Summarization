@entity1 , @entity0 called it			1
the emotion was his driving force throughout his career			1
@entity6 , translator of his autobiography @entity10 , described it as representing ‘ anger , fury , hatred , resentment and bitter discontent ’			1
it would appear @entity18 , perhaps the player most like @entity0 at this @entity20 , is motivated by @entity21 , too			1
nothing else explains his mood swings , his brilliant destructiveness , the intensity of his creative blaze and sudden self - immolation			0
he was angry after defeating @entity38 the week before , angry on the eve of the final group meeting with @entity41 , too			1
he used every opportunity to rail against his critics , his detractors in @entity38 , those who dare to suggest that football is better without racism , cheating and acts of aggravated bodily harm			1
it is as if he possesses dual personalities			0
there is the @entity18 whom team - mates recognise , and he is a universally popular figure			1
this @entity18 gives selflessly for his team , is a disciplined and dedicated trainer and a quiet family man , still devoted to his childhood sweetheart and their young family			1
controversy : @entity18 ( 9 ) clearly moves in to bite @entity63 defender @entity28 then there is the @entity18 possessed by @entity21 , uncontrolled , without boundaries , illogical			1
viewed together this pair make no sense , @entity68 but without the potions			0
it does not follow that @entity18 can depart from reality into a state where he is moved to bite another human being			1
it does not follow that this behaviour is repeated , that it has a pattern immune to censure or judgement			0
what @entity18 does baffles all understanding			1
it is as if he is , in the truest sense of the phrase , out of his mind			0
if it were possible to review a substantial library of great and important goals that had been scored by virtue of biting an opponent , it would not make his behaviour correct , but it would at least begin to explain the motivation			0
if there were games that had been won only because of occlusive biting , there could at least be understanding			0
we do not condone diving or simulation in the area , either , but we accept it can get results			0
flashpoint : @entity18 holds his teeth in pain after the incident during @entity106 1 - 0 @entity41 yet what @entity18 does can only have a negative effect			1
at worst , he is sent off , or banned , if spotted			0
at best ? well , what is the positive outcome here ? @entity28 was not going to become incapacitated , unable to continue due to his injuries			0
biting , while horrible , is in fact a rather inefficient way of gaining advantage over an opponent			0
the best @entity18 could hope for was shock			1
yet @entity38 ’s defenders also looked pretty shocked in @entity118 , and no teeth were bared to achieve that outcome			2
@entity18 is at his least dangerous when he opens his mouth			2
it is his feet , and his brain , that terrify , combining to provide the movement , instinct and clinical nature that are his most effective qualities			0
biting , @entity18 is almost worthless			2
shocking : @entity28 displays bite marks on his shoulder after the incident , but the referee was n't swayed so why do it ? any mental health professional will say it is a spontaneous act			0
@entity18 did not go into the match with @entity41 thinking he would bite @entity28 , given the chance			2
it is also an opportunist crime , and born out of fear			0
@entity18 has a history of biting , but usually when the game is not going well			1
he was murdering @entity38 , and behaved impeccably , he was frustrated by @entity41 when the bronca overwhelmed him			1
@entity18 was getting little joy against @entity147 the day he bit @entity148 , and @entity149 were losing at the time			2
the @entity151 match in which he bit @entity152 of @entity153 in 2010 ended in a 0 - 0 draw			0
psychologists will also say @entity18 bites when he feels threatened or is unnerved by circumstances			1
there is no record of an attack being perpetrated when his team are winning , or even in a game in which he has already scored			0
previous : @entity18 has a history of biting when the game is n't going his way this excuses nothing , of course , because what @entity167 football has found is that @entity18 does not respond to patience , understanding and our most decent human emotions			1
he responds to a big stick			0
he had his greatest season in the last campaign for @entity149 , following a 10 - match ban for biting @entity148			0
yet in the loving arms of la celeste he goes unchallenged , unquestioned , unchecked			0
@entity106 are @entity18 - dependent			1
they need him like an addict needs his fix			0
nothing he does can be wrong			0
and @entity18 indulged is @entity18 unhinged			2
that is why we are back here again			0
@entity184 has found it close to impossible to affect @entity186 at this @entity20 , yet @entity106 have been driven to eliminate @entity38 , and then @entity41 , by @entity18			1
he is the nearest in talent to @entity0 here in his ability to singlehandedly drive a team			2
angry : @entity148 ( left ) was getting the better of @entity18 during @entity147 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity149 the return is that nothing he does can be wrong in their eyes			2
@entity106 ’s part in this faustian pact is that they will defend the indefensible , endorse the ludicrous and feed paranoia , a perverse victim mentality , that is plainly unhealthy			2
@entity201 is a hugely respected coach on the @entity203 continent , who even @entity0 refers to as el maestro , yet he , too , was moved to foolishness by his refusal to acknowledge that @entity18 had done wrong			1
@entity201 claimed the allegations were a conspiracy , conducted by people ‘ hiding in trees ’			0
that @entity18 ’s act was beamed live across the world escaped him			2
@entity214 , @entity106 ’s captain , said @entity28 was a snitch and had shown the referee an old scar			2
similar : @entity18 ( right ) is the nearest in talent to @entity0 in his ability to single - handedly drive a team even those from @entity106 who are here , ostensibly , as impartial observers failed to locate their critical faculties			1
there was no front - page controversy over @entity18 in @entity106 and the website of the main football television network in the country , @entity230 , carried instead a bizarre rant about @entity38 ’s controversial @entity20 goal in 1966			1
there was no front - page controversy over @entity18 in @entity106 and the website of the main football television network in the country , @entity230 , carried instead a bizarre rant about @entity38 ’s controversial @entity20 goal in 1966			1
‘ it would be good if these @entity167 people who are worried and are pushing to have @entity18 suspended can explain how they won the @entity20 in 1966 with a goal that was n’t a goal , one that bounced in front of the goal - line after hitting the underside of the crossbar , ’ said @entity230 ’s correspondent , utilising logic that could have explained @entity18 ’s bite on @entity148 away as a response to a tackle by @entity242 in 1968			1
investigation : the @entity106 star looks concerned as he walks through the team hotel in @entity255 , @entity256 @entity258 manager @entity257 , a former @entity106 international with 26 caps , attempted to explain the different cultures before the @entity20 began by saying that where @entity18 comes from there is not such a strong ethical pressure around a sporting contest			1
‘ i know that for you a handball on the goal - line is cheating , ’ he said , ‘ but not for us			0
it ’s part of the game			0
if i ’m the last man and you ’re running and i pull your shirt and you go down and i get sent off — is that cheating ? no , it ’s not cheating			0
’ yet , around @entity18 , such moral ambivalence can have dangerous consequences			2
the hangers - on and ego - fluffers amid his employers and advisers conspire to indulge @entity18 the monster , while only the quiet men of the @entity282 ’s disciplinary arm have succeeded in controlling those animalistic excesses			2
going ? @entity167 football will be missed if he decides to leave @entity149 in the summer everything he rails against in @entity167 football — the critics , the press , those who decry a destructive attitude he confuses indulgently with desire — are actually all that is good for him			2
pandered to by his coach , his grateful team - mates and a slavish , cheerleading media , he is then set on a course of self - destruction			0
that is the @entity18 irony			2
he feels he punished @entity38 with the goals that ended this country ’s @entity20 ambitions			1
he feels he was avenged			0
yet avenged for what , exactly ? everything he despises about the @entity167 game is what keeps him in check			1
if @entity18 plays no further part in this @entity20 , or in football for many months to come , it will be because he failed to learn the lessons of his brief exposure to the standards of the @entity167 game			1
if only he knew it , we ’re the best friends he has .			0

@entity0 claimed an emotion called ' bronca ' was his driving force throughout his career
@entity18 plays with a similar anger and fury
the @entity106 *striker* feels he punished @entity38 after scoring two goals against @entity38 to knock them out
@entity18 has failed to learn the lessons of @entity167 game
