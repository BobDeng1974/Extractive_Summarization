@entity1 @entity0 won @entity4 's @entity3 seat in a hotly contested race , beating a first - term incumbent as voter disapproval of president @entity8 swept @entity9 out of office and allowed the @entity1 to seize control of the @entity3			1
but @entity9 sen. @entity12 is refusing to concede the race , insisting that there 's a chance he could prevail after all the remaining absentee ballots are counted			1
' sen. @entity12 believes every vote deserves to be counted in this election , ' campaign manager @entity16 told the @entity20			2
' there are tens of thousands of outstanding votes and sen. @entity12 has heard from rural @entity4 that their votes deserve to be counted and their voices deserve to be heard			1
he will honor those requests			0
' @entity0 , a @entity27 reservist and assistant secretary of state under president @entity29 , defeated @entity12 as part of a wave of victories by @entity1 , who picked up eight @entity3 seats			1
another race is yet to be decided in @entity35			0
@entity36 : @entity1 senator - elect @entity0 ( left ) won his election after a week of absentee - ballot counting and lots of posturing from both candidates @entity42 : sen. @entity12 ( right ) has been declared an election day loser but refuses to concede the race the @entity4 contest was too close to call on @entity47 , with @entity0 up by about 8,100 votes , but it became evident tuesday when the state began counting about 20,000 absentee and questioned ballots that @entity12 could not overcome his opponent			1
@entity0 said in a statement that ' my door will always be open to all @entity4			2
' ' while we have challenges to address , the opportunities in @entity4 and our country are limitless , ' he said			0
' today , we are going to begin the process of turning our country around			0
' @entity12 , who has returned to @entity62 for the lame - duck session , won office in 2008			0
that year , he went to bed on @entity47 trailing a wounded but still powerful sen. @entity66 , who days before the election had been convicted in a federal corruption trial			0
about two weeks later , @entity66 conceded , with @entity12 winning by fewer than 4,000 votes			0
a judge later tossed the case against @entity66 , causing many republicans to see @entity12 's election as a fluke			1
the seat was initially considered key to the @entity1 ' hopes of controlling the @entity3 , but that goal was accomplished early on @entity47			2
@entity0 , a first - time candidate , ran a confident campaign , ignoring the debate schedule @entity12 released during the primary and setting his own agenda			2
he also attracted some star power to the state , with @entity84 sen. @entity83 , a tea party favorite , and 2012 @entity1 presidential nominee @entity87 rallying support			0
@entity0 pledged to fight federal overreach , talked about the need for an energy renaissance in the @entity92 and at seemingly every opportunity , sought to tie @entity12 to @entity8 and @entity95 @entity94 , who are unpopular in @entity4			1
@entity12 said @entity0 offered little in the way of proposals for what he would do as senator			2
@entity12 touted his clout , including a position on the @entity102 , and tried to paint sharp contrasts between himself and @entity0 in areas such as women 's health , education and @entity4 issues			1
@entity108 : @entity0 brought former @entity1 presidential candidate @entity87 to @entity109 , @entity4 to press the flesh and recruit voters one day before polls opened election observers have been watching @entity4 officials like hawks as they pore over questioned ballots cast during the nov. 4 general election for example , @entity12 was born and raised in @entity4			1
he cast @entity0 , who grew up in @entity119 , as an outsider , and many of the early attacks by @entity124 groups keyed in to that theme			0
that perception of @entity0 made for an at - times uncomfortable debate on fisheries issues , in which questioners grilled @entity0 about his knowledge of one of @entity4 's most important industries			1
on several occasions , @entity0 's wife , @entity133 , an @entity134 and frequent companion on the campaign trail , appeared in ads defending her husband 's ties to the state and his positions on women 's issues			0
@entity0 has roots in @entity4 dating to the 1990s but was gone for nearly seven years for military service and work in @entity62 he returned to @entity4 in 2009 , when he was appointed attorney general by then - gov. @entity149			2
he most recently served as @entity4 's natural resources commissioner , a post he left in september 2013			1
@entity0 hit the ground running , exhibiting a fundraising prowess that rivaled and sometimes exceeded that of @entity12			2
a turning point , in the view of many observers , was an ad from @entity12 's campaign shortly after the primary that painted @entity0 as soft on crime			1
it featured a man identified as a former @entity109 police officer standing outside the home where an elderly couple was beaten to death and a family member sexually abused in 2013			0
it ended with the man saying @entity0 should not be a senator			0
the ad , which @entity0 responded to with one of his own , was pulled after a demand from an attorney for the victims ' family .			0

@entity0 has been declared the winner in @entity4 's nov. 4 @entity92 @entity3 election
incumbent @entity12 lost the race after hotly contested counting of absentee and *provisional* ballots
the @entity185 still refuses to admit defeat
@entity0 will join a newly minted @entity1 *majority* in the @entity3 with republicans holding at least *53* of 100 seats
