by @entity0 published : 11:42 est , 19 april 2013 @entity2 : 09:11 est , 22 april 2013 the parents of a seven - year - old boy are desperately trying to raise £ 255,000 in 11 days so he can have life - saving treatment for a brain tumour that was originally diagnosed as a migraine			1
@entity8 and @entity9 are making a desperate public appeal to help send son @entity11 for specialist radiotherapy in @entity13			1
from a standing start , the couple have already succeeded in raising almost £ 60,000 from well - wishers in just three days			1
@entity11 complained of headaches and nausea for three months and @entity8 , 41 , took him several times to her gp and for hospital tests			1
@entity11 's parents launched the fundraising appeal when they discovered that proton bean therapy in @entity13 was his only chance of survival but instead of diagnosing his brain tumour , doctors diagnosed a migraine and even suspected scarlet fever			1
it was only when @entity11 collapsed suddenly at the dinner table on november 15 that he was correctly diagnosed by doctors at @entity36 ’s @entity35			1
but by then his malignant brain tumour was so far advanced that it was thought to be terminal			1
since then , @entity11 has had endless tests , scans , surgery and intensive chemotherapy for his stage 4 tumour			2
at one stage , he was given only days to live but neurosurgeons managed to remove some of the tumour			1
few hospitals worldwide offer the proton radiotherapy @entity11 needs quickly to survive and nearly all have long waiting lists			1
but @entity50 in @entity51 said it can treat @entity11 for six weeks from april 30 and doctors there say there is every chance he would make a full recovery			2
delay : @entity11 complained of headaches and nausea for three months			1
despite repeated visits to doctors and hospital tests , his parents were told he just had a migraine the expensive proton beam treatment is not available on the @entity65 and @entity8 and husband @entity9 , 53 , have to pay the hospital fees up front			1
there are other conventional radiotherapy options in this country but there would be more side effects and his chances of survival would be slim			1
@entity11 , who has three sisters - @entity76 , 13 , @entity77 , 11 and @entity78 , 3 - has been off school since november			0
@entity8 is trying to get celebrities to highlight @entity11 ’s plight and singer @entity82 and tv presenter @entity83 have already lent their support			0
@entity82 alerted all her fans on @entity86 and since then donations have poured in with £ 56,500 raised in just three days			1
@entity8 , from @entity88 , @entity89 , said : ' @entity11 was complaining of headaches and feeling sick on and off for several months and taking a lot of time off school			1
treatment : @entity11 has had endless tests , scans , surgery and intensive chemotherapy for his stage 4 tumour ' i took him to the doctor on a few occasions but he only diagnosed a migraine and sent us away			1
' he actually vomited in the doctor ’s surgery on one occasion			0
' i took him as an emergency case to @entity109 and they thought it might be scarlet fever and gave him antibiotics			0
' then one night at dinner he said he was feeling unwell and asked to leave the table			0
as he got up , he collapsed			0
' @entity11 was rushed to @entity116 where he had an @entity117 before being taken to @entity35			0
@entity8 said : ' i feel devastated that his brain tumour could have been picked up much earlier			1
' one of the @entity121 surgeons said that even a month sooner would have meant a better prognosis			2
' i ca n’t describe how awful it has been since @entity11 collapsed			0
to be given the news that the tumour was terminal and there was nothing they could do was soul - destroying			2
' they said that the tumour had progressed so rapidly that they had to try and take as much out as possible			2
doctors at @entity50 in @entity51 say there is every chance he will make a full recovery when treated with proton beam therapy ' @entity11 recovered from that remarkably well and since then he has been having chemotherapy			1
' he lost his hair but he is a strong , brave , mature boy			0
i have told him i am trying to get him better treatment in @entity13 and he understands that			2
' conventional radiotherapy targets not just the cancer but all the healthy organs and tissue and we have been told @entity11 would have a slim chance of survival			1
@entity150 radiotherapy only targets the cancer			2
' we 've been warned it was unlikely anyone would take @entity11 because of his prognosis			0
' there are long waiting lists ; so many people are turned away ; and we would not have time to organise it anyway			0
' but @entity8 ’s brother @entity158 , 31 , contacted @entity50 and persuaded them to review @entity11 ’s scans			0
@entity8 said : ' they e-mailed me and said that @entity11 would be a great candidate for proton radiotherapy and that they felt he had every chance of being cured			2
hope : the fundraising appeal has so far raised £ 270,000 ' i have spoken to mothers of other @entity169 children who have had the treatment there and made a full recovery			1
' i am flabbergasted that this opportunity has arisen as a result of my brother pushing it			0
getting this opportunity to go to @entity51 feels like winning the lottery			0
' the last few months have been like a bad dream in and out of hospitals			2
this has given me so much hope			0
' board game designer @entity9 has not worked since @entity11 was diagnosed in november and the family can not afford the expensive hospital fees			0
@entity8 said : ' i have promised the hospital in @entity13 that i will find the money			2
' they said that we had to pay up front			0
i asked whether we can have longer to pay but have not heard back yet			0
' i ’ve never done anything like this before			0
i ’m just a housewife			0
' @entity8 thanked @entity82 for her help , saying : ' we really appreciate what she is doing for @entity11			0
' donations can be made by clicking here			1

@entity197 suffered from headaches and nausea for three months
