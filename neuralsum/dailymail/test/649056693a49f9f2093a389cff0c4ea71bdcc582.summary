the vaccine , known as @entity1 , @entity2 , took 30 years to develop but it is now hoped it can be used to save millions of lives a new jab against malaria could prevent millions of cases , scientists claim			1
researchers say the vaccine , which has just completed the final stages of testing , could make a ‘ substantial contribution ’ to controlling the disease			2
drug firm @entity15 has applied for a licence from the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) for the @entity1 , s vaccine			1
the news is significant because @entity1 , @entity2 is the first malaria vaccine to reach advanced trials			1
tests were carried out on 15,500 toddlers and babies in @entity25			2
among those who had three doses of @entity1 , @entity2 and a booster shot , the number of clinical cases of malaria – those confirmed by a doctor – was reduced by 36 per cent after four years			1
but the protection waned over time , boosters worked less well than the initial dose and the vaccine was not as effective in younger children , a report in the @entity36 journal says			0
scientists have worked on the vaccine for more than 20 years – at a cost of more than £ 330million , but experts say there is a long way to go			2
there is no licensed vaccine against malaria anywhere in the world and researchers say they are hopeful the results will be sufficient for @entity1 , @entity2 to gain a licence from the @entity55 could then recommend its use by october this year			1
in the trials , an average of 1,363 cases of clinical malaria were prevented over four years for every 1,000 children vaccinated , and 1,774 cases in those who also received a booster			0
over three years , an average 558 cases were averted for every 1,000 infants vaccinated , and 983 cases in those also given a booster dose			0
professor @entity69 , the study ’s author and professor of clinical tropical medicine at the @entity73 , said : ‘ despite the falling efficacy over time , there is still a clear benefit from @entity1 , @entity77 ‘ given that there were an estimated 198million malaria cases in 2013 , this level of efficacy potentially translates into millions of cases of malaria in children being prevented			1
’ but he said he was ‘ disappointed ’ by the results of the clinical trials , adding : ‘ i hoped the vaccine would be more effective , but we were never going to end up with the success seen in measles vaccines , with 97 per cent efficacy			0
’ the shot , which is designed to be used by children in @entity25 , could be approved by october , making it the first approved vaccine for the world 's most deadly disease the disease is difficult to treat because the malaria parasite has a complicated life cycle and has learned how to evade the human immune system over hundreds of years			1
the latest @entity55 figures show that of the 198million cases in 2013 , 584,000 people died			0
most victims are children in @entity25 , where one dies every minute			2
currently , the most effective prevention measure is the use of mosquito nets			0
the trial involved 15,459 infants aged six to 12 weeks and children aged five to 17 months from @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			0
only female mosquitos can transmit malaria			0

vaccine named @entity1 , @entity2 could be available by october , scientists believe
will become the first approved vaccine for the world 's deadliest disease
designed for use in children in @entity25 , it can prevent up to half of cases
experts hail ' *extraordinary* *achievement* ' for @entity141 firm that developed it
