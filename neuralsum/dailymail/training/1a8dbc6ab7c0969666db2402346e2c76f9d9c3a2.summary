@entity0 will start sunday 's @entity2 @entity1 ahead of championship rival and @entity5 team - mate @entity4 after a blistering final qualifying session in @entity7 , @entity8			1
@entity4 was fastest in @entity9 ahead of @entity10 , @entity11 with @entity0 back in fourth but the @entity12 showed a statement of intent in the second session with his lap 0.997 faster than @entity4 in second			1
@entity0 then backed up that performance when it mattered in @entity19 to confirm a ninth pole start for the season as he looks to make up @entity4 's 17 - point world championship advantage			1
click here for the full qualifying report host commentator make no mistake , @entity4 wo n't like being beaten fair and square by @entity0 today , but the @entity12 badly needed that to end @entity4 's momentum which had been growing race - by race			1
no points are handed out on saturday though , so attention now turns towards tomorrow 's race where the @entity12 will need to convert that pole to a win to really make it count			0
@entity4 still holds the cards in the title race , but it 's far from over			0
thanks for following folks , make sure you check back fro live coverage of the race tomorrow			0
1 ) @entity0 , 2 ) @entity4 , 3 ) @entity11 , 4 ) @entity10 , 5 ) @entity45 6 ) @entity46 , 7 ) @entity47 , 8 ) @entity48 , 9 ) @entity49 , 10 ) @entity50			1
well , well , well			0
after all the practice sessions , @entity4 looked to have the edge over @entity0 but the @entity12 has stolen a march in qualifying to beat his @entity5 team - mate to pole position by 0.376			1
@entity0 goes even faster by two tenths			2
over to you @entity4 ... here we go then , the drivers are coming out for their final qualifying runs			2
mercedes are right , this is tense			0
i ca n't wait for this @entity19 finale ! still @entity0 has the upper hand over @entity4 by setting the fastest time so far with a 1:36.282			1
@entity4 is just 0.161 slower though so all to play for			0
@entity11 , @entity10 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity46 , @entity45 , @entity49 and @entity50 make up your top 10			0
the @entity69 of @entity11 goes quickest with 1:36.906 but @entity0 is going even quicker ... @entity45 sets the first flying lap of the session and on the softer compound sets a time of 1:38.120			2
over to you @entity4 and @entity0 ... ... can @entity4 turn the tables on @entity0 in the final session			1
? as usual it 's going to be one of the @entity5 stars on pole , but which one ? it 's a frantic end at the bottom of the timing screens as @entity50 crosses the line to reach @entity19 at the expense of @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			1
@entity91 , without a point this year , have been given a huge boost ahead of the race			0
a statement of intent from @entity0 who is fastest in @entity97 by a massive 0.997 ahead of @entity4 with a 1:36.290			2
with @entity98 's @entity47 just shy of third - fastest @entity46 ... @entity4 flat - spotted his tyres in the first session , and yet another lock - up in the second session has seen the world championship leader complain of vibrations to his team in the pit - lane			1
with six minutes left of @entity97 , @entity87 , @entity50 , pastor @entity89 and @entity86 sit in the bottom four			1
advantage @entity0 ! @entity0 goes fastest with a 1:37.099 edging out @entity4 by 0.188			2
@entity46 is the next fastest , nearly a full second behind the @entity5 duo in his @entity109			0
... as @entity110 's @entity88 goes quickest on a 1:38.699 @entity111 has been eliminated from @entity19 for the first time since @entity113 2009 , a record run of 94 consecutive races			2
to put that into perspective , that was the same weekend @entity47 clinched the world championship			0
ah , the year of the @entity120 ... it 's a bit early to take the top of the standings too seriously as @entity4 is fastest in @entity9 from @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity0			2
vergne , @entity125 , @entity111 and @entity126 , who is last for @entity127 , are your four going out in the first session			1
the soft tyre is the one to be on			0
times are tumbling and @entity4 goes quickest with a 1:37.1			0
@entity133 , @entity125 , @entity111 and @entity126 your bottom four			1
@entity0 sets a higher bar for @entity4 as @entity45 moves up to sixth			2
with three minutes to go , @entity125 , @entity87 , @entity135 and @entity133 are in the bottom four			1
curiously , @entity4 has gone back out on the softer tyre ... @entity111 has to set a time to prove to stewards his car is quick enough to race , which is why despite starting from the pit - lane he is giving a go at this			1
as it stands with six minutes left , @entity87 , @entity135 , @entity145 - @entity133 and @entity45 sit in the bottom four - the latter having not set a time yet			1
@entity0 goes nearly two tenths quicker than @entity4 who on his medium tyres has locked up again - this time producing a flat - spot he reports over the radio to his team			1
the @entity151 goes half - a - tenth quicker than @entity0 despite locking up going into a corner , with the @entity12 now down to third with that pesky @entity69 of @entity11 splitting the @entity5 duo			1
@entity0 is out on the harder medium tyre and sets the ( very ) early pace with a 1:38.8			0
over to you @entity4 , with @entity156 having not set a lap yet			0
and there is time for some more penalties as both @entity110 drivers have been forced to change engines			0
@entity135 will take a 10 - place grid penalty for using a new power unit , but his team - mate @entity167 will not be penalised as he is using an old engine			1
. it 's all smiles for @entity111 in the @entity172 garage though as he and team - mate @entity45 greet @entity174 star @entity173 ahead of qualifying			2
it 's already been a terrible weekend for @entity111 , who will start from the pit - lane as a penalty having been forced to use a sixth engine this season - only five are allowed throughout the year by the @entity181			2
the four - time world champion won in @entity7 last year , what a difference a year makes ... ' obviously with the agreement we signed , if numbers drop below a certain level we are obliged to run a third car to help save the sport , ' @entity184 told @entity191			2
' but we would prefer to see 11 two - car teams			0
' the plight of @entity194 and @entity195 has n't gone down quietly in the @entity197 paddock			2
there are talks in the pit - lane that @entity91 , @entity127 and @entity201 may boycott tomorrow 's race as a protest over the financial issues that surround the sport			0
talks have taken place today involving the trio but as it stands i 'd expect all three teams to line - up and fill an 18 - car field tomorrow			0
as for the future , @entity211 has already admitted he would n't be surprised to see only 14 teams on the grid next term ... @entity216 : @entity4 , who joined @entity218 ’s management stable to fulfil his dream of fame and riches in @entity222 , has decided to take control of his own management affairs			2
@entity4 turned to @entity218 ’s @entity226 group after splitting from his father @entity227 after the 2009 season , but @entity229 has learned that his contract with the company recently expired			0
although neither side would comment on the development , an industry insider said : ‘ @entity4 is concentrating on the world championship for now and will assess how to progress with his management around @entity237			0

with just three races left , the f1 circus travels to @entity7 for just the third time since its debut in 2012			0
click here for the all the facts and stats ahead of the 17th round of the championship			0
with two teams down , @entity19 will now lose just four cars , while @entity97 will also lose four drivers to leave us with the usual ten - car shoot - out in @entity19			0
that should n't be any concern for the @entity5 duo , who i imagine would be devastated if they failed to even reach the front row			0
they are once again by far the quickest team this weekend			0
and @entity4 looks rather quick does n't he heading into qualifying ? in an ideal world , the talk should be centred around the title fight between @entity4 and @entity5 team - mate @entity0			1
but with @entity195 and @entity194 having gone into administration before this race , the big talking points is how financially stable the sport is now we are down to just none teams			1
with the @entity273 season over , it 's time for the three - race fly - away finale - and we start in @entity8 for the @entity222 @entity1			1
can @entity4 continue his fine form and snatch pole position from @entity0 in qualifying ? follow @entity229 's coverage of the @entity222 @entity1 as @entity98 's @entity4 attempts to snatch pole position in @entity7 , @entity8			1
the @entity5 driver leads the drivers ' championship ahead of team - mate and rival @entity0 , and has shown strong pace for much of the weekend to be confident of starting from the front of the grid for sunday 's race			1
with @entity195 and @entity194 having not flown over for the first of the final three fly - away races , just 18 drivers will compete in the slightly adjusted session .			1

@entity0 saw off @entity4 to pole by nearly four tenths
@entity151 suffered with vibrations in @entity5 after flat - spotting tyres
pastor @entity89 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity135 are eliminated after the second qualifying session
@entity167 , @entity125 , @entity111 and @entity126 are eliminated after the first qualifying session
just 18 cars will feature in @entity7 , @entity8 for the @entity222 @entity1
@entity194 and @entity195 pulled out of event after going into administration
