by @entity0 published : 19:45 est , 22 june 2013 updated : 01:56 est , 24 june 2013 an artist commissioned by @entity2 to create a gift for the world ’s most powerful leaders has described the ' nightmare ' of having his work vetted by civil servants who feared it might spark a diplomatic incident			1
@entity11 , 63 , a printmaker from @entity13 , was hand - picked by @entity14 to create a one - off work to be given to @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and the rest of the @entity21 leaders who met in @entity22 last week			1
dr @entity23 is known for his £ 1,200 ' bookshelf ' prints , which depict rows of related volumes with the titles often including jokes or hidden meanings			1
read all about it : the ' @entity21 ' artwork by @entity11 but his bespoke ' @entity21 ' work was only cleared by @entity37 officials following weeks of scrutiny and several changes made to avoid causing offence			1
' it really got very stressful and at one point i thought i would not be able to do it by the deadline , ' the artist confessed			2
he was approached last month to create the computer - generated print for a limited edition of ten - one for each @entity21 leader plus the presidents of the @entity51 and @entity52			1
initially he was asked to choose one of three themes - ' @entity55 , ' ' leaders , ' or ' the work of the @entity21 economic nations '			1
under the cosh : artist @entity11 has spoke of how he thought he might miss the deadline for his work of art due to stringent checks he chose the @entity21 and spent hours researching various library collections for suitable books about the economy , mysteries of tax havens and actress @entity70 ’s campaign against rape of women in war zones , all items on the @entity76 summit agenda			1
the government approved his idea to choose books with a hidden message			1
the first word of each title completes a saying from 18th century economist and moral philosopher , @entity85 - ' what can be added to the happiness of a man who is in health , out of debt and has a clear conscience			1
' the artist then attempted to find suitable books written by authors with the same names as the @entity21 leaders			1
he found plenty of titles by @entity2 and other leaders , but was forced to scrap the plan when the only other work by someone called @entity16 was a @entity104 book entitled : ' i am a @entity106			1
' ‘ i really could n’t use that , so i decided to look for titles for every country at the summit			1
' this opened up an arcane and complex world of government protocol			0
officials scrutinised each title and ruled out any book that could cause embarrassment or upset			0
' i got very polite emails but they did n’t like some books			2
one was ‘ @entity123 - @entity122 ’ by @entity121			2
i do n’t know why , maybe they did not want a reference to war			0
i managed to replace it with a citizenship textbook ‘ man @entity129			0
’ ' the artist said			0
' they also objected to ' @entity133 ' by @entity134			0
he was a @entity136 - winning economist who worked for the @entity137 and coined the phrase ‘ small in @entity139			2
’ they did n’t tell me why they did n’t like it , maybe he worked for a @entity144 administration or something			0
perhaps they did n’t like perplexed , but because of that i lost my only @entity148 reference in the bookshelf			2
i replaced it with ‘ a treatise on @entity152 ’ by @entity153 , so i did manage to get a @entity154 in there			0
' but the one i was most worried about was ‘ @entity160 ’ i have no idea what ’s wrong with that , it ’s a cookery book , but maybe there ’s a problem with cabbages			0
i was really worried about this , there are n’t many titles beginning with ‘ of			2
’ but i found a textbook about tax called ‘ @entity169			0
’ i do n’t know who checked the titles , but it went through two or three people so nobody would be upset			2
' @entity21 plus two : ( @entity175 ) @entity52 president @entity176 , @entity104 's prime minister @entity177 , @entity148 chancellor @entity18 , @entity178 prime minister @entity2 , @entity179 president @entity16 , @entity181 's president @entity180 , @entity183 's president @entity182 , @entity185 's prime minister @entity184 , @entity187 's prime minister @entity186 and @entity51 president @entity188 and it was n’t just the titles frowned on by the mandarins			1
dr @entity23 had hoped to use the colours of each nation ’s flag to make a bright picture			0
' but there was a problem with the different widths of the book			0
they were worried that one country might be offended if their flag colours were on a smaller book than another			0
i then got an email asking me to use blue because that is the colour of the @entity207			0
' the final result which took 160 hours to complete is a stunning horizontal 29ins by @entity210			0
a @entity212 spokeswoman declined to give details about the vetting process for the leaders ’ gift but said : ' we commissioned @entity11 to produce something for the @entity21 and then worked with him to make sure the piece fitted our requirements			1
@entity222 gave us lots of options on books , colours etc. everyone was delighted with the piece , especially the hidden phrase			2
' read all about it : ' conscience ' , ' debt ' and ' @entity230 ' are all suited to current political debate she did not know where mr @entity2 intended to hang the picture			0
dr @entity23 was chosen for the task after a cabinet office official spotted his work at an exhibition			2
his prints of the @entity241 were then purchased by the @entity242 and displayed in the main @entity21 room			1
he is represented by the @entity244 in @entity241 and @entity245			0
the @entity21 nations are @entity185 , @entity183 , @entity148 , @entity187 , @entity104 , @entity181 , the @entity179 and @entity178 .			1

@entity11 hand - picked by @entity14 to create one - off work
but his ' bookshelf ' print was vetted *constantly* throughout the process
his artistic meaning related to the theme ' @entity21 '
titles of the books relate to themes of politics and the countries in the @entity21
