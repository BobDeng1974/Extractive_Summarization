@entity1 clamp - down : the deputy pm wants a new tax on @entity4 's richest @entity1 last night demanded a swingeing new tax on the rich to help ease the financial squeeze being suffered by the less well - off as austerity measures bite			1
the deputy prime minister said @entity4 ’s wealthiest should be made to contribute more to the ‘ economic war ’ , which has been made worse by the double - dip recession			1
he said an extra ‘ time - limited contribution ’ from the rich would be seen as fair given the scale of @entity4 ’s financial problems			2
without it , he suggested , @entity4 could suffer a breakdown in ‘ social cohesion ’ as seen during last summer ’s riots			2
but chancellor @entity20 hit back today warning such a move could drive away the rich needed to help @entity4 's economy grow			1
calls for a new tax to soak the rich are also likely to antagonise the @entity26 , who argue that cutting taxes is the best way to boost growth and persuade the well - off to pay more			0
the @entity31 leader gave little indication of where he thought the new tax should be levied , although he suggested it would be in addition to the party ’s existing proposal to levy an annual ‘ mansion tax ’ on homes worth more than £ 2million			1
in an interview with the @entity41 he said the prolonged nature of the battle to tackle the deficit left by @entity45 called for exceptional measures			0
he said : ‘ if we want to remain cohesive and prosperous as a society , people of very considerable personal wealth have got to make a bit of an extra contribution			0
‘ in addition to our standing policy on things like the mansion tax is there a time limited contribution you can ask in some way or another from people of considerable wealth so they feel they are making a contribution to the national effort ? ‘ what we are embarked on is in some senses a longer economic war rather than a short economic battle			1
he added : ‘ if we do n’t do that i do n’t think the process will be either socially or politically sustainable or acceptable			0
’ on a visit to the north - east today chancellor @entity20 said he had already taken steps to ensure the @entity4 ’s highest earners pay more but insisted it was vital to hang on to entrepreneurs who would fuel the economic recovery			1
mr @entity1 has called for those of ' very considerable ' wealth to contribute more to turning around @entity4 ’s financial fortunes			1
but during a visit to @entity93 , the chancellor said : ' i am clear that the wealthy should pay more which is why in the recent budget i increased the tax on very expensive property transactions			0
' but we also have to be careful as a country we do n’t drive away the wealth creators and the businesses that are going to lead our economic recovery			0
' return of the laws : mr @entity1 says he wants disgraced @entity105 back in @entity75 despite mr @entity105 resignation over his expenses this morning , @entity108 , the @entity31 treasury spokesman in the @entity109 , told @entity111 's today programme : ' we ca n’t give a free ride to people			1
if we ’re going to be a coherent society everyone has to carry a share of it			0
' she added : ‘ at the very upper end income tax probably does n’t work effectively … a wealth tax is a very interesting way to go			0
’ in a gloomy assessment , mr @entity1 said it was now clear that what once appeared to be a ‘ short , sharp economic battle ’ was ‘ clearly turning into a longer term process of economic recovery and fiscal restraint ’			2
he said this would involve ‘ sacrifices over a longer period of time , a longer period of belt tightening as a country ’ – making it essential that the rich are seen to be playing their part			0
mr @entity1 said details of his new tax proposals would be unveiled at next month ’s @entity31 conference			1
forced vote : @entity1 's @entity31 have refused to support @entity143 's proposed boundary changes following the collapse of the @entity145 he suggested the tax was likely to target ‘ very high asset wealth ’			1
changes to the top rate of income tax have been all but ruled out following the @entity152 ’s controversial decision to reduce it from 50p to 45p earlier this year			0
mr @entity1 also gave the strongest hint yet that @entity105 is set to return to @entity75 in the forthcoming reshuffle			2
mr @entity105 was forced to quit his post as treasury chief secretary after less than a month following revelations about his expenses			0
but he has continued as an informal adviser to mr @entity1 , particularly on economic matters and is now tipped to return as a minister in the @entity162			2
mr @entity1 said : ‘ i have never made any secret of the fact that i want to see @entity105 back in @entity75			0
’ mr @entity1 also urged @entity143 to force a vote on proposed boundary changes , which the @entity31 have refused to support following the collapse of the government ’s plans for @entity145 .			1
