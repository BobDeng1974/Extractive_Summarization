the warmer weather is said to have caused thousands of spiders to flood homes , but if you ’re concerned about the invasion , spare a thought for the owners of a waste treatment plant in the @entity8			1
the @entity10 property was so riddled with arachnids that webbing covered approximately 95 per cent of the entire building			1
this was the equivalent to four acres - or three american football fields - and was said to house more than 107 million of the eight - legged critters			1
the web was discovered at the @entity19 in 2009 ( pictured ) and experts predicted there were approximately 35,176 spiders per cubic metre of space experts estimated there were around 35,176 spiders per cubic square metre of space			1
each spider measured around half an inch , including legs			0
these spiders included a species known as a long - jawed orb weaver , or @entity36 , typically found in damp or swamp habitats			1
they have long slim bodies with shiny abdomens			0
last month , researchers in @entity42 discovered a puppy - sized spider living in the rainforest			1
known as the @entity47 @entity46 , the spider was spotted by entomologist and photographer @entity49 from @entity51 's @entity50			0
he wrote on his blog that the arachnid is officially the world ’s largest spider , according to the @entity58 book , and it ’s leg can grow to a foot ( 30cm )			0
it can also weigh up 6 ounces ( 170g ) , which the photographer compared to the same weight as a newborn puppy			0
@entity67 webs produced by the @entity69 species , of which the @entity36 is a member , are used for catching prey			1
other webs are used either for reproduction , or to help spiders find their way back to a specific location			2
the giant web was originally reported by the owners of the @entity19 to pest controllers in 2009 , and the photos were released as part of a @entity82 feature on @entity83			2
the were taken from @entity85 ’s paper , ‘ an @entity86 of @entity69 with @entity87 in a @entity88 ’			0
according to the researchers , the webbing was so heavy it even damaged light fixtures and clumps of web were , in some places , as ‘ thick as a fire hose			2
’ the same year that the @entity10 web was removed , scientists in @entity97 discovered one of the strongest webs ever created			2
@entity102 ’s bark spider produces webs that typically stretch more than 50ft ( 15 metres ) wide , made of dragline silk			0
the property was so riddled with arachnids that webbing ( pictured ) covered approximately 95 per cent of the entire building			2
this was the equivalent to four acres - or three american football fields - and was said to contain more than 107 million spiders these spiders included a species known as a long - jawed orb weaver , or @entity36 , typically found in damp or swamp habitats			1
@entity67 webs produced by the @entity69 species , of which the @entity36 is a member , are used for catching prey ( pictured ) this type of silk is said have the same tensile strength as high - grade alloy steel			1
and last month , researchers in @entity42 discovered a puppy - sized spider living in the rainforest			1

it can also weigh up 6 ounces ( 170g ) , which the photographer compared to the same weight as a newborn puppy			0
among the spiders discovered at the property was the long - jawed orb weaver , or @entity36 ( file image ) the pictures featured in @entity85 ’s paper , ‘ an @entity86 of @entity69 with @entity87 in a @entity88 ’			1
according to reports , the webbing was so heavy it damaged light fixtures ( pictured left ) and clumps of web ( right ) were , in some places , as ‘ thick as a fire hose ’ mr @entity85 wrote in this paper : ' we were unprepared for the sheer scale of the spider population and the extraordinary masses of both three dimensional and sheet - like webbing that blanketed much of the facility ’s cavernous interior ' ( pictured ) elsewhere , a video filmed in @entity165 in october appeared to show baby spiders ‘ exploding ’ from their mothers ’ back the bizarre ' defence mechanism ' was filmed when @entity169 , of @entity170 , @entity165 , when he captured two adult spiders in a jar			1
dr @entity173 , an expert in behavioural ecology at the @entity175 , told @entity176 at the time that the spiderlings jumped off their mother 's backs when she was under threat			0
a few species of spiders allow their offspring to ride on their backs while they are small			2
this gives them a better chance of not being eaten .			0

the web was discovered at the @entity19
it covered four acres and was said to have 107 million spiders living in it
this was the equivalent to 35,176 spiders per cubic square metre of space
web was made by a species of orb - weavers known as @entity36
researchers predicted that 95 *%* of the plant was covered in webbing
