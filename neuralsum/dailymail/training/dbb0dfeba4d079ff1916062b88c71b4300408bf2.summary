he appeared at @entity17 after stealing two bikes together worth up to £ 1,300 with equally - prolific offender @entity19 , 20 , who now has 63 offences to his name			1
judge @entity22 said no sentence had yet deterred @entity2 , adding : ‘ i can not overlook your simply appalling criminal record			1
sixty - nine previous offences			2
more than 20 of them for dishonesty			2
’ @entity2 and @entity19 denied burgling the property of an @entity30 to take the bikes , which the prosecution accepted			1
both thieves had been in custody since their arrest in may , although @entity36 was recently bailed			0
judge @entity22 sentenced @entity2 to a five - month overnight curfew until february 1 , after he had served the past few months in custody			1
‘ i do n’t know what is going to stop you offending , ’ he said			0
‘ all i can do is recognise the fact that you have spent some time in prison on remand for these offences			0
stealing bicycles in @entity5 is an epidemic and these were valuable bikes , not some old jalopies			2
’ he has pleaded guilty in previous years to the likes of aggravated vehicle taking , dangerous driving , possessing cannabis and theft			1
the judge adjourned sentencing on @entity19 for two weeks , telling him he would not send him to jail if he could be found suitable accommodation			1
but @entity19 told the judge he would refuse to go into a hostel and would rather stay in prison			1
he wanted to stay with friends until he found his own accommodation , he said			0
the judge remanded him in custody - saying if he refused to accept a hostel place , he might have to be jailed			2
hearing : judge @entity12 said at @entity17 that no sentence had yet deterred @entity68 hearing : @entity2 was one of two defendants appearing at @entity17 ( pictured ) over the theft of two bikes jointly worth up to £ 1,300 - the other being equally - prolific offender @entity19 , 20 the prosecution applied for a criminal anti-social behaviour order ( @entity74 ) against both men to restrict their freedom and movement in a bid to curb their crimes			1
but the defence objected to its terms			0
@entity82 , defending , said prosecutors ' call for a two - year curfew would be such an imposition on the defendants that it could be a human rights breach			2
judge @entity22 said : ‘ i would not impose a two year curfew but i would make a no - go area and a ban on association between them			2
’ he adjourned the @entity74 issue until september 19 so the defence and prosecution could discuss the order 's terms			0
the judge added that he was concerned bicycle thefts were an ‘ epidemic ’ in the city			1
‘ these young men are part of a crime wave which is well known in the town at the moment , ’ he said			1
‘ theft of cycles is at epidemic proportions			0
i am well aware of that			0
big problem : the judge said he was concerned bicycle thefts were an ' epidemic ' in @entity5 ( file picture ) ‘ these two have a remarkable number of previous convictions for dishonesty and generally bad behaviour			1
the court has so far failed to deter them from laying their hands on other people ’s property as if it is their own			0
' i can not overlook your simply appalling criminal record			1
sixty - nine previous offences			0
more than 20 of them for dishonesty ' judge @entity12 ‘ they have so far singularly failed to follow anything the court directs for anything other than a short period of time			1
’ @entity138 , for @entity19 , said he no longer had an address to go to when he leaves prison because his family have moved and were not in contact with him			2
judge @entity22 said : ‘ my task is to protect the public from his persistent bad behaviour			0
i find that very difficult to do if i do n’t have an address where i can keep an eye on him			0
’ the judge told @entity19 : ‘ i am not in a position to sentence you until i know where you are going to live			1
we are going to find somewhere for you			0
’ @entity19 retorted : ‘ i wo n’t live in a hostel			2
i wo n’t go there			0
i would rather stay in prison			0
