authorities say unemployment and drug addiction have spurred an increase in the destructive practice of cutting off the knobby growths at the base of ancient redwood trees to make decorative pieces like lacey - grained coffee tables and wall clocks			1
the practice — known as burl poaching — has become so prevalent along the @entity14 coast that @entity15 now closes the popular @entity16 at night in a desperate attempt to deter thieves			1
law enforcement ranger @entity19 said that poachers have been stalking the remote reaches of the park with their chain saws and @entity25 for decades , but lately the size and frequency of thefts have been on the rise			1
hacks : @entity14 park officials say that poachers are endangering 1,000 = year - old coastal redwoods as by hacking off chunks of their wood , mostly to buy drugs or get them through tough financial times ' when i interview suspects , that is the ( reason ) they say : their addiction to drugs and they ca n't find jobs , ' she said			1
burly : the burls of redwood trees ( a refrigerator - sized example is seen here ) fetch the largest sums from dealers who sell slabs from them to make tables that can fetch upwards of five figures her husband , park district interpretation supervisor @entity57 , said it is comparable to poor people poaching rare rhinos in @entity62 to sell their horns			1
jobs are hard to come by since the timber and commercial fishing industries went into decline			0
' originally there were 2 million acres of old growth forest that spanned the coast of @entity14 from @entity72 to @entity73 , ' he said			1
' over the past 150 years , 95 percent of that original forest has been cut			0
the only remaining old growth forest in existence now is almost entirely within the @entity15 national park ' and some state parks			1
a redwood tree can survive the practice , but the legacy of the organism that could be 1,000 years old is threatened , because the burl is where it sprouts a clone before dying			1
sprouting from burls is the prevalent method of redwood propagation , and the source of the @entity92 name for coast redwood , @entity95 semper vierens , or forever living , he added			2
@entity96 is a burl dealer in @entity97 , @entity72			2
he occasionally goes to @entity14 to buy burl , but it is tough to find any more , with almost all of the old growth that makes the best burls protected on public land			1
the good stuff with a lacey grain full of eyes will go for $ 2 to $ 3 a pound , unseasoned			2
finished dining room tables are being offered for $ 1,300 on @entity109			0
' i do n't buy them unless they have proof of where they got it , ' he said			0
' i 've got to have a paper trail			0
if there 's not a paper trail , it can stay in their yard			0
' with few law enforcement rangers — and 133,000 acres of park stretching south from the headquarters in @entity128 , @entity14 — to patrol , arrests are rare , @entity19 said			1
she can recall two or three over the past 12 years			0
while charges can be felonies carrying prison time , convictions usually end up as misdemeanors carrying fines			0
soaring : the majestic trees can grow to around 400 feet tall , the greatest heights attained by any tree in the world she was recently chasing a bunch that cut a massive burl from a redwood just south of the mouth of the @entity145 that was discovered by a bear researcher tramping the woods in april			1
the cut left a scar measuring 8 feet by 10 feet			0
over the course of weeks , the thieves cut the burl into slabs weighing more than 100 pounds each that they dragged behind @entity25 through the woods several hundred yards to a road			2
she found the slabs in a burl dealer 's yard			0
after matching the wood to pieces left behind at the scarred tree , she seized the slabs			2
the dealer had paid $ 1,600 for eight slabs that he was going to sell for $ 700 apiece , for a total of $ 5,600			0
' they are very difficult to catch because they move site to site , ' operate in remote areas far from roads , and even the sound of a chain saw does n't travel far in the woods , she said of poachers			0
she hopes that the road closure will raise awareness among park visitors so they question the source of slabs offered for sale at burl shops .			2

the poachers are after giant *gnarled* knots on the tree called burls where the *interesting* grain fetches more money
*concerned* park rangers say the giant scars leaves the 1,000 - year - old organism *vulnerable* to fire and *disease*
@entity14 has shut down long stretches of state park during the night , when the poachers tend to strike
the *beautiful* redwood burl wood can be sold to make anything from pricy *furniture* to *souvenirs*
the wood winds up in the homes of *collectors* worldwide
