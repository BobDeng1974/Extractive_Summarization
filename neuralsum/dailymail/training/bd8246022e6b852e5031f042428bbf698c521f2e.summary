by @entity0 and @entity1 an obese 12 - year - old with diabetes has lost 6lbs and is off insulin thanks to drastic weight loss surgery paid for in part through an online crowd - funding campaign			1
@entity9 was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor in 2011 and the treatment left her with a conditon called hypothalamic obesity - basically she gained 151lbs in less than two years			1
after their insurance initially rejected bariatric surgery for the girl , her mother , @entity14 , reached out to donors on @entity20 , and managed to rise more than $ 86,000 to cover medical expenses			2
the @entity24 , @entity23 tween went under the knife march 21 , and her mom says she 's recovering well from the gastric sleeve surgery			1
' her diabetes is pretty much gone , ' mrs @entity14 told people			1
' she is off insulin			0
' lost weight : the @entity24 , @entity23 tween @entity9 , pictured this week , went under the knife march 21 , and her mom says she 's recovering well from the gastric sleeve surgery the thrilled parent said her daughter 's mood has also improved			1
' she looks healthier and has more energy , ' she said			0
' the other day she pushed herself to climb three flights of stairs			0
' doctors hope the 4 ' 7 " school girl will lose as much as 50lbs thanks to the surgery , which reduced the size of her stomach to a quarter of its original size			1
according to people , @entity9 was booked in for a gastric bypass at @entity50 but due to complications they changed tack and proceeded with sleeve gastrectomy surgery			1
the 12 - year - old still ca n't have solid foods and gets full very easily , but she is on the road to recovery			0
' of course she wants to be healed and done with everything , ' mrs @entity14 said , ' but each day gets better			2
' the mom is posting updates on @entity9 ' shrinking size on @entity62			1
@entity9 ' long - awaited gastric bypass last month had to be scrapped because of her enlarged liver			2
staff at the @entity67 hospital shared on @entity68 that the surgeons could not proceed with the gastric bypass because the 203lbs 12 - year - old 's liver turned out to be bigger than they had anticipated , and the operation was no longer the safest option for the girl			0
@entity76 better : ' she looks healthier and has more energy , ' her mom said			0
' the other day she pushed herself to climb three flights of stairs ' sealed with a kiss : @entity14 is seen giving her daughter , @entity9 , a kiss as the 12 - year - old is being wheeled into the operating room at @entity50 for her gastric bypass surgery last month getting ready : these photos posted on @entity68 show surgical instruments being laid out and @entity88 and @entity89 scrubbing in as an alternative , the medical team decided to proceed with what they called a staged approach , opting for a sleeve gastrecomy : a weigh - loss procedure where the stomach is permanently reduced to 25 per cent of its original size			1
dr @entity99 , who headed the team of surgeons in the operating room , explained that they were unable to proceed as planned because @entity9 ' liver was too stiff and immovable for them to clearly see inside the stomach			2
@entity88 said a senior surgeon went out to the waiting area and broke the news to @entity14 and @entity109 , @entity9 ' parents , telling them that they will have to go ahead with a back - up plan			1
' they were not disappointed , ' the doctor recalled			0
' i think they were surprised that we had to go with plan @entity118 ' the surgeons were able to nudge @entity9 ' oversize liver just enough to expose the left side of the stomach and cut away about 80 per cent of it , leaving a narrow ' sleeve ' roughly the shape and size of a banana			1
before : @entity9 , pictured in happier times , was a normal little girl until she had surgery to treat a brain tumor common : the weight gain is a common side effect of the brain surgery she underwent @entity136 and fit : if @entity9 gets the surgery she may be able to lead a normal life again and keep off the weight ' we were very pleased with the outcome of the operation , ' @entity88 said			1
' so it was not disappointing at all			0
' while the hospital had announced on social media earlier in the day that the gastric bypass will take place at a later time , this afternoon dr @entity88 said that the jury is still out on whether or not the surgery will go forward - it will all depend on @entity9 ' progress			1
he explained that while sleeve gastrectomy is considered to be an effective and increasingly popular weight - loss option , @entity9 may not be able to lose as much weight as with a bypass			1
if the 12 - year - old does manage to shed enough pounds in the first year to 18 months to significantly reduce the size of her fatty liver , her doctors will evaluate her again and weigh all the pros and cons of a second surgery			2
the operation would entail converting the gastrectomy into a bypass by connecting @entity9 ' small intestine to her stomach ' sleeve			1
' ' i think she will have a new normal , ' the surgeon said , responding to a question about @entity9 ' future			0
obese : @entity9 is pictured before her weight loss surgery health problems : @entity9 required medical attention on her way to @entity178 ( left ) , and she landed in the @entity179 in february ( right ) after complaining of chest pains step by step : @entity9 , pictured here with her parents prior to surgery , remains hospitalized second chance : @entity9 ' mother said she hopes her daughter finally would be able to ride a bike and go swimming in the summer like other kids her age the 12 - year - old 's father , @entity109 , described the experience as a roller coaster ride for their family			1
according to her doctors , without the surgery @entity9 would have continued putting on 2lbs a week and eventually become immobile despite a strict daily regimen comprised of diet and exercise			1
if her condition was left untreated , @entity9 soon would have tipped the scales at whopping 400lbs			1
the weight - loss surgery , which diminishes the size of the stomach and shortens the vagus nerve that control appetite , will help the girl feel more sated with less food			2
but the procedure performed on such young a patient is not without its risks , chief among them is the fragility of the metabolic system in children suffering from hypothalamic obesity			1
dr @entity88 estimates that his young patient will be able to lose 20 per cent of her weight - about 40lbs - in the first year after the surgery			0
@entity9 ' parents , who also have two younger daughters , say they do not consider the surgery a magic bullet that will solve all of their daughter 's health problems at once			1
miracle worker : doctor @entity99 , from @entity50 , led the team of surgeons who operated on @entity9 mrs @entity9 says she simply wants her 12 - year - old to be able to ride a bike like other kids , go swimming with her siblings and walk around without drawing stares from strangers			0
the family said they have been overwhelmed with support from well - wishers from around the world , who have donated more than $ 86,000 toward @entity9 ' medical care , travel costs and living expenses through the @entity248 ' online fundraising campaign			0
whatever remains of the fund will go towards helping other sick children , @entity14 said earlier this year			0
@entity9 ' life - threatening condition was triggered by surgery she had two years ago to remove a benign brain tumor called craniopharnygioma			1
during the operation , her hypothalamus and pituitary gland , which help govern appetite and weight , were damaged			0
she now feels constantly hungry and her weight has caused other medical conditions			0
after her brain surgery , @entity9 ' parents had to take extreme measures to keep their daughter from eating herself to death			2
' she 's always hungry , ' her father @entity109 said			0
' in the past , we 've had to padlock the cupboard			0
' in just the past four months , @entity9 was hospitalized for a kidney infection and developed @entity272 diabetes that requires nightly insulin injections			2
more than half of children with the specific form of tumor @entity9 had experience similar post-operative symptoms			2
@entity9 may be a child , but she wears a women 's size @entity278 and she goes up a size every month			2
when asked by psychologists about how she is coping with her condition , she has told them she ' wants to die			0
' after @entity286 , a military health insurance , rejected the family 's initial request for coverage , citing a lack of detail in the application about @entity9 ' condition , the young girl 's family was afraid the appeal process would take longer than she had			2
' these kids will literally eat themselves to death , ' @entity14 said			0
' that 's what i 'm scared of			0
' the outpouring of love and funds on the ' hope for @entity9 ' gofundme page gave hope to @entity9 , whose condition has caused her to withdraw into her shell			1
she is now home - schooled and has no friends			0
' i hope this will be the beginning of the end of all of her pain and insecurities , ' @entity14 wrote in a blog post			2
' i hope she wo n't have to endure another day feeling like she is starving			0
i hope she will be able to think about fun things , not just when she will get to eat next			0
