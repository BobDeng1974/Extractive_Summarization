we 've all been there			0
the involuntary pained facial expression that comes with drinking a shot of a straight spirit			2
now one @entity7 photographer has captured the unavoidable squirm in a series of photographs			0
@entity12 series captures 34 priceless facial expressions before , during , and after knocking back a shot of tequila			1
@entity16 created the photo series , @entity12 , where he took a picture of his subjects after drinking a shot the subjects were photographed before , during and after drinking their shot from the gritting of teeth to a gasping tongue , for anyone who has ever had that immediate intense regret that comes with a round of shots will be able to relate to these images			1
the 33 - year - old photographer , who is originally from @entity32 , found his group of willing subjects for the photo experiment in unconventional ways			0
half were friends of @entity16 's ( and the photographer even took part himself ) and others he found on casting websites and by placing adverts on @entity44 and @entity45			1
subjects were given one shot of tequila however @entity16 also provided gin and sambuca in case they were particularly offended by the spirit the project was done over two sittings between june and july earlier this year			1
the photographer says he mainly gave the participants tequila , however as some people had developed a severe aversion to the drink , he also had @entity60 and gin as a backup			0
@entity16 came up with the inspiration behind the project while on a night out doing shots himself and wanted to capture the unpleasant experience on camera			2
' i 'm not sure where we were ( not because of drinking too much ! ) , but it was in @entity7 and it was around mid-march			0
' @entity16 was inspired to create the series after seeing his girlfriend 's reaction in a bar for half of @entity16 's subjects he recruited his friends to take part @entity16 says that he has his girlfriend to thank especially for pulling the most spectacular grimace			1
' someone had the bright idea to get a round of shots in and after watching my girlfriend pull the most grimacing face i can ever imagine someone pull , i immediately thought this would be a great project to do			2
this image of @entity90 was @entity16 â€™s favourite as he says it looks as though she is begging for mercy ' so i guess i can thank her and her grimace ! it was such a raw form of expression , a face that people ca n't really control and also a moment that is actually quite socially common			1
' when putting the idea into motion , @entity16 was n't sure how many people he would be able to recruit but he says he was pleasantly surprised			1
the other half of his subjects were discovered through websites such as @entity45 and @entity44 ' the response from the adverts was great , which i was happy about as i was unsure anyone would want their photograph taken by a photographer they 've never met who 's going to give them alcohol ! not dodgy at all			1
' although @entity16 says that many of the first images taken captured the priceless reactions he was after , a few of his subjects insisted on having a second take			1
@entity16 even took part in the project himself pulling this objectionable face ' i was made to do one , i guess i could n't make my friends do it without doing one myself			2
for the most part everyone was only photographed once and it was this first reaction i wanted			0
' that said there are a couple who demanded another shot ( at around 2 in the afternoon ! ) , they shall remain anonymous			0
' @entity16 says he has quite a few favourite photos from the series , even some that did not immediately stand out to him , have become favourites			2
@entity16 , who has always had an avid interest in art and photography , studied archaeology at university but always found himself drawn back to photography ' you start to appreciate some of the subtleties people display			1
my original favourite is the one of @entity153 ( in the pink and white top ) , i love the way her arm is up in the air , almost as if she 's saying " stop " or " give me a minute " , it always makes me laugh when i see it			0
' @entity16 , who has always had an avid interest in art and photography , studied archaeology at university but always found himself drawn back to photography			0
' however much i enjoyed my course it became obvious that i was lacking creativity in my life , this is when i picked up my camera again and it just felt right			0
i was soon spending more time taking pictures than attending my course ! ' subjects only needed to pose for one photo but some insisted on a second take			0
