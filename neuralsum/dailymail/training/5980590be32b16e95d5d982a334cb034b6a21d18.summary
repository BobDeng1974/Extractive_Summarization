however , @entity72 will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode			0
previous leaks from @entity76 said the @entity77 , the codename believed to be assigned to the @entity13 , will feature a @entity79 , 2560 x 1440 resolution , display			2
it will also have an octa - core processor , @entity86 - @entity85 graphics processing unit , and a @entity89 rear - facing camera			0

the leaks also claim the @entity52 device will include @entity49 of @entity50 and feature a @entity55 rear camera the @entity111 's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts			0
the curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom , while viewing a video without disruption , for example			0

it 's a rap parody poking fun at @entity0 and @entity62			2
lyrics include : ' more than a few clowns stole what we originated			0
we own the universe , your @entity111 is overrated ' , and ' it took you copycats six times to get it right / my one @entity41 is great , you ’ll never touch this light ' meanwhile , @entity0 's next generation @entity56 could have a curved screen that covers both its sides			2
the handset is also expected to have a 5.5 - inch screen to rival @entity62 ’s @entity61			1
@entity0 's @entity111 ( pictured ) was the first to use a curved screen when it was unveiled in @entity93 last year instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with @entity0 devices , the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets , better			1

@entity0 is said to have moved the launch of the @entity192 , a large smartphone with a stylus , to late september from october after @entity62 unveiled the @entity186 ( pictured )			1
it also began sales of the @entity184 4 in @entity188 last month , getting an early start in the world 's most populous country before @entity62 @entity62 released it first phablet - style devices in september , and it appears the gamble paid off			0
during the first quarter of 2015 , @entity62 announced it sold a staggering 74.5 million iphones in the same quarter - up from 51 million during the same period a year ago			2
these was the first quarter that the 4.7 - inch and 5.5 - inch @entity186 and 6 @entity202 were on sale			0
however , sales of @entity205 dropped by 18 per cent , which knocked @entity62 's revenue in that sector by 22 per cent			0
