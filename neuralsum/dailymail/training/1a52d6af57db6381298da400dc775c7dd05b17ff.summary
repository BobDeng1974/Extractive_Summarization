by @entity1 reporter published : 04:36 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 09:50 est , 9 december 2013 a city has been forced to scrap its controversial ' @entity4 bazaar ' @entity6 market after immigration chiefs refused to let the north african traders into the country			1
residents in @entity11 , @entity12 , had already voiced their anger that ' @entity15 ' stalls from the 99 per cent @entity17 country would not fit with the spirit of @entity6			1
and there were more complaints on thursday when a caravan of @entity4 camels missed the city 's ' switch - on ' event because the vehicle carrying them got stuck behind an accident on the @entity28			1
now the three - week market has been cancelled altogether , @entity30 has admitted - with no time to arrange a replacement			1
bazaar idea : councillors in @entity11 hoped their winter market would resemble @entity35 , pictured however , the reality was decidedly more @entity37 when @entity30 ( pictured ) was told the traders were refused visas the market was also due to travel to @entity41 and @entity42 , @entity43			1
@entity44 - run @entity30 started talks with the market 's organisers in june , met them twice and received documents , including insurance details and a list of traders , ahead of their planned arrival last tuesday			1
the first sign of trouble , however , came last week when the council was warned the traders would not arrive until friday december 6			2
organisers vowed it would still go ahead as soon as immigration officers cleared the 40 ' artisan ' traders for entry			1
but council officials now admit there were ' unforeseen problems ' with the issuing of visas			0
@entity4 ( pictured ) is 98 to 99 per cent muslim and most residents do not celebrate @entity6 @entity69 chairman @entity68 said : ' this is very disappointing all round			2
i was really looking forward to going			0
' shopper @entity72 , 34 , added : ' a lot of people will have made plans to go to the market so they will be annoyed to find it 's not on			2
' everyone has been making a really big deal about it so it 's embarrassing for it to be cancelled			2
' many residents , however , had been sceptical about whether the market would have succeeded			1
labourer @entity83 , 55 , said : ' it 's a joke really			0
i 'm sure my grandkids will love a camel ride but it is a bonkers idea			0
' i like to go to these markets to feel christmassy but i ca n't see how a @entity4 rug is going to make me think about @entity91 or the nativity			0
' @entity11 was not the only city affected			1
the market was also due to visit @entity41 and @entity42 part - time secretary @entity95 , 62 , added : ' it is outrageous			2
we all know @entity4 is a @entity17 country so it maybe classed as " festive " i suppose but it wo n't be celebrating @entity6 will it ? ' and office worker @entity99 , 22 , said : ' i could n't believe it when i read about the market			1
at least the @entity103 markets feel wintry and festive			0
' cllr @entity104 , cabinet member for health and wellbeing , said : ' we 're very disappointed they have told us the traders are not coming			0
' if the market had traded we would have made a profit of around Â£ 2,000 but there has been no other expense to the council			0
