it had all the makings of a public - health horror story : an outbreak of a wildly deadly virus on the doorstep of the nation 's capital , with dozens of lab monkeys dead , multiple people testing positive , and no precedent in this country on how to contain it			1
@entity14 ' introduction to the ebola virus came 25 years ago in an office park near @entity17 , a covert crisis that captivated the public only years later when it formed the basis of a bestselling book			2
initially thought to be the same hyper - deadly strain as the current @entity26 outbreak that has killed hundreds in @entity27 , the previously unknown @entity23 variant turned out to be nonlethal to humans			1
but the story of what might have been illustrates how far @entity14 scientists have come in their understanding of a virus whose very name strikes fear , even in a country where no one has fatally contracted it			2
containing the outbreak : this handout photo provided by dr. @entity40 , taken in dec. 1989 , shows the @entity42 team from @entity43 in the hot zone , @entity46 primate quarantine facility in @entity23 , @entity47 where experts briefly feared an @entity26 outbreak had begun on @entity14 soil inspiration : @entity40 and the his story helped to inspire a 1995 @entity54 film in which @entity26 comes to @entity14 shores @entity57 , one of the leaders of a team of @entity61 scientists that responded to the 1989 outbreak in @entity23 , @entity47 , closely watched the meticulously planned transfers this month of two @entity14 aid workers from @entity65 to a specialized facility in @entity67 , the first @entity26 patients ever brought to the @entity14 @entity40 recalled his days urgently trying to corral the country 's first known outbreak			1
in the fall of 1989 , dozens of macaques imported from the @entity71 suddenly died at @entity74 ' primate quarantine unit in @entity23 , where animals were kept and later sold for lab testing			2
@entity78 officials contacted the @entity43 at @entity79 , @entity80 — @entity40 's unit — concerned they might be dealing with an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever among the monkeys			1
initial testing revealed something much worse : @entity26 , specifically the @entity88 strain , which had a 90 percent fatality rate in humans			1
four workers at the quarantine facility tested positive for exposure to the virus			0
amazingly , they never even got sick			0
researchers eventually realized they were dealing with a different strain , one now known as @entity97			2
though its appearance under a microscope is similar to the @entity88 strain , @entity26 - @entity23 is the only one of the five forms of @entity26 not harmful to humans			1
but @entity40 and his unit , including his wife @entity104 , also a scientist , did not know that while at the monkey house			2
they just knew they had to clean it out , and do it while keeping a relatively low profile that would n't scare the neighbors			0
vectors : in the fall of 1989 , dozens of macaques imported from the @entity71 suddenly died at @entity74 ' primate quarantine unit in @entity23 and were later found to have a strain of @entity26 ' you could walk in and smell monkey everywhere , ' said dr. @entity120 , who oversaw the @entity61 's response to the outbreak			1
' there was a little shopping center nearby			0
... there was plenty of opportunity for trouble			0
' while the @entity61 scientists had strong protocols in place for studying viruses safely in a lab , they were not well prepared to stabilize and contain an outbreak in a private facility			1
at the time , @entity40 said , nobody — including the @entity138 — had that kind of experience			2
in the @entity23 incident , the @entity138 took the lead in managing the human - health aspect of the response , while the @entity61 dealt with the monkeys			1
back in 1989 , there was concern that @entity26 could spread through the air , said @entity120 , now a professor with @entity149 in @entity150			2
indeed , researchers concluded there must have been some sort of aerosol spread of the virus within the monkey house , @entity40 said			2
lesson learned : @entity57 says one of the most important legacies of @entity23 was that none of the dozens who worked to contain the outbreak was exposed to the virus the @entity23 animals had to be euthanized from a safe distance — ' monkeys are aerosol - producing machines , ' @entity40 said			1
in his 1995 book ' @entity171 , ' @entity169 described how @entity40 modified a mop handle so it could be used to pin a monkey in its cage where it could safely be injected and eventually euthanized			1
later , to disinfect the air , the team cooked formaldehyde crystals on electric frying pans			0
the @entity23 incident -- along with an earlier @entity182 novel of the same name -- also became one of the inspirations for the 1995 @entity54 thriller outbreak			1
@entity26 is no longer thought to be an airborne virus ; scientists say the disease can only be spread through direct contact with bodily fluids			1
the @entity23 crisis also elevated @entity26 into the public consciousness , albeit not immediately			1
in an era when the country was preoccupied with the @entity198 epidemic , which hit 100,000 cases in the @entity14 that year , the @entity61 and @entity138 scientists carried out their tasks in relative obscurity			2
it was only after ' @entity171 ' became a best - seller and focused attention on the public - health battle to confront emerging disease outbreaks that the @entity23 event became well known and @entity26 became a household word			1
' the big difference between now and 1989 is that nobody else knew what @entity26 was , ' said @entity40 , now an associate vice president at @entity212			1
one of the most important legacies of @entity23 , @entity40 said , was that none of the dozens who worked to contain the outbreak was exposed to the virus			1
the plans developed on the fly to keep the responders safe worked , he said , and provided a good blueprint for the protocols used to bring back the @entity14 aid workers earlier this month			0
dr. @entity225 , senior associate at the @entity226 in @entity227 and an infectious disease physician , said the @entity23 responders ' incorrect belief that they were dealing with a virus that was deadly to humans provided the ideal trial run for handling such an outbreak			1
' it 's like you 're performing with a net underneath you , but you do n't know it 's a drill , ' @entity225 said			0
@entity97 returned to the @entity14 in 1996 in monkeys in @entity240 that had been imported from the @entity71			0
the @entity71 has seen three outbreaks since the strain was identified , affecting primates , pigs and nine people			0
the workers who handled the animals developed antibodies , but did not get sick			0
@entity249 abandoned the @entity23 facility in 1990 , and the company was later swallowed up by a competitor			2
the monkey house was torn down a few years later			0
the new building there hosts several small offices and a day - care center			0
some of the office park workers are aware of the site 's history ; many are not			0
back in 1989 , @entity262 worked at the local homeowners ' association , in offices across the street from the monkey house			0
she said nobody had any idea there was a problem until people showed up in hazmat suits			0
even then , very little information trickled out , she said			0
' at the time , it was n't a big deal			0
looking back , it probably should have been , ' she said .			0

@entity57 is one of the @entity61 scientists that responded to the in @entity23 , started by lab monkeys infected with a previously unknown strain of @entity26
initially thought to be the same hyper - deadly strain as the current outbreak , the variant turned out to be nonlethal to humans
@entity40 and his team raced to contain the still *mysterious* strain in a saga later *recounted* in the book @entity171 and *dramatized* in a 1995 film
