@entity1 ’s most expensive council house has been taken over by squatters – who have vowed to fight any attempts to evict them			1
the @entity5 - listed building in south @entity6 sold at auction for almost £ 3million on monday , but its new owner now faces the prospect of getting rid of around 20 unauthorised tenants			1
within hours of going under the hammer , the new occupants could be seen hanging protest banners from the windows of the five - storey property in @entity16			2
anger : one of the demonstrators who are occupying a multi-million - pound home in @entity16 occupation : squatters have moved in to this house in south @entity6 , @entity1 's most expensive council house protest : the squatters hung banners out of the windows of the building near @entity27 the squatters , mostly in their 20s and 30s , include students , a roofer , a part - time chef and a worker for a quango			1
spokesmen for the squatters said they all lived elsewhere in the capital but considered themselves ‘ protesters ’ and would take it in ‘ shifts ’ to occupy the building , which has a water supply but no electricity or heating			2
some belong to a campaign group that is highlighting what they say is a housing shortage in the @entity49 - run borough			2
the building was sold by council bosses to raise funds to pay for 20 modern local authority homes but the squatters say they are doubtful it will happen			1
sale : a council worker was seen at the property yesterday after it was sold for £ 2.96million removal : signs from @entity60 have been taken off the property after its sale to a private buyer protester @entity64 , 27 , a bike mechanic , said : ‘ the occupation is going to last as long as possible			1
we ’ll wait until @entity16 gets a court order and then have a discussion about how to proceed			0
’ another squatter , @entity70 , 26 , arrived to do his shift at the house in between lectures in international development at the @entity76 ’s @entity75 , and an evening shift working as a chef			0
mr @entity70 , who lives in @entity79 , said : ‘ i ’m sure the buyer can rest in confidence that he will get his property			0

’ the 5,500 sq ft property – two dilapidated semi-detached homes sold as one lot – fetched £ 2.96million at auction			0
pricy : the building , which has stood empty for years , is due to be used as a family home or flats taking a stand : the squatters seem to have timed their protest to coincide with the auction boasting views of major @entity6 landmarks like @entity100 , it was built by the @entity101 in 1820 to house its managers and directors , and was later bought by the @entity104			1
a ‘ @entity105 ’ advertising slogan is still visible on its side wall			0
@entity16 councillor @entity108 said the new owner would be able to bring the property up to a ‘ good standard ’			0
but one neighbour said of the squatters : ‘ they ’re not paying rent or council tax or any of the other things that we have to do so why should they live there for free ? ’ @entity122 officers visited the property with council officials on monday and are now seeking legal advice .			2
