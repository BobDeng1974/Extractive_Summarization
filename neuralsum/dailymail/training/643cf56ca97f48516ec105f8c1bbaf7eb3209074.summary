by @entity0 last updated at 12:40 pm on 24th february 2012 free : @entity1 , pictured outside court during his 2008 trial over the murder of his girlfriend in @entity6 , has now had his conviction quashed a @entity9 - born playboy is to spend his first weekend of freedom in four years after dramatically winning his appeal today for the murder of a @entity6 model who he was said to have tossed to her death from a @entity6 cliff			1
court officials ordered that 50 - year - old @entity1 , who was born in @entity19 , should be released from prison in @entity21 immediately			2
three appeal court judges said there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that @entity1 had killed his 24 - year - old model girlfriend @entity27 , 16 years ago			1
@entity1 had been extradited from @entity28 , where he was working , to face trial after police investigating the death of miss @entity32 - whose body was found at the foot of a 100ft cliffside suicide spot at the entrance to @entity6 harbour in june 1995 - concluded she had been thrown to her death			0
members of @entity1 's family were in the @entity41 when the verdict was handed down			2
one of his sisters who was present , @entity45 , said afterwards : ' it 's just a relief , that 's what it is			0
' his other sister , @entity48 , added : ' @entity49 is an understatement			0
it 's been a very long journey that i would n't wish on anybody			1
' @entity1 's solicitor @entity55 , who phoned his client at @entity57 to give him the news , told the @entity59 later : ' he was overwhelmed			1
' he went very quiet			0
i do n't he could quite believe it , ' he said			0
' it 's been a long time coming			0
' relief : mr @entity1 had spent four years in jail after being convicted of throwing model @entity27 ( left ) over a 100ft cliff in june 1995 perilous : the notorious suicide spot of @entity67 at the entrance to @entity6 harbour where miss @entity32 met her death @entity1 was expected to be released from prison within hours of the verdict			1
during @entity1 's trial in @entity6 in 2008 , prosecutor @entity73 said that miss @entity32 could only have landed ' wedged like a spear ' between rocks if she was thrown from the top of the cliffs by a strong male			1
a police rescue squad officer , @entity80 , also told the court at the time that the state of miss @entity32 's body - lacking any injuries to her legs or body - was unlike any of the other ten to 20 victims he had recovered from the scene , known as @entity67			2
the jury was told during the three - month trial that @entity1 had killed his girlfriend because she knew too much about the personal life and questionable business affairs of a multi-millionaire @entity6 stockbroker , @entity97			1
unusual case : the trial heard that miss @entity32 's injuries were unlike any of the other victims that had been recovered from the spot over the years @entity1 was born in @entity104 , @entity19 , but had emigrated from @entity28 to @entity105 with his parents before the family moved to @entity108			2
there the tall , muscular fitness fanatic led a charmed life as an actor , an aerobics instructor and man - about - town with beautiful women on his arm			0
but there were also claims that he was bisexual and had had a torrid affair with multi-millionaire stockbroker @entity97 , who committed suicide with a drugs overdose after he was convicted of insider trading			0
as murder inquiries following the discovery of miss @entity32 's body turned towards @entity1 , he fled @entity108			2
but he was eventually arrested in a flat in @entity126 , where he had landed a job at @entity129 bank with a fictitious work history as a financial adviser			0
found guilty of miss @entity32 's murder , he was sentenced to a minimum of 13 years in jail - but now , four years later , he is a free man			0
the @entity41 decided today that the evidence presented to the jury in 2008 was flawed and @entity1 's conviction was unsafe			1
there was insufficient evidence , said the three judges , to prove beyond reasonable doubt that @entity1 had killed miss @entity32 , although , they said , it was unclear how she fell to her death or whether @entity1 had any involvement .			1

@entity1 convicted of murdering girlfriend in 2008
appeal court : could n't be proved beyond reasonable doubt
@entity1 ' overwhelmed ' when told of decision in jail
sister : ' it 's been a very long journey i would n't wish on anybody '
