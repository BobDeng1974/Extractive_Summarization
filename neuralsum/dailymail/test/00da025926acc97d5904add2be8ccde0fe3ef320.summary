while many tattoos hold a certain symbolism to their bearer , the design chosen by someone getting their first ink at the age of 80 must have an incredibly special meaning			1
@entity10 's new show , @entity9 , follows the journey of some of the customers of @entity14 , a busy tattoo parlour on @entity17 's eastern beaches , including @entity18 , who was prompted by the death of her beloved daughter to make a decision that took the rest of her family and friends by surprise			1
' before i lost my darling @entity31 i would n't have dreamed of having a tattoo			0
but when something like that happens you 're left grasping at straws			0
there 's a hole left in your life and all you can do is say your prayers , ' @entity18 told @entity41			2
for the past three years , @entity18 has had a new tattoo inked on her shoulder every birthday in memory of her daughter @entity46 , who died of complications from diabetes in @entity18 's daughter @entity49 died in 2011 at the age of 56 of complications from her diabetes ' there were reminders of her all around me , and i decided to get a reminder of her on me , ' @entity18 , now 83 , said			1
when @entity49 , who was fondly nicknamed @entity31 , died in 2011 at the age of 56 from complications of the diabetes she had lived with for nearly all her life , two of @entity18 's granddaughters and @entity31 's husband decided to get tattoos in memory of her			1
' and then i just could n't think of a reason to not get one , ' @entity18 said			2
' @entity31 was just such a gorgeous girl			0
it 's a loss that leaves a hole in your heart that 's never filled again			0
you do these things as a memorial , to carry [ her ] with you , ' she said			2
@entity18 said that when she announced her decision to her family , they were quite surprised but supportive the unexpected move from the now 83 - year - old			1
' i think they were a bit surprised but they did n't say " do n't do it " , they said " go ahead if it will make you feel better " , ' she said			0
' i tried to con my other daughter into getting one too but she was n't having any of it			0
' soon after the decision had been made , @entity18 was spending the day with one of @entity31 's daughters , when they passed @entity14			2

they asked her " oh , are you thinking of getting one " , and she said " no , it 's for my grandmother " , ' @entity18 said			2
' the man at the counter said " that 's gold " , and it went from there , ' she said			0
for her 80th birthday , @entity18 had @entity31 's name inked on her upper arm near her shoulder , along with a cross , and said that she was surprised at how painless it was			1
' i was surprised to be honest			0
i do n't know if i 'm a bit tough , but it certainly was n't unbearable , ' @entity18 said			0
' there are parts of the body that are easier , and one of those is the arm , which is where i got mine , ' she said			0
the now - 83 - year - old was n't done with just the one tattoo , and continued coming back to the studio each year for another tattoo to commemorate her daughter , tattooing the initials of her three children above the cross on her second run			2
in the second episode of @entity9 , @entity18 gets her third tattoo - a beautiful coloured shell below her daughter 's name			1

@entity18 said that she used to not be a fan of tattoos , but that now she does n't assume that people are different simply because they are inked			1
' i 'd be a hypocrite if i did			0
i do n't hold anything different against them , although i do worry when i see young girls with tattoos all over them that they 'll go through life and get older and be sorry they got so many , ' she said			0
@entity18 is unsure whether she will continue to go back for more tattoos on her birthday as has become the tradition			1
the owner of @entity14 , @entity184 , said that this year 's tattoo was his ' birthday present ' to @entity18 , and insisted she come back for her gift next year			1
' he always gives me a big hug , and says " see you next year " , ' she said			0
@entity18 said that the restaurant where she has her birthday lunch each year is right across the road from @entity14 , which may prove tempting			2
' i think i 've done my dash			0
the birthday lunch get - togethers are always so nice though , so maybe i will get another one later , ' she said			0
