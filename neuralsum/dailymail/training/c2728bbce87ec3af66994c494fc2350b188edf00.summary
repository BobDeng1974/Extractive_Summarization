@entity0 and wife @entity1 have agreed to switch on family - friendly internet filters at their homes to protect their three children from online pornography sources said mr @entity0 had already decided to install parental controls – and believes it is right that all couples make an ‘ active choice ’ between them on whether to do the same			1
mr @entity0 said it was up to each family to make their own decision , but suggested that he thought those with children should opt to block adult material			1
the filters will apply to all devices linked to a home @entity33 and across public networks where children are likely to be present			2
adult content filters are expected to be fitted to all new mobile phones			2
only an adult will be able to switch the filter on and off and the account holder will receive a confirmation email			1

the @entity48 ’s biggest internet service providers , who are responsible for connections in about 95 per cent of homes , agreed to sign up to the scheme after months of discussion with the government			1

however , the government ’s initiative has been criticised by some , including planning minister @entity83 , who argued adults should be free to enjoy ‘ legal ’ pornography without lecturing from ministers			0
‘ as a conservative , my starting point is that people should be free to live their lives as they choose			0
i am not going to start lecturing consenting adults about their private enjoyment of legal pornography , ’ mr @entity83 said			1
but mr @entity0 told @entity95 : ‘ i ’m not lecturing in that way			1
‘ what i ’m saying is that as a parent and as a politician , i think other parents would welcome the fact that when you sign up to an online account , you get a prompt so that you have to think about whether you want an internet in your house where your children can sometimes accidentally or on purpose search for pornographic images			0
’ he added : ‘ it ’s certainly not lecturing people on what to do , it ’s helping them with something that people continually say to me “ we ’d like some help with ”			0
’ mr @entity0 was challenged over how couples will agree on web access , if a husband wants the filters switched off and a wife wants to block pornography			1
the prime minister said : ‘ well , they ’re going to have to have a discussion , are n’t they ? ‘ the fact is , i think what ought to happen here and what is going to happen now is when you sign up to an internet service provider … you are prompted with an online message which is , there are these pornography filters that are switched on			0
‘ if you want to keep them , go ahead , particularly if you ’ve got children in the house			0
if you want to take them off , you have to make an active choice			2
’ mr @entity0 described the move , supported by @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 , as ‘ real progress ’ for parents			1
