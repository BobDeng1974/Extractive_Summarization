@entity0 beat @entity1 by 48 runs in a thrilling end to the first test at @entity5 on saturday , with @entity6 picking up seven wickets after @entity8 scored an inspired century for the visitors			1
a match that had begun in high emotion after the death last month of @entity14 batsman @entity13 ended in high drama after an absorbing final day in @entity0			2
set 364 to win after @entity0 declared on their overnight score of 290 - 5 , @entity1 seemed to be on their way to an unlikely victory after a brilliant 141 from @entity8 and a gritty 99 from opener @entity21			1
@entity6 of @entity0 is mobbed by @entity14 team - mates as they celebrate winning the first test @entity25 whirls away after taking the final wicket and earning his side the unlikeliest of wins against @entity1 @entity25 appeals as he takes the wicket of @entity21 with the game turning rapidly on day five @entity25 finished with stunning figures of 7 for 152 as @entity1 blew their advantage away on the final day @entity8 trudges off after being dismissed during his first test match as @entity1 captain but @entity25 , a former groundsman at @entity5 , turned the match the home team 's way with his offspinners , as @entity1 's tail collapsed and the tourists were bowled out for 315			1
@entity25 finished with 7 - 152 , giving him 12 wickets for the match , a career - best , and giving the @entity14 the early advantage in the four - match series , which resumes in @entity50 next week			2
@entity8 , in his first match as @entity54 captain , almost won the match single - handledly for his country			0
he scored centuries in both innings and dominated @entity0 's bowlers on a pitch favouring spin			0
his career - best 141 came off just 175 deliveries and featured 16 fours and one six			0
he also shared a third wicket partnership of 185 with @entity66 , who made half - centuries in each innings but fell agonisingly short of a deserved hundred			0
@entity8 had been in brilliant knick , scoring a career - best 141 off just 175 balls as they chased victory @entity8 consoles @entity21 as the opener threw his wicket away on 99 - the catalyst for a batting collapse with @entity1 seemingly in control at 242 - 2 after tea , @entity21 suddenly had an attack of nerves and threw his wicket away with a rash attempt to reach triple figures , trapped lbw by @entity25 after swiping at the ball			1
his departure triggered a catastrophic batting collapse as @entity1 lost their last eight wickets for just 73 runs with @entity25 the chief destroyer			1
@entity8 continued to play a lone hand but when he mistimed a pull shot and was caught in the deep , the end came quickly for the visitors			0
@entity0 's win did come at cost , however , with captain @entity99 limping off the field with a hamstring problem that he said would likely keep him out for the remainder of the series .			0

@entity6 takes a seven - wicket haul against @entity1 on day five
@entity0 beat the tourists in an *exciting* first test in @entity109
