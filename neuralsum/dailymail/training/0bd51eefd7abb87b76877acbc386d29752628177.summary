@entity3 , although neutral , had in fact gone out of its way to aid the @entity12 , who would rely on the country for much of its iron ore during the war			1

he writes : ' if you can arrange a private conversation with @entity155 you can give him my greetings and tell him there are two things i want to experience , and those are : that the @entity12 get hunted out of @entity2 and , secondly , that i get to live long enough to give him and his entire government a proper dressing down – maybe even his entire party			0
