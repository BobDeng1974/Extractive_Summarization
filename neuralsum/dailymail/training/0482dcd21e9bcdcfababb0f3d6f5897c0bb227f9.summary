by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 has proven it 's not just about coffee and cricket after it was named @entity7 's third most liveable city , drawing praise for its public transport and low crime rates			1
the @entity12 capital was knocked off its 2013 second - place perch by @entity14 , @entity15 - which climbed two spots from last year			1
@entity17 trailed behind in 11th place and @entity19 made its debut at spot number 25			1
@entity2 came in third place on @entity7 's 25 most livable cities known for its coffee and cricket , @entity7 cited @entity2 's public transport , low crime rates and ' compelling ' weekend paper as big pluses @entity31 's @entity30 held onto its top spot for a second year in a row			1
the @entity35 - based magazine cited @entity2 's recent upgrades to its public transport system , its low crime rate and even its inclusion of ' a compelling new weekend paper ' as reasons why it made the top - three cut			1
but according to @entity7 , @entity2 had the highest murder rate on its index of 25 cities			1
just over half way down the list , @entity17 - which held ninth place last year - took a tumble for its public transport woes and bar lockouts introduced in early 2014 in parts of the city after the ' king hit ' death of @entity56			1
but the @entity53 still held a special place in @entity7 's heart			2
' @entity17 remains @entity60 's face to the world - and a pretty one at that , ' it said			0
' architectural breakthroughs such as the @entity64 and one @entity65 are welcome additions			0
' @entity19 came to the attention of the international list maker after it was named as the host city of november 's @entity72 summit			0
' arriving delegates will discover a sun - drenched destination with a flourishing start - up scene , ' @entity73 said of the @entity79 capital			0
but despite the comprehensive criteria used to assess the cities from mobile phone charging points to the number of fast food chains to the amount of rubbish recycled , there is some data that can be called into question			0
@entity17 fell two places from last year because of its poor public transport and bar lockouts @entity19 ( left ) made its debut on the list at 25 , mainly oweing to its famously good weather , while @entity2 's public transport ( right ) was listed as one of its biggest selling points the publication claims @entity17 enjoys 2592 ' sunshine hours ' , not offering a timeframe			1
but according to the @entity104 , @entity103 recorded an average of 7.8 hours of sun a day in 2013 , which works out to be 2847 hours a year			0
@entity7 also listed @entity17 had only 42 book shops but a directory search reveals there are at least 188 listed in the @entity110 alone			2
the number of daily newspapers in a city is also taken into account - four in @entity17 and three in @entity2 - but the magazine ignores that millions get their news fix online			2
@entity31 's @entity30 clenched top spot with its easy lifestyle and peaceful surroundings it was followed closely by @entity14 , @entity15 in second place with its arts and foodie scenes surprisingly old favourites @entity35 and @entity125 were a no - show on the @entity7 rankings , with the magazine cheekly writing @entity35 police ' ca n't always be trusted ' and did not elaborate			1
topping the list was @entity30 for its easy living and cosmopolitan , but down - to - earth , atmosphere			0
' living in @entity30 is easy			0
it ’s pretty safe , it ’s simple to get around whether you walk or ride your bicycle and you have a lot of good restaurants , bars , cinemas , museums , parks , canals and beaches , ' @entity73 said			0
' it has an international – though local – feel to it ; living there you consider yourself a part of the world but still very @entity31			0
' second place getter , @entity14 , secured its spot with a great food , arts and shopping scene .			2

@entity2 takes third place , @entity17 11th and @entity19 makes debut at 25
@entity30 is number one for second year in a row and @entity14 behind it
@entity7 says the @entity12 capital is not just about coffee and cricket
transport , low crime rate and a weekend paper was why it made the cut
