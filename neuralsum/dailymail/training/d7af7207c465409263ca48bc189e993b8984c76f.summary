expectant parents who can not wait to hold their new child can now buy a three - dimensional model of the foetus to cradle and show friends			1
@entity6 inventors have devised a way to transform the commonplace ultrasound scan into an anatomically correct resin replica for parents to handle and keep as a memento			1
the nine - centimetre ( 3.6 - inch ) resin model of the white foetus , encased in a transparent block in the shape of the mother 's body , is fashioned by a 3d printer after an mri scan			1
expectant parents in @entity6 who ca n't wait to show the world what their baby will look like can now buy a 3d model of the foetus to pass around their friends @entity27 , the company offering the ' shape of an @entity30 ' model , even offers parents a miniature version which could be a ' nice adornment to a mobile phone strap or key chain			1
' @entity36 , of @entity27 , said : ' as it is only once in a lifetime that you are pregnant with that child , we received requests for these kind of models from pregnant women who ... do not want to forget the feelings and experience of that time			0
' the ' shape of an @entity30 ' costs 100,000 yen ( or around £ 760 ) , and the company said the ideal time for a scan is around eight or nine months into the pregnancy			1
the company also offers the acrylic resin scan as a small charm ' perfect for hanging from a mobile phone or key chain ' for those who would like a less pricey version , the company will start offering a 3d model of the face of the foetus at 50,000 yen - £ 380 - in december			1
it will use ultrasound images taken at a medical clinic in @entity68 that has forged a tie - up with the company			2
@entity27 , originally a supplier of devices including 3d printers , uses a layering technique to build up three - dimensional structures			2
the company also produces 3d models of internal organs that can be used by doctors to plan surgery or by medical students for training , a spokesman said			2
it is also possible that models can be used in hospitals to better inform patients what their problems are , instead of relying on difficult - to - understand diagrams			0
the technology ' realises not only the form but also texture of the model -- for example making it hard or soft ' , the firm said			0
' by making a model that is similar to a real organ or bone , one can simulate operations and practise different surgical techniques			0
' @entity36 said the company hit upon the idea of making 3d models of unborn babies in the hope that people would become more aware of the technology			0
but there are medical benefits too			0
the company said some medics could also foresee diagnostic possibilities with the models that may help predict difficulties in the birthing @entity115 - dimensional printers have been around for several decades but advances in the technology mean it is now gaining in popularity in several fields			2
soon the company will be offering parents a model of their unborn child 's face the machines work in a similar way to an inkjet printer , but instead of ink they deposit layers of material on top of each other , gradually building up the product they are making			1
where traditional manufacturing only becomes efficient with economies of scale because of the need to produce moulds , 3d printing is capable of producing single copies of relatively complicated objects			0
the technology is not yet advanced enough to build telephones or computers but it is already used to make components .			0

the scan and model cost 100,000 yen - around £ 760 - from a @entity6 company
the model is even available in a miniature version ' perfect for a key chain '
soon parents will also be able to order a replica of just the face of their foetus too
