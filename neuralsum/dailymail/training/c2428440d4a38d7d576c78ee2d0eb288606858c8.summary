by @entity1 reporter a theater in @entity3 , @entity4 , has won praise for its response to a letter from a mother who complained about a kissing scene between two male characters			1
the unnamed woman , who visited the @entity12 with her teenage son , called a performance of the 1978 play deathtrap ‘ offensive and vulgar ’ and its kiss scene an ‘ explicit , homosexual display ’			1
but an eloquent response from the theater questions why she is more upset by the characters ’ display of affection than their on - stage killing sprees			2
speaking out : @entity24 , the managing director of the @entity12 ( left , next to artistic director @entity25 ) has written a letter in response to an angry patron @entity24 , the @entity12 ’s managing director , wrote : ‘ you object to the kissing , but not to the fact that they ’re murderers ? you are comfortable with your son witnessing an enacted murder , but not a same - sex kiss ? in both cases , it ’s just make - believe , but how is a play that depicts murder , whether it ’s a contemporary murder - mystery like @entity39 or an immortal tragedy like @entity41 , morally acceptable while the depiction of a fairly innocuous , albeit same - sex kiss , is totally unacceptable ? ’ he offered to refund the woman for her tickets and said that he would place a ‘ do not contact ’ tag on her records			1
mr @entity24 , who posted both the woman ’s letter and his response to the company ’s @entity52 page , has been applauded for his words			1
his response was hailed as ‘ perfect ’ by commenters and ‘ beautifully handled ’ , while others pointed out that the woman could have easily researched the plot synopsis prior to attending with her son			0
scenes from the controversy : the anonymous patron had taken her son to see @entity39 , a scene of which is reenacted above posting to @entity52 : mr @entity24 posted the complaint to the @entity12 's @entity52 along with his response the woman ’s initial letter took issue with the fact that the @entity12 did not flag @entity39 as a play containing sexual scenes			1
‘ i have never been so disgusted and infuriated ! , ’ she wrote			0
i had read and reread the content advisory to make sure it would be suitable to have my teenage son attend			0
i anticipated that he would appreciate the suspense , intrigue , plot twists , and mystery			0
the decision on the theatre ’s part not to divulge repulsive content was irresponsible and negligent ! you have that responsibility to your patrons			0
she is not alone in these opinions			0
@entity89 , a media watchdog in @entity3 , told @entity92 news in their coverage of the controversy : ‘ somewhere i ’d like some standardization before taking my kids to live theater			2
