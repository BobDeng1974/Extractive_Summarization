a beekeeping dog has been trained to sniff out a killer disease which wipes out hives and even has his own suit to protect him from stings			1
@entity7 the black labrador was specially trained by beekeeper @entity8 to detect by smell a killer bee disease called @entity12 foulbrood			1
but mr @entity8 was forced to design him his own beekeepers suit after he kept getting stung while saving the buzzing insects			1
@entity7 the black labrador ( pictured in his special suit ) has been trained by beekeeper @entity8 a beekeeping dog is creating a buzz with a special outfit designed to protect him from stings now , the dog has to suit up every time he goes out to the hives			1
the beekeeper , from @entity28 in @entity29 , created the incredible suit after a long process of trial and error			1
mr @entity8 said : ' the process of training @entity7 and developing the suit has been an attempt to find a better way of controlling @entity12 foulbrood disease			1
' there is no cure for the disease			2
@entity8 created the special suit ' detection and quarantine processes are essential to save our bees			1
' i realised that @entity7 was able to sniff out the disease , and save thousands of bees - but he did n’t like being around them too much when he was getting stung			1
' so i ’ve tried to develop a suit the dog can wear and hopefully avoid being stung			1
' the suit is created to protect the dog as it attempts to detect the devastating disease which wipes out thousands of beehives every year			1
the fatal @entity57 larvae caused by the infection are usually only visible under high - magnification microscope , but thanks to @entity7 ’s mesh protected nose , that ’s not necessary			2
the dare - devil dog is protected from bee attack to let him get close enough to sniff out the hives			2
after a lengthy training regime @entity7 was ready to take on the challenge and began detecting the disease			1
mr @entity8 said : ' we ’ve now proven the concept , he can find the infected hives			1
' the only challenge now is getting the dog comfortable with the suit			2
it ’s hard to change a dog ’s habits overnight			2
' to fully cover a dog up and expect it to do the same thing , it takes time to change how he behaves and to get used to that suit			2
' but he ’s a quick learner and he ’s never let us down before			0
' @entity89 is caused by a spore forming bacterium called @entity57 larvae			0
these spores are the infective stage of the disease and infection begins when food contaminated with spores are fed to larvae by the nurse bees			0
once in the gut of the larva the spores germinate , bateria move into the larval tissues , where they multiply enormously			0
@entity89 is caused by a spore forming bacterium called @entity57 larvae infected larvae normally die after the cell is sealed and millions of infective spores form in their remains			0
spores are very resistant to extremes of heat and cold and to many disinfectants			0
the most common method of transmission from infected hive to healthy hive is the beekeeper			0
the spores can easily transferred , if frames of honey or brood are moved between hives , or if other contaminated equipment is used			0
however , robbing by adult bees of dead or dying infected colonies is also an important mode of transmission			0
if left to run its course , all colonies infected with @entity89 will eventually die from the disease			0
all infected colonies are normally destroyed			0
the first stage is to destroy the adult bees and brood combs by burning , then the hives and any appliances are sterilised by scorching with a blow lamp .			0

@entity7 the black labrador has been trained by beekeeper @entity8
he can detect by smell a killer bee disease called @entity12 foulbrood
the dog kept being stung so mr @entity8 made it a special suit
