by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 20 february 2013 updated : 06:59 est , 20 february 2013 true love : @entity2 suffered two strokes by the age of 30 , but says her ordeal helped her meet her husband @entity6 a woman who suffered two strokes before the age of 30 - defying odds of a billion to one - has finally found love thanks to her illness			1
@entity12 had suffered the first at 28 and doctors had said the chances of her suffering a repeat stroke were about a billion to one - but she was hit again			1
being unable to work because of the effects of the strokes , @entity12 's confidence was at rock bottom			1
she was a sociable 28 - year - old working for a travel firm in @entity24 and travelling all over the world when her own world was turned upside down			1
missing the buzz of the office , she logged on to an internet chatroom and began a conversation with a man over their shared love of football and rock music			1
they arranged to meet for a cinema date and just 10 months later @entity12 and @entity6 got engaged and the pair are now husband and wife			1
@entity12 , now 37 , says she is finally returning to her old self , thanks to @entity6 , 46			1
she said : ' he is all my good luck rolled into one			0
' ' i was having breakfast with my friends and my arm felt a bit strange , but i thought i had just slept on it in a funny way			0
' i remember i could n't open the butter sachet , but i did n't think much of it			0
' but when i went to work , a couple of people asked if i had done something to my arm			0
' after lunch i had dribbled down the side of my mouth			0
so i did what every sensible girl does - i called my mum			2
she told me to go straight to the doctor			0
@entity12 was immediately sent to the @entity65 in @entity24 and only discovered what had happened when she looked up and saw a sign for ' stroke ' on the hospital unit			1
the then 28 - year - old had suffered a haemorrhagic stroke , which results from a weakened vessel that ruptures and bleeds into the surrounding brain			1
it accounts for about 13 per cent of stroke cases			2
she said : ' when you are 28 you do n't think it is going to happen			2
they said the chances of it happening again were a billion to one			2
' however , almost exactly a year later , she suffered a second stroke			1
it was caused by scar tissue coming off the original tear that cause the first stroke			2
almost exactly a year after her first stroke , @entity12 suffered a second attack she said : ' the second stroke affected my voice , although only people who knew me before would notice			1
i believe it is the tone that has changed			0
' i no longer sing in the church group i was once part of and sometimes when i say something meant as a joke the tone does n't change and what i said can be taken the wrong way			0
' i have a general weakness down my left side and walk with a slight limp			0
i also ca n't really use my left arm at all now			0
' it was after suffering the second stroke , @entity12 turned to an internet chatroom for company and struck up her friendship with @entity6 , which eventually blossomed into love			1
the couple are now happily married , living in @entity114 , near @entity24 , and hoping for a family			2
@entity12 said : ' @entity6 was n't fazed by my condition			1
he does so much for me , helping me cook and dress			0
' when we got engaged i wanted to share my exciting news and show off my ring but i had to use my right hand to lift up my left hand to show the ring , which kind of spoiled the moment			0
' before i had the strokes i was a completely different person			0
thanks to @entity6 i 'm now finally getting back to that			2
' @entity12 's new - found confidence will be tested next month when she takes part in a terrifying charity challenge			1
she has bravely agreed to take part in the @entity133 's @entity132 event on march 23 , which will see participants ' swing ' off the 150ft @entity137 , @entity138 , and out over the @entity139			0
@entity12 aims to raise hundreds of pounds for the charity			2
