by @entity0 , deputy political editor published : 16:05 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 11:00 est , 28 november 2012 vote : @entity1 will tell mps tomorrow the @entity3 is willing to vote for @entity6 @entity5 non-member status @entity3 is preparing to recognise @entity8 as a state in its own right , senior officials have revealed			1
foreign secretary @entity1 will tell mps tomorrow that the @entity3 is willing to vote in favour of @entity6 having non-member status at the @entity5 if their leaders agree to re-enter peace talks with @entity16			1
@entity6 leader @entity17 has decided to push ahead with the vote on thursday despite fears that it will stoke further tensions with @entity16 after violence erupted in @entity23 earlier this month			1
@entity3 diplomats have urged mr @entity17 not to push for the vote			1
but mr @entity1 is expected to use a statement to @entity27 tomorrow to offer qualified backing for the @entity6			0
in a major strategic shift in @entity3 foreign policy , the foreign secretary will say @entity3 would vote yes if mr @entity17 agrees to re-enter talks with @entity16 without preconditions			1
the @entity3 is also calling on the @entity6 to ditch calls for the jurisdiction of the @entity37 to include @entity16 , which is opposed by the @entity16 government			1
failure to tweak their motion would lead to @entity3 abstaining in thursday ’s landmark vote			2
but mr @entity1 is prepared to offer @entity3 backing after @entity44 today announced that it would support the @entity6			1
‘ this thursday or friday , when the question is asked , @entity44 will vote yes , ’ foreign minister @entity46 announced in the @entity47			1
a yes vote by the @entity50 , which includes all 193 nations in the @entity5 , would not grant @entity8 full statehood – that would require a motion to be passed in the @entity54 – but it would be a major step towards that goal			2
the @entity6 are expected to win the @entity50 vote easily if it goes ahead and the @entity3 does not want to stand in its way			2
mr @entity1 will make clear that @entity3 support would not necessarily extend to backing full statehood in a @entity54 vote , which would almost certainly be vetoed by the @entity62			0
the @entity62 say @entity6 statehood must be achieved by negotiation and has called on @entity17 to return to peace talks that collapsed in 2010 over @entity16 settlement construction in the occupied @entity67			1
support : @entity6 leader @entity17 , right , has decided to push ahead with the vote , which the @entity44 foreign minister @entity46 , left , has said @entity44 will support but the suggestion that the @entity3 is prepared to give the @entity6 observer status is a major sea change in @entity3 diplomacy which has focused for years on balancing friendships with both @entity16 and the @entity6			1
a senior government source said : ‘ we are talking to the @entity6 and suggesting they could make some changes to the resolution which would minimise the negative effects on the peace process			0
in that case we would be minded to vote @entity32			0
‘ there are concerns about the jurisdiction of the @entity37			0
we ’ve made clear there ’s no automatic connection between what happens in the @entity50 and the @entity54			0
most importantly , we would like @entity17 to re-enter negotiations without preconditions			0
‘ we do n’t think this is the right time for this vote but , given that the @entity6 seem set on it , if they move in that direction we would be inclined to support them			0
if they do n’t we will probably abstain			0
’ mr @entity1 is leading intensive diplomatic efforts to avoid the total collapse of the peace process			0
in recent days he has spoken to mr @entity46 and to president @entity17			0
@entity3 diplomats are working urgently in @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			0
tension : there are fears the vote could stoke further tension with @entity16 , l following the ceasefire , which was celebrated by @entity6 , pictured violence : about 160 @entity6 people were killed in the eight day offensive in @entity23 that has sparked renewed international debate over @entity8 's @entity5 status a @entity115 spokesman said : ‘ the only way to give the @entity6 people the state that they need and deserve , and the @entity16 people the security and peace they are entitled to , is through a negotiated two - state solution			1
‘ we continue to advise president @entity17 against attempts to win @entity6 observer state status at the @entity50 because it would make it harder to secure a return to negotiations , and could have very serious consequences for the @entity131			2
‘ but precisely because of the possible reactions of the @entity133 and @entity16 , we must move heaven and earth to prevent the vote setting back the peace process and use our vote in whatever way we think will best assist progress towards a negotiated two state solution			2

the foreign secretary will tell mps tomorrow that @entity3 will vote for @entity6 @entity5 non-member status
comes despite fears @entity6 leader @entity17 ' push for vote to increase tensions with @entity16
@entity44 already announced it will back @entity8 in thursday 's vote
