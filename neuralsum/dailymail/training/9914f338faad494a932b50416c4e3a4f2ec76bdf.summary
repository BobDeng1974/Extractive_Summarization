by @entity1 reporter published : 06:41 est , 27 june 2012 updated : 06:52 est , 27 june 2012 a boy with an inoperable brain tumour is using a special camera to help him remember what he 's been up to each day			1
@entity6 , nine , from @entity7 , @entity8 , was diagnosed after suffering vomiting and headaches on a summer holiday in @entity12 last year			1
his condition improved after a course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy , but the treatment has left him with very poor short - term memory			0
he now wears a ' sensecam ' round his neck to help him remember what has happened throughout the day			1
@entity6 's mother @entity22 said the @entity19 helped him to recall events from the day before sensecam : this image shows how the device records pictures based on changes in temperature and movement it automatically takes 2,000 or more pictures a day , triggered by a change in temperature , movement , or lighting , or on a frequent timer function			1
@entity6 can then look at the pictures to trigger and reinforce memories			1
his mother @entity22 , 36 , from @entity40 , said : ' some days @entity6 can do things and the next he ca n't			2
he will be doing sums one day , then he ca n't another day			2
' it can be frustrating when he has learned things			0
he is very good with names and remembers things that were exciting or funny			0
' he remembers what the @entity19 is			2
he keeps turning it to face himself to get on the pictures			0
' we are extremely lucky			0
we have met so many other people who have n't been so fortunate			0
' @entity6 will use the camera on a holiday to @entity54 @entity6 's parents are planning a holiday on the @entity54 island of @entity58 this summer and they are hopeful and excited that the camera will help @entity6 remember the visit			1
the tumour initially left @entity6 paralysed and unable to speak , but he is now able to walk with supervision and can speak again			2
@entity63 paid for the Â£ 300 camera after @entity6 's parents , @entity22 and @entity66 , wrote to them			1
a stroke in 2009 left the youngster weak down his left side and he is partially blind , but mrs @entity70 said he is a very happy boy who loves school , playing with @entity72 and tractors			0
doctors continue to scan the tumour every three to four months to make sure it is not growing			0
rotary club president @entity77 said : ' when @entity22 contacted us , we were delighted that we were able to purchase this vital equipment			0
' all of us hope that it will aid @entity6 's recovery further and greatly improve his and his family 's lives			1

@entity19 is hung around @entity6 's neck and takes around 2,000 pictures a day
he can then flick through them to trigger memories
