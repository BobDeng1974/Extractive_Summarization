it 's the perfect setting : millions of tons of dirt , plenty of space and an atmosphere that stays at a constant 58 degrees			1
a new underground bicycle park with miles of dirt trails , jumps and stunt courses is being built inside an abandoned limestone mine in @entity10 , @entity11 , that has been recycled into a popular tourist attraction			1
the owners of the 320,000 - square foot park say it will be the largest indoor course in the nation			1
' you ca n't duplicate it			0
somebody would have to go out and dig rock for 40 years before they have what we 've got here			0
' @entity38 and the other owners started out using the mine 's nearly one million square feet of underground space as a dumping site for dirt and rock in the early 1990s , and later as a storage site for businesses			1
about five years ago , they installed zip lines in a section of the mine and in recent years set up a drive - thru underground @entity61 light show that draws long lines of cars during the holidays			2
two decades of dumping gradually built the floor up over time , and gave the owners plenty of earth to work with			2
@entity38 said there were requests from visitors and bikers to build a bike park in the mine			1
three , two , one , lift - off ! workers have been busy sculpting the earth into jumps and ramps in high demand : @entity38 , who co-owns the former mine , now called the @entity40 , said there were requests from visitors and bikers to build a bike park sheltered : indoor bike parks like @entity86 's @entity85 in @entity87 allow bikers to ride during cold winters , and @entity38 said he expects the @entity40 's park to be busiest in the coldest months geared up : bike riders @entity92 , left , and @entity93 walk their bikes during a test run through a new underground bike park looking around the vast space spread over five football fields , with dirt trails unfolding in every direction under a 35 - foot - high ceiling , the course has the breadth and feel of an outdoor space			1
indoor bike parks like @entity86 's @entity85 in @entity87 allow bikers to ride during cold winters , and @entity38 said he expects the @entity40 's park to be busiest in the coldest months			1
the difference is the trails at @entity86 's and other indoor parks are typically built with wood			0
@entity111 in @entity112 is all dirt but it is much smaller than the @entity10 park			2
' the dirt is a lot smoother for the steeper jumps , which we really like , ' said @entity93 , a local rider who has been invited in to test out the course			0
innovative business idea : @entity38 , center , co-owner of a new underground bike park , talks with riders @entity93 , left , and @entity124 inside the park still more work to do : the course is expected to be open to the public in march into the darkness : the @entity40 - approximately 100 acres - was mined from the early 1930s to the early 1970s ' plus being able to ride on dirt in the winter , it 's just something we typically ca n't do here in @entity11 , because the ground freezes and thaws , it 's just too messy			1
' two course designers from @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 , were brought in and began designing the course in october			0
@entity142 designed the @entity111 course			0
' we brought them in and said here 's the canvas , paint it the way you would like to see it done , ' @entity38 said			2
it has long smooth stretches for take - it - easy riders , steep jumps for daredevils and plenty of rocks and other physical obstacles to ride around and on top of			0
the course is expected to be open to the public in march			0
piled high : over 850,000 truck loads of backfill have been delivered so far to the cave to raise the floor up to the level that it is at today what lies above : approximately 70per cent of the @entity171 is located above the cavern			0

' we have a very large area to work with , ' said @entity38 , who co-owns the former mine , now called the @entity40
the 320,000 - square foot bike park in @entity10 is set to open in march
it 's pegged as the perfect setting : millions of tons of dirt , plenty of space and an atmosphere that stays at a constant 58 degrees
