excited : the prince told of his joy during a meeting with young entrepreneurs in south - east @entity8 enjoying the day : @entity3 could n't resist talking about his new grandchild despite warnings from the @entity61 although @entity3 appeared to enjoy being shown around the studio , when ms @entity51 's sister @entity64 , 26 , and mother @entity64 , 50 , were introduced , there was only one subject on their mind - @entity68 's pregnancy			1
@entity64 congratulated @entity3 first , with the royal skittishly replying : ' what did i do ? ' , before adding : ' it has n't arrived yet - ( but ) splendid , we 're very excited			2

fascinating stuff : during the visit , prince @entity3 heard from budding entrepreneurs supported by his charity good stuff : the prince was meeting young entrepreneurs supported by @entity49 today pro : prince @entity3 has plenty of experience and spent time with @entity24 's grandchildren over the summer she might be in the early stages of her second pregnancy but it seems the @entity68 has no intention of stopping there			1
according to friends , she wants three children by the age of 35 , which is why this second baby comes so soon after the birth of 13 - month - old @entity127			1
