the @entity0 has defended its rejigged loyalty programme after coming in for criticism from @entity4 fans during monday 's @entity6 qualifier in @entity7			1
over the summer plans were announced to alter the loyalty points system that rewards supporters for following the national team			1
the previous scheme , englandfans , saw supporters get two ' caps ' for following the team abroad and one for a match at @entity18			1
followers : @entity4 players celebrate with the travelling supporters after the 2 - 0 win over @entity7 mobbed : @entity4 players celebrate with @entity23 after he scored the second goal to wrap up the win however , that has been reversed under the new @entity27 , with those attending @entity18 matches getting two points as opposed to those making the effort to go abroad			1
' two caps for @entity18 , you 're having a laugh ' was chanted by supporters during @entity4 's 2 - 0 victory in @entity7 on monday , but the @entity0 has defended those changes			1
' our focus is on making @entity18 a home for @entity4 which means well - engaged , well - rewarded loyal fans fully supporting the emerging young talent that we have in the @entity4 team , ' an @entity0 spokesman said			1
' we want that team to enjoy playing in front of those fans at @entity18			2
' of course , we continue to be grateful for our amazing travelling support which is why we transferred all the caps previously earned by those supporters over to the new @entity27			2
' as such they will remain at the top of the priority list for tournament tickets if they continue to support @entity4 home and away , as many of them have done for many years			0
' crowded out : @entity58 attracts the attention of three @entity61 players that statement rankled with @entity63 , an @entity4 fan who travels home and away to matches including monday 's game in @entity67			0
he says those caps would have been automatically transferred under the pre-standing terms and conditions , pointing to the fact this issue is the tip of the iceberg			0
' those that travel away are the ones funding the supporters ' club as a whole through subscriptions and those people are doing it to get away and tournament tickets , ' @entity63 told @entity83			0
' getting to @entity18 is obviously easier than travelling to @entity84 and fans should be rewarded for their efforts			2
' the @entity0 can throw as many facts and figures about how they are ' engaging ' with us , but the simple fact is that two - thirds of the paying members from the last campaign have n't renewed - a poor performance in the @entity95 certainly is n't the only reason for that			0
' rather than trying to effectively bribe people who almost certainly would have gone to @entity18 anyway , thereby rendering the new changes completely ineffective , they should be reducing ticket prices for the array of unattractive fixtures we have coming up to get people through the turnstiles			0
' tussle : @entity108 and @entity109 battle for possession			0

previous scheme saw supporters get two ' caps ' for following the team abroad and one for a match at @entity18
supporters now get two points for attending games at @entity18
' two caps for @entity18 , you 're having a laugh ' was chanted by supporters who travelled to @entity7
