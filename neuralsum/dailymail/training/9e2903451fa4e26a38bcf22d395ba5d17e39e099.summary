@entity0 is rumoured to be acquiring a company that makes solar - powered drones			1
and while many people might be worried that the social network could spy on them from the skies , a more altruistic purpose is driving the company ’s acquisition bid			1
@entity0 is tipped to spend up to $ 60million on buying @entity10 - based @entity9 , which makes drones that can fly solo for five years without needing to land , in order to bring affordable internet access to some five billion people who do n’t have it			1
in april , @entity17 also acquired @entity9 , which is building solar - powered drones ( pictured ) to provide similar connectivity power : @entity9 's drone is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kw of electricity - it flies above the clouds , so it is exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours			1
wingspan and payload : 60 metres wide			0
the @entity28 carries a payload of 250 pounds			0
speed : cruising speed for the @entity28 is about 65 mph			0
function : the drone can be used for surveillance , crop - monitoring , weather and disaster oversight - or to provide communication , which is what @entity0 is said to be interested in			1
distance : the unmanned craft will have an operating range of over 2.8 million miles			0
@entity42 has reported that the social network , which is a backer of the @entity46 initiative , is interested in using some 11,000 high altitude drones to bring internet access to rural @entity49 and other parts of the world that are not connected			1
the company is said to be interested in using the @entity28 model , which is light - weight solar - powered and can fly at 65,000 feet for five years non-stop			1
the @entity28 unmanned aircraft is 60 metres wide and self - sufficient as it is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 @entity57 of electricity			2
@entity0 is a backer of the @entity46 initiative and is rumoured to be interested in using 11,000 high altitude drones to bring internet access to remote regions of @entity49 and other parts of the world that are not online			1
@entity65 's first call centre , which opened in 2005 , is pictured , but plenty of parts of the continent do not have internet access as it flies above the clouds , it is exposed to sunlight constantly during daylight hours and store energy for the night flight			0
the drones are described as ‘ atmospheric satellites ’ that could be used for surveillance , to monitor weather and communications			0
@entity0 is interested in the latter function and reportedly thinks the drones could be used to provide sustainable regional internet systems			2
a source told @entity42 that if @entity9 was acquired , all its drones would be used for the @entity46 project , which is competing with @entity17 ’s ‘ @entity88 ’			2
@entity17 ’s effort plans on using balloons instead of drones to bring internet access to rural and remote areas of the world			1
the @entity28 unmanned aircraft 9pictured ) is 60 metres wide and self - sufficient as it is covered in around 3,000 solar panels producing about 7 kw of electricity experts have pointed out that @entity0 ’s recent acquisition of @entity99 could be used to send messages in places with a weak and slow internet connection , while a data compression technology it bought , @entity104 , could be used so that functions need less transmitted data to make them work			1
while @entity0 ’s aim is altruistic , the company would also seem to be looking to the future , as by connecting communities , more people than ever before will get hooked on social media			2
@entity9 ’s @entity114 and @entity115 60 drones are currently demonstrator models that can be flown and are launched in catapult , but commercial versions are expected next year			2
they are designed to be cheaper than the cost of a satellite , while carrying out similar functions such as surveillance , crop - monitoring , weather and disaster oversight			0
the drones ( pictured ) are described as ' atmospheric satellites ' that could be used for surveillance , to monitor weather and communications			0
@entity0 is interested in using them to provide internet access to remote areas of land below the @entity135 's deputy president , professor @entity134 , said : ' the idea of using aerial platforms to deliver connectivity is one that is many decades old , from low - orbital satellites to balloons and more recently unmanned aerial vehicles			1
' ' the difficultly has always been one of keeping the aerial platform in the right place in the sky for weeks or months at a low enough cost			0
as technologies mature we get ever closer to achieving this and @entity0 's intervention in this space is a welcome boost to the area			0
' he warned that there are many challenges to overcome before the dream of providing internet access to remote communities via drone can be achieved			2
' top of the list is the need to make the drones cost - effective , reliable and demonstrate to the regulators that they can operate safely in our airspace			0
many other issues associated with access to radio spectrum , national telecoms regulations and more will also need to be addressed , ' he added .			0

@entity0 is tipped to buy @entity10 - based @entity9
the social network aims on *deploying* 11,000 high altitude drones to connect remote and rural parts of the world to the internet
the @entity28 drone is *lightweight* and solar - powered so it can fly at 65,000 feet for five years non-stop
