by @entity0 published : 11:40 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 12:24 est , 21 may 2013 the unique strain of potato blight which triggered the @entity5 potato famine in the mid- 19th century has been identified by scientists			1
the plant pathogen dubbed @entity8 has been identified from potato samples collected in 1847 at the height of the famine			1
the specimen , held at @entity13 , allowed scientists to decode the genome of a plant pathogen and its plant host from dried plant samples			1
the unique strain of potato blight which triggered the @entity5 potato famine in the mid- 19th century has been identified by scientists and named @entity21 - 1 molecular biologists from @entity23 and the @entity24 reconstructed the spread of the potato blight pathogen from dried plants which , although 120 to 170 - years - old , had many intact pieces of @entity29			1
the researchers found that the strain of blight originated in @entity33 during the @entity35 conquest of the @entity36 and evolved until it caused the massive crop failure in @entity5 three hundred years later			1
it has since died out after new disease resistant potato crops began to be planted at the turn of the last century			2
dr @entity42 from the @entity43 in @entity44 said : ‘ preserved plant samples represent a rich and untapped source from which we can learn a tremendous amount about the historical distribution of plants and their pests - and also about the history of the people who grew these plants			2
the researchers examined the historical spread of the fungus - like oomycete @entity57 , known as the @entity60 pathogen			0
a strain called @entity24 - 1 was long thought to have been the cause of the fatal outbreak but the researchers concluded a strain new to science was actually responsible			1
a strain called @entity24 - 1 was long thought to have been the cause of the fatal outbreak but the plant pathogen dubbed @entity70 has now been identified from potato samples collected in 1847 at the height of the famine while more closely related to the @entity24 - 1 strain than to other modern strains , @entity70 is unique			1
@entity76 , from the @entity77 in @entity78 , said : ‘ we have finally discovered the identity of the exact strain that caused all this havoc			0
‘ both strains seem to have separated from each other only years before the first major outbreak in @entity23			0
’ the researchers compared the historic samples with modern strains from @entity23 , @entity89 and the @entity90 as well as two closely related @entity92 species			0
the scientists were able to estimate with confidence when the various @entity92 strains diverged from each other during evolutionary time			0
the strain of blight originated in @entity33 during the @entity35 conquest of the @entity36 and evolved until it caused the massive crop failure in @entity5 three hundred years later the herb - 1 strain of @entity57 likely emerged in the early 1800s and continued its global conquest throughout the 19th century			1
only in the 20th century , after new potato varieties were introduced , was @entity21 - 1 replaced by another phytophthora infestans strain , @entity24 - 1			1
the scientists found several connections with historic events			0
the first contact between @entity23 and @entity24 in @entity33 in the sixteenth century coincides with a remarkable increase in the genetic diversity of @entity92			2
the social upheaval during that time may have led to a spread of the pathogen from its centre of origin in @entity118 , @entity33			2
this in turn would have accelerated its evolution			0
the potato blight specimen , held at @entity13 ( pictured ) , allowed scientists to decode the genome of a plant pathogen and its plant host from dried plant samples the international team came to these conclusions after deciphering the entire genomes of 11 historical samples of @entity57 from potato leaves collected over more than 50 years			1
because of the remarkable @entity29 quality and quantity in the samples , the research team could evaluate the entire genome of @entity57 and its host , the potato , within just a few weeks			0
dr @entity42 said : ‘ perhaps this strain became extinct when the first resistant potato varieties were bred at the beginning of the twentieth century			2
‘ what is for certain is that these findings will greatly help us to understand the dynamics of emerging pathogens			0
this type of work paves the way for the discovery of many more treasures of knowledge hidden in preserved plant samples			0

a strain called @entity24 - 1 was long thought to have been the cause
plant pathogen dubbed @entity21 - 1 now identified as cause of @entity5 potato blight
specimen held at @entity13 allowed scientists to decode the genome
@entity8 originated in @entity33 during the @entity35 conquest of @entity36
it has now died out because of the use of disease resistant potato plants
