the @entity0 is bracing itself for what could be one of the most thrilling top four races ever seen			2
with @entity4 seemingly ruling @entity5 out , it leaves five clubs chasing two remaining @entity8 spots , and even then the threat of @entity10 or @entity8 winners breaking hearts to add further confusion			0
so who will seal those top four spots ? let ’s work on the basis that @entity18 and @entity19 will finish in the top two			1
of course nothing is guaranteed at this stage , but it would take a brave person to bet against that happening			0
so let ’s look at those below ... it would take a brave man to bet against @entity18 and @entity19 occupying the top two slots come may @entity30 they wo n’t go away will they ? even with key players injured recently they have sustained their challenge			1
they ’ve been unlucky to lose @entity37 for so long and i ’m hoping he comes back as fit and strong as he was before his injury , but two things could prove to be @entity30 ’s undoing : firstly , @entity43 ’s goals are drying up			1
he ’s scored two in 15 @entity0 appearances – it had been six in nine before that			0
the other concern is that @entity30 have to go to both @entity18 and @entity19 in the run - in			1
@entity43 has found goals tough to come by of late , with his last @entity0 strike in december @entity51 has worked wonders on the south coast , with the @entity55 's side currently lying third @entity56 when the long - ball king calls you a long - ball team , he must be listened to			1
but @entity4 was merely furthering his claims to be the next @entity63 manager by trying to belittle @entity64			0
it wo n’t fool the intelligent football follower of course			0
@entity68 can mix it up , and find a way of getting a result when defeat looks certain			0
without ever really hitting the stride for the full 90 minutes in any game this season , @entity56 have somehow worked the way up from seventh place oblivion to the top four , albeit a precarious position there			2
they host @entity19 then go to @entity18 in back - to - back games in the middle of april before a run of five games to end the season where they face four sides currently in the bottom half of the table			1
the big clash in that final stretch is at home to @entity93 in the penultimate game , and that could almost be a play - off for a top four place			2
the big obstacle for @entity56 is that they ’re struggling to play fluent football , they have a heavy reliance on their goalkeeper , and without @entity106 they look less likely to win games			1
the star trio of @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 have yet to hit the heights the fitness of @entity106 ( second left ) is key to @entity56 's hopes of a top - four finish spurs in the next five weeks @entity117 go to @entity118 and @entity56 and those results could well determine whether they make it or not			1
they have match - winners in @entity123 and @entity124 who have proven already this season they can deliver in the big games and when under pressure			0
their weaknesses are obvious – they ’ve combined being the lowest scorers in the current top six with being the side which has conceded most			1
they give away some silly goals – @entity135 and @entity136 were both at fault for the @entity93 goal on saturday			2
there ’s nothing stopping @entity117 , apart from that unshakeable belief that they simply wo n’t do it , just like most seasons			0
@entity123 has been a revelation this season , scoring 22 goals in all competitions for a resurgent @entity117 @entity124 has also chimed in with eleven goals as the midfield maestro pulls the strings @entity93 weaknesses in this @entity93 side are numerous			2
any side that relies on @entity155 is asking for trouble , and when @entity158 defends like he did at @entity159 at the weekend , there is no hope			0
@entity161 can score a worldy against @entity163 , but struggles to convince when up against a side playing well			0
@entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 and others are all over-praised by @entity93 fans in the rather embarrassing hope they will convince themselves these players are truly going to be regulars in a side that will push to win the @entity0 title			2
the good news for @entity177 is that they always make the top four			0
with the exception of a trip to @entity181 in the middle of may all their tougher opponents have to come to the @entity185 , and @entity186 is back and makes a huge difference to how they play			2
i expect them to win fourth , and maybe even challenge for third as well			0
@entity186 has boosted @entity93 's hopes of making it 18 consecutive years of @entity8 football but @entity193 - winner @entity155 has not covered himself in glory with the @entity195 leaking goals @entity118 have they left it too late ? they ’re not losing games – their last defeat was in the middle of december			1
@entity203 and @entity204 picked up knocks against @entity206 and if either of those two are out for any length of time that could kill off the @entity209 ’ top four dreams			0
can @entity211 handle the pressure of being this season 's saviour ? before the round of midweek games @entity118 sit six points behind third - placed @entity30 with a far inferior goal difference			1
@entity220 ’ reliance on youth is admirable , with @entity222 an exciting new addition to the side			0
but can that youth sustain the quality needed in the big pressure games in the run - in when they go to @entity30 , @entity93 and @entity18 ? and do n’t forget their final game is at @entity232 , where they have won only once since @entity232 were promoted to the @entity0 in 2008			1
@entity203 , who has been offered a new @entity118 deal , is central to the club 's hopes of a top four finish @entity204 is also a key component of @entity220 ' side as they chase the @entity8 it ’s a tight contest , and it ’s going to be very exciting , but i ’m going to go for @entity93 and @entity56 to fill those top four spots .			1

assuming @entity18 and @entity19 will finish in the top two , we appear set for one of the best battles for the @entity8 places
five into two does not go , so who will miss out with @entity30 , @entity56 , @entity117 , @entity93 and @entity118 vying for the top four ?
@entity30 have seen @entity43 's goals dry up of late and have to travel to both @entity18 and @entity19
@entity56 are not playing fluently and will need @entity106 to stay fit
@entity117 are the lowest scorers and have conceded the most from the teams in the top six
@entity93 welcome most of their tough opponents to the @entity185
@entity118 's reliance on youth is admirable , but their run - in is a tough one
