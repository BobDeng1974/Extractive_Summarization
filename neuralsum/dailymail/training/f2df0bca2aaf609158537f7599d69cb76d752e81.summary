by @entity0 residents in @entity2 are furious after the city council spent £ 35,000 building @entity5 's most expensive bird nesting box , saying that the money could have been better spent elsewhere			1
the colourful 33ft - high steel tower was built in 2011 as part of a plan to reverse the decline in the number of swifts - a species which sees its population fall by three per cent each year due to a loss of habitat			1
but the hi - tech bird box has sat empty in a field for three years , with its first feathered inhabitants only moving in this summer			0
summer visitors : the steel structure , which was built in 2011 , features 200 nesting boxes for swifts			1
the birds spend most of the year in southern @entity25 , arriving in the @entity5 to breed between may and late july new home : a swift darts out of the tower on the outskirts of @entity2			1
the species nest in old buildings but have seen their numbers decline by three per cent each year as these buildings are renovated or demolished @entity36 sun : the colours of the nesting boxes were inspired by the sun in @entity25 - where swifts live for most of the year			1
@entity42 councillors say the specialist nest is helping to reverse the decline in the species the tower , which features 200 nesting boxes , was built at @entity50 ’s @entity49 nature reserve on the outskirts of @entity2 as part of a wider wetland habitat creation plan in 2011			1
it was commissioned by @entity54 and created by @entity56 - based artist @entity55 , who worked with ecologists and swift experts to combine design with a functional home for the birds			2
the design is inspired by the colours of the @entity36 sunset - where the birds live for most of the year - and recorded bird calls are played through loudspeakers built into the tower in order to attract young swifts			2
but some residents feel that the money , which was donated by housing developers to be used for public art , could have been used to benefit the local community			1
@entity74 , 43 said : ' i ca n’t believe they have spent so much money building a bird ’s nest			0
' the money would have been much better spent on facilities for the local community , such as a children ’s playground			2
' it ’s ridiculous that they have spent thousands building a nest which has n’t even been used for three years			0
' standing tall : the tower stands in @entity50 's @entity49 nature reserve on the outskirts of @entity2			0

it was designed by artist @entity55 , who worked with ecologists and swift experts to combine design with a functional home for the birds local volunteers from @entity117 worked with the council and the artist to create the specialist nest			0
councillor @entity121 said : ' this is fantastic news for this innovative project , which is helping biodiversity in the city by providing a habitat for this important species			0
' now the swifts have found it , it should provide a great spectacle every summer as the birds demonstrate their exhilarating flying skills around the tower			0
' @entity135 , nature conservation officer for @entity54 , said : ' although these young birds are not expected to breed this year , the activity is extremely encouraging and we predict breeders next year , following their return from @entity25			1
