after weeks of being hounded for a comment on the expected birth of the new royal baby , @entity0 has written an open letter to the media , warning of the harmful consequences of always seeking for a new angle on world events			1
the former @entity11 co-host , who shot to notoriety in 2012 after a prank call during the @entity15 's first pregnancy resulted in the death of the nurse who took the call , penned the letter to ask the media , ' have we not learnt enough from the royal prank call ? '			1
the 33 - year - old said in the letter that with the impending birth of the second child for the @entity26 and @entity15 , she understood the pressure of needing to find ' a new angle ' when providing coverage of news events , offering assurance that she had been in the same position			2
@entity51 of @entity52 is believed to be overdue by five days as she had been due to give birth last thursday @entity0 and fellow @entity11 co-host @entity54 posed as the @entity55 and prince @entity56 as part of the prank in 2012 to gain information about the @entity15 following the birth of @entity61			1
@entity62 was the nurse who took the call at @entity65 in @entity66 , taking her life two days later and blaming her decision on the actions of the @entity35 radio hosts			1
@entity0 has since revealed her personal torment over the prank , and was unable to return to her role on the air , saying earlier in the year that she felt ' the world hated [ her ] ' for what had happened			1
in the letter , @entity0 asks why the media continues to seek fresh angles for stories after seeing the consequences of her mistake , and asks various media outlets to learn from the tragedy of ms @entity87 's death and to be sensible when it comes to covering the birth of the second royal baby			1
' respect their privacy , stay away from the hospital and think of others when working out what angles to pursue			0
for anyone that is actually considering trying to repeat our stupidity from 2012 , do n’t , ' @entity0 wrote			1
she declared in the letter that there was no need for a fresh angle on the birth , as the fact that a new baby was being born was sufficient , and that her only response would be to congratulate the parents			2
@entity51 of @entity52 is believed to be five days overdue , and many fans and media have camped outside the @entity112 of @entity113 in @entity114 , where she will give birth			1
the 33 - year - old said that while she thought the media industry was ' wonderful ' , she said that there needs to be a ' line ' that is never crossed when reporting news			2
@entity0 goes on to recount the moment when her own family was hounded by someone she knew when her father and her whole street was ' doorknocked ' for information following the scandal in 2012			1
' i ’ve crossed the line too			2
but the difference is , i ’ve learnt from it and i ’ll continue to work in the media so i can help others to think before they act			2
you do n’t need to be careless to create great content , ' she finished			0

either way @entity15 - who plans to give birth at @entity113 in @entity114 , central @entity66 - is now overdue and may have already spoken to doctors about the possibility of being induced			1
earlier in the year , @entity0 spoke to @entity157 and spoke of her continual anguish over her actions in 2012			1
' i was in disgust with myself , i had failed as a human being , to be involved in someone 's death is horrific and it affected me greatly , ' she told @entity157 listeners			2
while ms @entity167 said that she now understands that ' there is more to mental health ... it 's not normally an event like that that can trigger someone to commit suicide , ' she experienced overwhelming guilt at the time			0
ms @entity167 said she had experienced deep depression for a year , and claimed that the event had changed her life permanently			0
last year , ms @entity167 said that she believed the incident would stay with her forever , but that she has done all she can do now that she has personally apologised to her family			0

it is thought their second child is now overdue the new royal baby 's big brother @entity61 was three days overdue when he was born on july 22 , 2013 ' i do n’t know how you completely forgive yourself – someone wrote my name in their suicide note , ' she told @entity193			1
' they thought of me before they took their own life and that will stay with me forever but i can move forward from that point i think because i 've tried to say sorry			0
' ' it was really tough but i made that promise to them over a year ago that if they wanted answers i would go to the inquest so i was always going to go , ' she said			0
' to be able to to look them in the eye and say sorry was incredibly hard but it ’s something i felt i needed to do – everyone was very emotionally involved in that room			0
' ms @entity167 now hopes she can try to move on with her life			0
' i do have a little bit more closure and i ’ve been finding it so hard to move forward and i think a lot of that had a lot to do with not being able to say sorry – just bearing that guilt and that blame , ' she said			0
' to know that i have done everything i can – i tried to help – i said sorry – i feel that i 've redeemed myself as much as i can and i hope they got the answers to find the closure as well			0

' some people were able to just move on from that – i was n’t – it deeply affected me for a long time and when you are the face of blame publicly you believe it , ' she said			0
' as well , knowing @entity242 herself has written my name in that suicide note and blamed me directly – you hold yourself responsible			2
' ms @entity167 spoke of how the incident had taken its toll on her over the past two and a half years			0
' it took every bit of strength and every bit of support to get through that but you have a choice you can keep fighting or you can let it just take you over and i wanted to fight - life is so precious , ' she said			0
' i wanted to try to get better and a part of that was going to the inquest and saying sorry and helping the family out so combined i feel i ’ve got everything so i can truly move forward			0
