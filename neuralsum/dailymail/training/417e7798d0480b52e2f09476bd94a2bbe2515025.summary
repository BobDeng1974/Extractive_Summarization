’ @entity4 is referring to the criticism the watch received when it went on sale in september last year			0
biometric experts at @entity43 - based firm @entity42 have created a dongle fitted with an iris scanner			1
the @entity47 device can register up to five different users			0
each user begins by scanning their eyes to take an image of their respective irises			0
these unique images are then translated into an encrypted code			0
the scan takes between 10 and 20 seconds and the authentication code is created immediately			0
once registered , each user can add various online passwords to their @entity47 profile			0
next time the user visits one of these accounts , instead of entering a password , they can scan their eyes for immediate and secure access			0
according to @entity42 , the @entity68 of the average fingerprint sensor , in which the system is hacked by an unknown print , is one in every 10,000 scans			0
for iris scans , this increases to one 1 in 2.25 trillion scans			0
@entity76 is set to go on sale before the summer and will cost around $ 250 ( £ 150 ) although an exact date and price is yet to be announced			0

@entity1 is said to be working on adding biometric technology to a future model in its @entity102 range of smartphones and tablets to rival the popular fingerprint scanner on @entity2 's @entity98 , pictured seeing double : two version of the @entity9 are expected to go on sale in april , a metal and a plastic version @entity1 is also set to unveil a second - generation @entity110 , original model is pictured , along with the @entity9 at @entity111 in february @entity113 scanning is more secure than fingerprint scanning , and the technology involved is cheaper , making it a more obvious choice to add to future models			1
@entity113 scanning involves a simple charge - coupled device digital camera that uses visible and near - infrared light to take a clear , high - contrast image of a person ’s iris			2
when the camera takes the image , a scanner plots the centre of the pupil , edge of the pupil , edge of the iris , eyelids and eyelashes			2
it then analyses the unique patterns in the iris and translates this pattern into a code			0
next time the eye is scanned , this code is compared to the pattern to authenticate a match			0
the iris scanner would not be the first time @entity1 has introduced eye - tracking technology			1
its @entity145 includes a feature that locks onto the movement and position of a user ’s eyes			2
the phone can analyse where the user is looking and will automatically scroll a web page when the eyes reach the bottom of the screen , for example , or lock the screen when the user looks away			0
