smartphones and social media are being harnessed by criminal gangs to send illegal sales of potentially dangerous sleeping pills , slimming tablets and @entity6 soaring smartphones and social media are being harnessed by criminal gangs to send illegal sales of potentially dangerous sleeping pills , slimming tablets and @entity6 soaring , according to @entity12 ’s drugs watchdog			1
the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) believes a combination of smartphones allowing people easier access to the internet , and ease of promotion via social media , has allowed illicit suppliers to target buyers more effectively			1
this year , the agency has targeted gangs ’ internet operations for the first time , removing 18,671 @entity29 videos directing viewers to websites illegally selling prescription and counterfeit drugs			1
despite their actions , the @entity13 reports a huge rise in black market sales of the drugs to people who may be too embarrassed to seek help from their doctor			1
over the course of 2014 , the agency seized 1.2 million doses of illegally - supplied erectile dysfunction drugs including @entity6 , 383,000 slimming products and 331,000 doses of sleeping pills , tranquillisers and anti-depressants			1
other drugs being sold illegally include hair - loss treatments , cognitive enhancers and anabolic steroids used by body builders			1
@entity55 , head of enforcement at the drugs watchdog , said : ‘ smartphones have allowed people greater access to the internet and all of a sudden this accessibility , combined with social media , has made a significant difference in how criminals reach consumers			1
‘ this is something we are looking at now in a serious way			0
there is a phenomenal market out there			0
’ raids organised by the @entity13 have found drugs stored in abysmal conditions , he added			2
mr @entity55 , a former detective superintendent who previously ran the @entity78 ’s child abuse investigation command centre , said : ‘ we ’ve had cases where there have been mouse and rat droppings around the blister packs			0
‘ these people are not interested in sanitary conditions , they are in it for the money			2
‘ besides the obvious risks of taking medicines made from rat poison and other substitutes used by gangs , there are also dangers in taking medicines without proper consultation			2
the @entity13 believes smartphones has allowed illicit drug suppliers to target buyers more effectively ( picture posed by model ) ‘ there are definitely health risks because a patient might have a condition that means they should not take a certain drug			1
’ mr @entity55 said patients viewing the @entity29 footage are directed to other sites purporting to be officially - registered pharmacies , which sell fake and potentially dangerous medicines			2
the @entity114 believes that about half of all drugs sold online are counterfeits			0
many of the treatments are out - of - date or have been contaminated due to storage in appalling , unhygienic conditions			0
the growth in illegal sales of prescription drugs is partly believed to be driven by the fact patients are unwilling to discuss certain embarrassing issues such as hairloss , being overweight or sexual dysfunction with their family doctor			1
instead they are resorting to seeking out their own cures online in the privacy of their homes			0
most of the drugs being sold originate from @entity139 or @entity140			0
@entity141 , director of the @entity142 in @entity143 , said : ‘ we are in a situation where internet usage is growing so fast that we are at risk of losing control			0
