by @entity0 a dog who has solved murder mysteries and put criminals behind bars is stepping down to make way for the next generation			1
@entity8 , a 13 - year - old springador - a @entity10 cross - has worked on more than 1000 cases with @entity12 as a fire investigation dog for the past seven years			1
she is trained to work out how fires started by using her advanced sense of smell to hunt for traces of the flammable liquids used to set buildings alight			1
@entity21 from @entity12 with @entity8 , a @entity10 cross , who has helped the team solve cases for the past seven years suited and booted : @entity8 wears protective footwear when she investigates a fire scene			1
but she 's hanging up her helmet and retiring after seven year 's service with the @entity31 fire squad a new generation of fire investigation dogs are moving in and here @entity12 handler @entity21 asks his dog to sniff out residues of fuel which may have been used to start a fire and she ’s been so successful she ’s even put people behind bars for murder			1
working with fire and police crime scene investigation teams she ’s managed to sniff out evidence leading to criminal convictions and prevent insurance fraud by proving a fire was started deliberately			0
her sense of smell is so strong that if you put a single drop of petrol at one end of a football pitch , @entity8 would be able to smell it from the other end			1
sometimes a trace of petrol is so small that bringing in @entity8 is the only chance of finding that vital piece of evidence			1
@entity62 , who belongs to handler @entity21 from @entity12 , searches a mock car crash in a practice session fire investigation dog @entity62 searches a mocked up fire scene for traces of where the blaze may have started @entity73 handler @entity21 and his dog @entity62 who helps sniff out evidence of how a fire started but @entity8 ’s story did n’t have the happiest of starts			1
after being badly trained as a gun dog she was given away by owners who did n’t want her any more			0
she eventually found herself in the hands of a dog trainer who noticed her special skills and passed her onto the @entity12			1
now at retirement age , @entity8 has hung up her helmet and will live out her days at home with handler @entity21 , his wife @entity89 , 37 , and two children @entity91 , nine , and @entity92 , three			1
the fire service wo n’t be left without a detective dog though , as mr @entity21 has trained @entity95 , a five - year - old @entity96 , and @entity62 , a 14 - month - old @entity98 @entity97 to carry on her work			2
mr @entity21 , from @entity12 , said : ‘ it ’s a pleasure to work with such a talented lovely - natured dog and i ’m so proud of what she ’s achieved			2
‘ we have done jobs where the evidence she has found has been instrumental in getting a conviction			0
‘ it ’s always nice to know that criminals would n’t have been brought to justice without our work			0
‘ it is a fantastic feeling knowing that your dog has gone there , played a game , and the result of that is that someone dangerous was taken off the streets			0
’ in april 2013 , @entity8 was brought to a fire in @entity122 , @entity123 , to try and shed light on how the blaze had started			2
the owner of the house , @entity126 , claimed robbers had started the fire , in which his wife @entity130 died , and their three daughters were injured			0
scene of the blaze : home in @entity122 , @entity123 when @entity8 investigated the interior of the house she found evidence that the fire was started on purpose but when @entity8 found traces of flammable liquid at the property , police were able to work out the real cause of the @entity147			2
it transpired that @entity126 had set fire to the family home in a bid to stop his daughet , @entity152 , from moving to @entity153 and marrying a policeman			0
he said she had brought ‘ dishonour on the family ’ , because he did not approve of her partner , before pouring gallons of petrol over his family home and setting it alight			0
when @entity152 ( pictured left ) , told her father @entity126 ( right ) she planned to move to @entity153 , he doused his home in petrol @entity130 died of carbon monoxide poisoning and one of his daughters , 16 - year - old @entity170 , who jumped from a bedroom window , suffered 50 per cent burns			2
he was found guilty at @entity173 of murdering his wife and arson but was cleared of attempted murder of his three daughters			0
during his trial the court heard how the father - of - six soaked seven parts of his home in petrol at about 5am as his family slept - only hours before @entity184 , 28 , was set to fly to @entity153 to marry the cid officer			0
after initially telling police the fire was started by ‘ a gang led by a white middle - aged woman ’ , he was convicted of murder and arson with intent and sentenced to life prison in october 2013 .			0

@entity8 has worked on more than 1000 cases with @entity12
the @entity10 cross has helped put criminals behind bars
@entity8 's *incredible* sense of smell allows her to sniff petrol a football pitch away
