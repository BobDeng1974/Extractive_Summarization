by @entity0 published : 13:36 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 14:24 est , 13 june 2013 a black @entity1 is recovering after she was shot up to 100 times with a bb gun			2
@entity5 was found wandering around @entity6 , @entity7 , two weeks ago when a good @entity8 took her to @entity9			1
there , vets discovered 80 - 100 bbs lodged in the dog 's face , back and legs			1
the one - year - old @entity1 , who has since been adopted , miraculously escaped any eye or organ damage and is doing well but @entity18 and the @entity19 are trying to track down her attackers			1
@entity21 : the @entity22 is looking for the culprits who covered one - year - old black @entity5 with pellets from a bb gun @entity27 veterinarian dr @entity26 , who treated @entity5 , said the bbs appear to be brass and therefore only need to be removed if they start to infect the dog 's skin			1
' she 's a lucky dog , ' @entity32 , @entity5 's new owner , told @entity34			1
' i mean , she does n't have any eye damage ... and she does n't seem to have any organ damage , so i think she 's going to have a wonderful life			1
i think i 'm very lucky			0
' dr @entity26 said he thought something was odd when he felt a bump on @entity5 's snout after she was first brought to authorities			2
riddled : an @entity44 , pictured , showed some 50 bbs in the animal 's head alone lucky : there were scores more in @entity5 's abdomen but she was lucky to get away relatively unharmed love : lady , pictured in an @entity44 , has since been adopted and is in the care of her new owner ' it was n't just another little lump			1
you could feel something that was hard and round , and it felt like a @entity59 , so we decided to take an x-ray , ' dr @entity26 told the station			0
one x-ray revealed 50 @entity64 in the dog 's head and another showed there were many more scattered throughout her body			2
' there are bbs everywhere			0
there is one pellet and multiple , multiple bbs , ' said dr @entity26			0
dr @entity26 said the dog appears to be happy and healthy enough but they 'll keep monitoring her to ensure she does n't develop any health concerns at a later date			2
wandering : the stray lab was found two weeks ago wandering in @entity6 , @entity7 , before she was taken to the @entity9 ' it still remains with @entity5 whether we are going to have to do anything about these bbs or not , ' he said			1
' right now , none of them pose any threat to her			0
we have also not done any lead levels or blood cell count to make sure there is no issue , and that â€™s probably on the docket			0
' meanwhile , the adorable hound is settling in well with her new owner , who is treating her like the high class character she is			0
' in just one day , she follows me like a shadow			0
she just wants love , and we love her , ' @entity32 said .			0

@entity5 was found wandering around @entity6 , @entity7 , two weeks ago when a good @entity8 took her to @entity9
there , vets discovered 80 - 100 bbs lodged in the dog 's face , back and legs
the dog *avoided* any eye or organ damage and because the bbs are brass she probably does n't need to get them removed
@entity18 and the @entity19 are trying to track down her attackers
