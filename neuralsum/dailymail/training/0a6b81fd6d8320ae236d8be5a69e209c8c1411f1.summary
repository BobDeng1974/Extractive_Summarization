@entity9 ( left ) has blamed doctors for her two - year - old son 's eating habits after he refuses to eat anything but biscuits			1
she says medics should do more to diagnose his condition rather than say he is ' fussy ' mrs @entity9 said : ' something needs to be done before we end up putting him in a coffin			1
he weighs less than a three - month - old baby			2
' ' half of the doctors in hospital had n't read all of his notes before they came to see us			2
the whole time we were in there , it felt like we were doing the same things as at home			0
' mrs @entity9 and her husband @entity47 claim to have tried everything to get him eating wholesome and nutritious food but he will only eat biscuits , including fig rolls and chocolate digestives			1
they are occasionally able to trick him into eating cookie cereal because he thinks he is eating mini biscuits			2
@entity13 is two - years - old but weights only 15lbs , which is the same as a three - month - old baby mrs @entity9 said : ' he will just play with food in his mouth and that 's it			1
i 'm at the end of my tether			0
i do n't know what to do			0
' maybe it 's an oral phobia			1
he never really put things in his mouth when he was baby , which was very unusual			0
' the doctors think it might be a behavioural problem but i do n't believe that because he 's been like this since he was born			1
' in his first month alive he lost a whole pound , it took us months to get his weight back up to what it had been when he was born			0
' the only variety he adds to the diet is that he some times has a mouthful of yoghurt or a nibble of a bacon flavour crisp			0
' it 's got to the point now where he just runs away crying from plates of food - people keep trying to force him to eat and it 's making the situation worse			2
' the mother - of - two said she was disappointed that doctors have done little more than suggest her son is just a fussy eater			1
she added that @entity13 's weight loss has led to his skin become stretchy , a pale complexion and he is now prone to becoming ill more easily			2
@entity13 was not born prematurely and although he was a light baby , weighing 5lbs 1oz , he was not critically under - weight			1
the couple , who have a healthy five - year - old daughter called @entity103 , are now considering the offer of sending him to a special pre-school in @entity106 which may help him			0
a spokesman for @entity108 , which runs @entity17 , said : ' we are committed to providing high quality and safe care for our patients and we take complaints seriously			0
' we are disappointed to hear that mrs @entity9 was unhappy and would like to continue to work with her to look into her concerns through our patient advice and @entity116 so we can answer any questions she may have about her son 's care			1
' former gp and patient advocate dr @entity120 said : ‘ if this little boy is really only eating biscuits i can certainly understand his parents ’ concern			2
mrs @entity9 , who has a healthy five - year - old daughter , sneaks high - fibre milkshake into @entity13 's hot chocolate ‘ presumably being the weight he is , the hospital will have followed up his stay and will be following his progress closely - at his weight they would not just let him go home and leave it there			1
‘ and presumably , after a stay of 10 days in hospital if they can find no medical problems i should imagine a specialist paediatrician will be closely watching his progress over the coming months and years			0
‘ what he is currently eating is clearly not a satisfactory diet			0
he ’s not getting everything he needs as he would if he were eating fruit and vegetables			0
‘ he ’s not getting enough vitamin c , or micro-nutrients like anti-oxidants and that sort of thing			0
‘ i can not believe that the hospital would not have assigned him a dietary nutritionist to work with his parents to advise them on how best to give him a balanced diet			0
‘ this boy ’s parents need to work with a nutritionist and specialist paediatrician and follow their advice to ensure their child receives a balanced diet			0
