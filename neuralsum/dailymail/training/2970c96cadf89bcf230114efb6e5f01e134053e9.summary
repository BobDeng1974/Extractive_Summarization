by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter published : 08:29 est , 14 october 2013 updated : 18:10 est , 14 october 2013 price prediction patriarch : @entity4 showed decades ago that stock prices are easier to predict years in advance than within a few days @entity7 @entity4 , @entity8 and @entity9 won the @entity10 for economics on monday for developing new methods to study trends in asset markets			1
the @entity15 said the three had laid the foundation of the current understanding of asset prices by developing a prediction model based on fluctuations in risk , risk attitudes and how they interact with behavioral biases and market friction			1
‘ the @entity29 have laid the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices , ’ the organization said in a statement announcing the winners			1
mr @entity4 ’s study of the financial markets began in the 1960s			0
he soon theorized that , while stock prices are hard to predict in the short - term , it is actually less difficult to predict long - term fluctuations			2
he also proved that ' value ' and small - cap stocks provide better returns than ' growth ' stocks , @entity37 noted			0
building on the revelations made by mr @entity4 , 74 , mr @entity43 proved that stock prices are much more volatile than dividends paid by a company since they tend to fall as the ratio between them grows			2
dividends are based mainly on a company ’s performance , but stock prices can be influenced by any number of factors , just one of which is performance			2
" these findings , which might seem surprising and contradictory , were made and analyzed by this year 's laureates , " the academy said			1
housing guru : @entity43 's work led to the creation of the @entity65 housing price index , as well as index funds mr @entity43 ’s 1980s proof of theory led to innovations such as index funds			1
similar to mutual funds , these investment vehicles have become popular alternatives to financial advisors for individual investors , @entity37 noted			0
his findings also apply to the bond markets			0
further proof of mr @entity43 ’s impact on the financial world are the @entity65 home price indexes created with @entity81			1
despite his revolutionary findings , mr @entity43 was in disbelief he won			0
' i did not expect it , ' he said via phone during a press conference announcing the winners , according to @entity37			0
proof of the last decade ’s housing bubble can be seen with home prices doubling in the years leading up to 2006 before cratering during the @entity91			2
the housing bubble : the @entity65 housing index shows the steep rise in home prices in the decade leading up to the @entity91 , and the subsequent nosedive starting in late 2006 building on the work of predecessors , and in compliment to the two men he shares this year ’s @entity10 with , mr @entity8 ’s research led to the rational investor theory			1
mr @entity8 set out to show how a rational investor might react when faced with long - term asset price uncertainty , and concluded that borrowing limits and risk restrictions prevent smart investors from trading in mispriced markets			2
the rational investor : @entity8 's rational investor theories led to the modern understanding of trading behavior and risk controls these findings have led to modern risk controls and long - term risk predictions			1
deviations from this theory are able to explain buying and selling in just about any market condition			0
mr @entity4 and mr @entity8 , 60 , are associated with the @entity122			0
mr @entity9 , 67 , is a professor at @entity123			0
@entity7 researchers have dominated the economics awards in recent years ; the last time there was no @entity7 among the winners was in 1999			1
the @entity10 committees have now announced all six of the annual $ 1.2 million awards for 2013			0
the economics award is not a @entity10 in the same sense as the medicine , chemistry , physics , literature and peace prizes , which were created by @entity139 industrialist @entity138 in 1895			1
the inventor of dynamite , mr @entity138 died only a year later			0
@entity139 's central bank added the economics prize in 1968 as a memorial to @entity10 .			2

the trio 's findings have laid the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices and behaviors
index funds and a home price index are among the innovations sprouting from their work
@entity7 have taken home at least a share of the economics award every year since 1999
