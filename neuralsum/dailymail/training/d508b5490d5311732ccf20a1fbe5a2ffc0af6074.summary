faith : dr @entity6 is the only dentist in the country to offer the ' pain - free ' treatment , which uses a combination of ingredients commonly found in toothpaste ' they have consumed a lot of acid in the diet which has weakened the enamel on the teeth			1

low price puts off dentists who can make £ 800 from *traditional* treatments
dr @entity6 *slams* dentists who *refuse* to perform treatment as ' stupid '
' they do n't have vision . they want to make money , they think this is too cheap '
