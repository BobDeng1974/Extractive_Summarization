by @entity0 two years ago , @entity1 was the man who defied his age to ensure his side progressed past @entity4 at @entity5 , his outrageous chipped penalty punctuating an immaculate display of passing and vision			1
to remain that cool and calm in the face of such intense pressure was incredible to witness , but many wondered just how long he would remain at the top of his game			0
the bad news for @entity4 – and indeed any side who face @entity16 this summer – is that there is still no sign of the 35 - year - old starting to wane			2
audacious : @entity1 scores for @entity16 past @entity21 at @entity5 with a ' @entity23 ' penalty catch him if you can : @entity1 leaves @entity25 ( left ) , @entity26 and @entity27 ( right ) in his wake with many players , the idea of them losing ‘ a yard of pace ’ as they enter the autumn of their career is a genuine concern , but even the most ardent fan would struggle to remember @entity1 ever sprinting			2
however , while it will surprise no one to learn that his 131 passes were more than all four @entity4 midfielder ’s combined in that @entity5 quarter final , the fact that he also covered more distance – a staggering 11.58km in a single game – is an eye - opening statistic			1
he plays the game in the same calm , calculated manner he approached that spot - kick against @entity21 , never hurried and always able to find time and space to deliver an incisive pass			0
it is incredible to think that he has been a part of the last four title winning sides in @entity62 , enjoying an undefeated season with @entity64 in 2011 - 12 before helping them net a record 102 points this term			0
men in black : @entity1 and @entity16 coach @entity69 arrive in @entity70 on friday the man @entity71 this week called ' the world ’s greatest playmaker , ' had another superb campaign , completing 88.5 per cent of his passes but there is so much more to his game than his ability to consistently find a team - mate with the ball			1
' he ’s one of those players who allows you to dream , ' @entity81 told reporters after watching his team - mate curl home a last - minute free kick to win a match against @entity88 recently			0
that narrow 1 - 0 victory was viewed as the tipping point in this year ’s title race in @entity16 , yet another punctuated by the greatness of the man in the @entity64 no. 21 shirt			0
it was his fourth goal of the season as he headed towards his final tally of six , and all of them came from set - pieces around the edge of the area , highlighting yet another facet to his game that opponents would do well to heed			0
in that same interview , former @entity105 midfielder @entity71 went on to say that @entity4 ' can not repeat the mistakes of @entity5			1
' @entity109 maestro : @entity1 is still @entity16 's main man even though he is 35 - years - old @entity110 : @entity1 celebrates scoring for @entity64 against @entity111 in the @entity112 in april those errors appear to be commonplace outside of @entity16 , where people seem less aware of @entity1 ’s all - round excellence			2
of the @entity4 squad headed to @entity117 , only @entity26 ( 98 ) and @entity118 ( 83 ) recorded more tackles ( 43 ) than the bearded @entity120 in 2013 - 14 , while only the @entity123 skipper ’s tally of 48 interceptions were higher than @entity1 ’s 39			1
he may well be two years older than the last time he put @entity4 to the sword , but @entity1 continues to be the metronomic beating heart of @entity16 ’s midfield .			1

@entity120 midfielder still going strong at the age of 35
@entity1 put on midfield *masterclass* against @entity4 at @entity5
@entity71 *hailed* him as ' the world 's greatest playmaker '
