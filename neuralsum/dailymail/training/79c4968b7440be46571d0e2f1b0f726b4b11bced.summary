@entity7 , 65 , was told that @entity9 , his wife of 35 years , had contracted meningitis from tainted steroid injections intended to treat her back pain			1
and mr @entity7 's own back injections may have come from a contaminated batch too - meaning that when he laid his wife to rest today he still did not know if he too was suffering from the deadly illness			1
her husband went to an emergency room last weekend for a spinal tap , but the test results had not arrived by the time of @entity9 's memorial service in @entity39 , @entity25 on tuesday			1
' they advised me to watch for symptoms , ' mr @entity7 said			1

in the country as a whole , 119 cases of the illness have so far been linked to the injections , according to the @entity68			1
meningitis is an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord , and a back injection would put any contaminant in more direct contact with that lining			1
mrs @entity20 died on september 30 , aged 67			2
she had been ill since late august , but it was not diagnosed as meningitis until september 22			2
nonetheless , her health seemed to be improving at @entity82 hospital			2

her fever was broken , ' mr @entity7 said			0
' she was walking the hallway and skyping with grandsons			0
' but she became unresponsive on september 26 , and was eventually removed from life support after suffering a stroke			0
mr @entity7 said he was informed on saturday that his wife had been treated with tainted steroids for back pain			1
the doctor at @entity98 said mr @entity7 also was at risk			0
' the whole staff is devastated , ' said mr @entity7			0
' the people there are professionals			0
i have the greatest respect for their care			0
they truly care about the people they treat			0
they 're suffering just as much as i am			0
