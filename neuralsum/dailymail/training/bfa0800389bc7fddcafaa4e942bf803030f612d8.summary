by @entity0 published : 21:03 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 03:31 est , 22 january 2013 ministers should stop promising that controversial road - building and high speed rail schemes will give economic boosts to @entity2 unless they can present real ‘ evidence ’ to back up their claims , the @entity2 ’s top transport planners said today			1
slashing journey times on the @entity11 rail system and getting the private sector to build more road tolls will not necessarily boost the @entity2 economy on the scale ministers were pledging , they say			2
and they criticised the @entity17 for ‘ ducking the issue ’ of how improvements to the transport system should be paid for – especially the idea of controversial ‘ pay - as - you - drive ’ road pricing			1
slashing journey times on the @entity11 rail system and getting the private sector to build more road tolls will not necessarily boost the @entity2 economy on the scale ministers were pledging , it has been claimed the broadside came in a letter to transport secretary @entity30 from 32 leading professors of transport and the two major professional bodies which together represent more than 3,000 @entity2 transport planners			1
the letter to the transport secretary signed by the 32 top academics says : ’ operating within significant fiscal constraint , the @entity35 is seeking to stimulate economic recovery , tackle climate change and improve the well - being of the population			2
’ but it added : ’ however , we are concerned that a perception of the economic imperative is leading to a series of important decisions on all of the major transport modes being taken in the absence of a coherent and integrated national policy framework			2
’ while ministers push transport investment as a way of stimulating economic growth , the professors insist : ‘ the evidence base is not as strong as you , or we , might wish			1
’ on road building they note : ’ our cities are simply not equipped to take further growth in road traffic and the benefits of faster journey times on the strategic network risk being lost in the greater congestion on local urban roads where the majority of journeys are undertaken			0
’ ’ the broadside came in a letter to transport secretary @entity30 from 32 leading professors of transport the letter carries the support of the @entity78 and the @entity79 which together cover the majority of the @entity2 ’s 3,000 town planners			1
@entity82 , chairman of the @entity78 ( @entity83 ) , under whose umbrella the letter was sent cited the controversial @entity11 high speed line from @entity87 to the @entity88 and the @entity89 said ministers had promised economic benefits – from faster journey times to greater investment in business – he said : ’ the jury is still out on @entity11			0
on building more roads he added : ’ we do not want to see the @entity2 slipping back into the dead end of trying to build our way out of congestion			0
‘ ministers have to do their proper homework			0
the government ’s sums need to be tested more rigorously			0
’ and on funding such projects it notes : ’ no progress has been made in the debate on how we should pay for improvements to the transport system			1
‘ understandably perhaps , your predecessors and the @entity17 have ducked the issue			2
’ the planners say they support controversial pay - as - you drive road pricing but accept there is little or no public support , even though revenues from road tax are set to fall considerably as cars become cleaner : ’ there is a need to find a new way of charging for motoring			0
’ the letter echoes a similar one sent in 2002 to then @entity131 transport secretary @entity130 in which transport planners and academics warned ministers of their ‘ unrealistic expectations ’ .			0

32 leading professors said the @entity17 was ducking the issue of how improvements to the transport system should be paid for
professors insist there no strong evidence the schemes will provide economic boost to @entity2
