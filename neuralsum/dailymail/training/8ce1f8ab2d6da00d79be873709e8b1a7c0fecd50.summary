the five - year - old 's father @entity6 admitted that his unwell son ' will be scared ' but his mother @entity8 will be there to hold his hand and both have ' every confidence ' @entity13 doctors will cure him			1

it is incredible , i have every confidence in it			0
' it is daunting and @entity1 will be scared but his mother will be holding his hand			2
' with his devoted parents by his side , @entity1 finally arrived at hospital in the @entity13 yesterday – as his father declared : ‘ it ’s all worthwhile – he will get better			1
’ just days ago , his parents were in a @entity16 prison cell after being arrested for removing the youngster from an @entity50 hospital in @entity51 without doctors ’ permission and taking him abroad			1
but following a public outcry , the couple were released and reunited with their son , before being allowed to transfer him to @entity5 for the proton beam therapy treatment they desperately want for him			1
in a statement , the @entity4 said : ' if all goes well and the physicists will be able to prepare @entity1 's irradiation plan in four days already instead of standard 10 days , he will start the first irradiation on monday ' his plan takes 30 irradiation visits and is combined with chemotherapy			2
' the chemotherapy will be applied by specialised oncologists at @entity69 , where @entity1 is hospitalised with his mother			2
' fresh start : @entity1 arrived at @entity5 's @entity4 this morning for tests before treatment his parents have ' every confidence ' will cure his brain cancer family : the unwell five - year - old was again with his parents @entity6 and @entity8 as he was wheeled into the clinic love : @entity26 gives his son a kiss ahead of crucial tests to determine what care he can receive as @entity1 was stretchered from the ambulance yesterday , his father @entity6 , 51 , said : ‘ it ’s amazing , i ’m excited			1
‘ when you see my son you see why the whole thing we ’ve been through has been worthwhile to get him better			0
’ @entity1 ’s mother @entity8 , 45 , added : ‘ i ’m so happy to be here			2
’ their emotional arrival came as it emerged @entity1 ’s treatment is expected to cost up to £ 70,000 – and could be paid for by the @entity50			1
@entity97 of the @entity69 – where @entity1 will stay while he is treated at the @entity4 – said it was a ‘ good question ’ who would foot the bill			2

either the parents will pay , or the @entity50 will pay under new @entity119 regulations or the parents will pay and then take the bill to the @entity50 for reimbursement			0
’ the @entity50 funds proton beam therapy abroad ‘ whenever it is considered clinically appropriate ’			0
however , @entity124 does not fund proton therapy for medulloblastoma – the cancer that @entity1 has – because of concern that patients not fit enough to travel would be delayed from receiving radiotherapy and subsequently have a reduced chance of a cure			2
last year 99 children were fully funded by the @entity50 to go abroad for proton beam therapy			0
one method of funding is the @entity137 , an arrangement between the @entity50 and the state healthcare provider in the @entity119 country patients are visiting , which requires prior approval			0
