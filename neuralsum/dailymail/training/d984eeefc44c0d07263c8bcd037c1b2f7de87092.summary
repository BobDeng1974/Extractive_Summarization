mrs @entity34 , a freelance social worker , told the hearing in @entity61 that they were pursuing legal action against the riding establishment			1
she said that the three children and her husband were all riding as she watched			1
but she continued : ' @entity25 was kicked while he was still on the horse			2
i did n't actually see him come off but i 'm pretty certain he was kicked as he was hanging			0
he had started to slide off			0
it was the back foot of the horse [ which struck him ]			0
the horse was determined to get him off			0
' she added that she also felt @entity25 's helmet might have been too loose			0
@entity9 died in an accident near @entity22 ' i 'm not a horse rider			0
nobody helped us check the helmets			0
it was a bit looser than i would have liked but it was the third one he tried on and we ended up doing it ourselves without any advice , ' she said			0
' i feel as if the riding establishment was negligent in teaching children who were first time riders , which he was			1

it 's more dangerous than motorcycling			0
