victim : mr @entity2 was executed by @entity14 militants in august a video that was shared on social media by contrast , @entity42 governments do pay ransoms and as a result their hostages are more often returned home safely , a practice @entity5 feels encourages kidnapping			1

in exchange for his assistance he wanted $ 750,000 and asylum in the @entity5			1
according to the @entity12 , the general sent an aide with this information to the @entity76 in the @entity16 capital , @entity78 , but he was rebuffed			1
the general said : ' they did n’t even want to hear the details ; they rejected the proposal outright			0
the @entity5 just keep on saying , " we do n’t negotiate with terrorists			2
" ' the @entity12 also reported on a separate missed opportunity to free mr @entity2 a few months later			2
after the failed @entity5 raid to free the hostages in july , @entity14 sent an envoy called @entity89 to the @entity16 city of @entity91 where he met a @entity5 intelligence official they knew as @entity94			2
a fighter who accompanied the @entity89 said : ' i met @entity94 , and he came out , but he refused to meet @entity89			0
' i told him : " the sheikh is here to negotiate			0
" @entity94 blamed me and said : " we do n’t meet with terrorists			0

" hostage : mr @entity2 ( seen in 2011 ) is thought to have been kidnapped near the town of @entity51 in northern @entity52 on @entity53 in 2012 mr @entity2 ’s parents have openly called into question the @entity5 government ’s policy of not negotiating with terrorists , which was brought in by @entity111 in 2002 in the wake of 9/11			1

' i pray that our government would be willing to learn from the mistakes that were made and to acknowledge that there are better ways for @entity5 citizens to be treated			0
' among the other missteps the @entity5 government made was failing to interview other hostages held with mr @entity2 who had been freed and could have provided intelligence as to their whereabouts			1

he demanded $ 100,000 before talks went any further - the @entity12 reported that they would have sought a total of $ 20 million			0
the @entity144 said that without proof of life they would not pay anything because it would involve mortgaging their house , words which enraged the sheikh			0
he told the family friend : ' tell the family they will see their proof of life on tv			0
