by @entity0 published : 13:01 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 13:50 est , 3 june 2013 the @entity2 may have the reputation for being expert wine makers , but they learnt everything they know from the @entity8 , new research suggests			1
chemical analysis of two large - handled pots used to transport produce around 2,400 years ago , found on the site of ancient @entity2 port @entity12 by researchers from @entity15 , show they were imported from an old civilisation north of @entity18			1
the pots - also known as amphoras - are the earliest evidence of wine - making in @entity2 and suggest that the @entity2 relied on @entity24 merchants from @entity8 to deliver the first batches of wine before making their own			1
an ancient wine pressing platform found on the site of ancient @entity2 port @entity12			1
the discovery was made by researchers from @entity15 and is the earliest known evidence of the @entity2 wine - making industry			2
the spout of the press was used for drawing off the wine and the press was raised off the courtyard floor by four stones			0
masses of grape remains were also found nearby scans also showed a limestone platform that was later used as a wine press for crushing transplanted , domesticated grapes - the first time wine - making is known to have been carried out on @entity2 soil			2
the findings suggest the wine - making industry in @entity2 was fuelled by imported wine from the @entity50 region of @entity8 as early as 525 bc. the @entity51 were then lured into the @entity53 ' wine culture ' and began making their own as early as 425 @entity54 , reports @entity55			1
@entity2 wine making and the country 's association with fine wine have long held global fascination , but little is known about how and when the domesticated @entity62 grape and wine - making arrived in @entity2			2
dr @entity64 said : ' @entity2 's rise to world prominence in the wine culture has been well documented , especially since the 12th century , when the @entity69 monks determined by trial - and - error that @entity71 and @entity72 were the best cultivars to grow in @entity74			2
' what we have n't had is clear chemical evidence - combined with botanical and archaeological data - showing how wine was introduced into @entity2 and initiated a native industry			0
these are remains of the foundations of the @entity24 merchants ' quarters in @entity85 of @entity12			2
they date back to 525 - 474 ad			0
the amphoras , or large handed pots , shown in the top right - hand corner , were imported from @entity8 and are some of the earliest evidence of @entity2 wine making			1
' now we know the ancient @entity24 lured the @entity51 into the @entity53 wine culture by importing wine into southern @entity2			1
' this built up a demand that could only be met by establishing a native industry - likely done by transplanting the domesticated vine from @entity8 - and enlisting the requisite wine - making expertise from the @entity24			2
' masses of domesticated grape seeds , stems and grape skins found near the press which had a spout for running off the wine and was raised on four stones reveal the inhabitants were eventually producing their own			0
two large handled pots were found at the site of the ancient @entity2 port of @entity111			1
chemical analysis revealed they were imported from a civilisation north of @entity18 about 2,400 years ago			1
they are the earliest evidence of wine - making in @entity2 suggesting that the @entity2 relied on @entity8 merchants to deliver wine from @entity8 before they started making their own			1
the findings suggest the wine - making industry in @entity2 was fuelled by imported wine from the @entity50 region of @entity8 as early as 525 bc. the @entity51 were then lured into the @entity53 ' wine culture ' and began making their own as early as 425 bc. the researchers also found evidence of herbal and pine resin additives - revealing a medicinal role for wine			1
dr @entity64 said his study is a key step in understanding the ongoing development of the ' wine culture ' of the world that began in the @entity137 or @entity138 about 9,000 years ago			1
at the archaeological site of merchant quarters inside the walled settlement of @entity12 were numerous @entity24 amphoras dating back to between 525 and 475 bc. there were selected for analysis because they were whole , unwashed , found in an undisturbed , sealed context and showed signs of residue on their interior bases where solid compounds of the wine collected			2
judging by their shape and other features the transportation vessels were of a specific @entity24 type and probably manufactured at the city of @entity158 - or modern @entity157 - in central @entity8 during the same time period			0
state - of - the - art microscopes found all the samples were positive for tartaric acid - the chemical fingerprint of the @entity62 grape and wine in the @entity166 and @entity53 - as well as compounds deriving from pine tree resin			0
herbal additives including rosemary , basil or thyme or both - which are native to central @entity8 where the wine was likely made - were also identified			0
alcoholic beverages - in which resinous and herbal compounds are more easily put into solution - were the principle medications of the ancient world			0
traces of herbal additives including rosemary ( left ) and basil ( right ) were found on the pots discovered on the site of ancient @entity2 port @entity12			1
these herbs are native to central @entity8 where the wine in the pots was likely made before being transported to @entity2 nearby the pressing platform dated to about 425 @entity54 was discovered			1
its function had previously been uncertain			0
tartaric acid was detected in the limestone demonstrating that the installation was indeed a winepress			0
masses of several thousand domesticated grape seeds , stems and even skin dug up nearby further attest to its use for crushing transplanted , domesticated grapes and local wine production			0
dr @entity64 , who has been investigating the birth of wine for two decades , observes a common pattern for the spreading of the new culture			0
he said : ' first entice the rulers who could afford to import and ostentatiously consume wine			0
next , foreign specialists are commissioned to transplant vines and establish local industries			0
' over time , wine spreads to the larger population , and is integrated into social and religious life			0

pots found on site of ancient @entity2 port were probably imported from @entity8
scientists from @entity15 claim that @entity24 merchants delivered the first batches of wine to @entity2 more than 2,400 years ago
the @entity51 were then lured into the @entity53 ' wine culture ' and began making their own as early as 425 @entity54
