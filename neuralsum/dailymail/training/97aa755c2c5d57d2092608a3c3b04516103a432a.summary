by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:17 am on 2nd july 2011 oh , the pain			2
after all the waiting , the excitement and anticipation , @entity4 ’s name stays off the @entity9 champions ’ board for another year			1
the prospect of seeing a @entity11 in the final for the first time in 73 years – and maybe even its first champion since 1936 – was snatched away by the mighty @entity16 @entity15 in the semi-final for the second year in a row			1
the 24 - year - old @entity19 finished close to tears after winning the first set , then being overwhelmed by @entity15 ’s power			1
going out : @entity4 's initial confidence in the match turns to misery down and out : @entity4 shows his frustration on his way to a four - set defeat at the hands of @entity15 depressing scenes : fans watch @entity4 slip away with barely a whimper as @entity15 ends his resistance number one : @entity15 's progress to the final is assured after a commanding performance on @entity38 in the dumps : the faces of @entity4 's mother @entity41 and girlfriend @entity42 reflect his woes but he can still hold his head high as the best @entity46 player in decades – and the way his game has improved , he will have many more chances of @entity52 glory			1
asked if he had cried , @entity4 , who also lost in the semis two years ago , to @entity54 , replied : ‘ not today			1
’ what was it like to get this far and lose ? ‘ it ’s tough , ’ he said			2
‘ but i ’m giving it my best shot each time and i ’m trying my hardest – that ’s all you can do			0
’ of @entity15 , he said : ‘ he ’s one of the best players ever , and a great athlete on top of that			1
’ gracious : the @entity19 congratulates @entity15 on his triumph see you next year : @entity4 salutes the crowd at @entity9 as he bows out @entity15 told the @entity71 : ‘ seriously , i feel sad for @entity4			1
against him i have to play my best to have any chance and that ’s what i had to do today			0
’ asked what @entity4 needs to do to win a major , he said : ‘ i think he ’s playing well enough , probably a little more luck			1
’ the 25 - year - old reigning champion destroyed @entity4 ’s new - found confidence , returning some seemingly impossible balls to earn a final clash with @entity81			1
@entity82 : @entity4 's mother @entity41 and his girlfriend @entity42 arrive on @entity38 for his semi-final match , while former athlete @entity86 enjoys the action beautiful day : stunning @entity88 enjoys the tense semi-final @entity15 's ladies : mother of @entity15 , @entity92 , left , his girlfriend @entity93 , centre , and his sister @entity95 during the semi final match @entity15 turned the clock back to reveal flashes of the swearing , uncontrolled , cap - throwing @entity4 which had rarely been seen this year			1
@entity4 ’s defeat wiped out all that talk of comparison to @entity104 , the last @entity11 to win the title in 1936 , and @entity106 , the last to get to the final two years later			2
naturally the women in his life – mother @entity41 and girlfriend @entity42 – saw every second of it from the players ’ box			0
celebrity fans : @entity116 and boyfriend @entity117 enjoy the action fans were in confident mood ahead of @entity4 's semi-final with @entity15 not alone : fans of the @entity124 sensation also flocked to @entity9 to support their idol their faces became the barometer for @entity4 ’s progress , then the lack of it			1
@entity41 clapped with hands aloft and shouted : ‘ you can do it ! ’ to gee him up ; leapt to her feet to share moments of triumph ; then became increasingly grim - faced			2
@entity42 sat in silent synchronisation alongside her and spent a great deal of time nervously tossing her hair			0
whatever happens in the future , the cliffhanger match they witnessed will be remembered as the day @entity4 looked as if he might do it			1
but even with the nation ’s hopes pinned on him , the prospect apparently was n’t worthy of filling the @entity146 throughout			0
fifty of the 75 seats remained empty for the first three games , with the royals represented by the @entity150 and his daughter @entity151			0
@entity88 parked her celebrated derriere in the stalls			0
nor was it an occasion for which @entity4 felt the need to be clean - shaven			1
the straggly facial fluff he has sported for the entire tournament was still in evidence			0
fans hoping to watch the semi-finals from @entity162 are escorted into the grounds @entity81 celebrates his victory over @entity165 in this afternoon 's first semi-final no man standing : djokovic and @entity165 both end up flat on the floor after one rally hundreds of fans had camped out all night for the chance to be here on a day when tennis glory could have been in the offing			1
four thousand backsides eventually bagged places on the hillside renamed @entity162 in his honour			0
another 4,000 fans watched on a separate screen inside @entity184			0
the grass slope was dotted with @entity186 , @entity187 and occasional flashes of @entity124 national colours			0
@entity190 ( where @entity4 lives , remember ) does have a county flag but curiously , none was visible			2
@entity194 , who plays in the women 's final tomorrow , was out on the practise courts this morning the @entity150 arrives with princess @entity151 in the @entity146 on @entity38 @entity197 and tv presenter @entity198 were in the crowd on @entity38 for the men 's semi-finals @entity202 , 17 , from @entity203 , stormed into today 's boys ' final by beating the former world junior number one , @entity208 @entity207 @entity9 eventually could have a second court with a retractable roof			2
having wrapped up a 15 - year renovation project , the @entity211 is contemplating future work , and one possible change being considered is adding a cover for @entity216			2
@entity38 has had a roof since the 2009 tournament			0
@entity9 spokesman @entity219 says that ' everything is up for discussion ' and adds that ' a @entity216 1 roof ca n't be ruled in , but could n't be ruled out '			0
there are two retractable roofs at the @entity225 , and the @entity226 says it will have a retractable roof on its main stadium by 2016			0
the @entity229 says it does not plan to put a roof on @entity231 , the top court for the @entity233 .			0

@entity46 number one takes *thrilling* first first set 7 - 5
but @entity15 fights back with second and third and fourth set wins
@entity81 destroys @entity165
@entity4 vows to try harder in future and be ' more professional '
