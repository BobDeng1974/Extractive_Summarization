by @entity1 reporter published : 16:18 est , 12 november 2013 updated : 17:58 est , 12 november 2013 a unique project to unveil the workings of the brains of a woolly mammoth is underway in @entity6 following the discovery of a near perfect specimen			1
the 10 - year - old animal which scientists have named @entity11 was found superbly preserved in the @entity13 permafrost in 2009			1
despite being dead for around 39,000 years @entity11 's brain was in such good condition that scientists are only recently have researchers disclosed that a full - scale brain mapping exercise is now underway			1
delicate work : a team of scientists carefully remove the brain from the skull huge interest : researchers hope they will be able to significantly boost out knowledge of how the woolly mammoths lived vital statistics : a scientist measures the base of @entity11 the mammoth 's skull scientists hope that by quite literally getting inside the beast 's head they will be able to significantly boost our understanding of the woolly mammoth			1
remarkable pictures published in the @entity40 show the moment scientist carefully removed the brain from @entity11 's remains so the analysis could begin			2
their initial findings were presented at the 73rd symposium of the @entity48 in @entity49			0
they claim that the real breakthrough that came when the first @entity52 of the cranium was performed at the @entity54 , @entity55 in may 2012			0
the team at @entity55 said : ' it unexpectedly revealed the preserved brain with well - defined major gross anatomy features , including frontal , temporal , and parietal lobes with gyri , and cerebellum with internal structures , which yielded the first chance to examine woolly mammoth brain morphology			1
' the brain extraction was performed based on our own experience combined with the generally used treatment for large mammals , including modern elephants			2
in tact : @entity11 's brain is one of the best - preserved mammoth brains ever discovered as many previous examples have been damaged or shriveled up over the years preservation : after removing it from the skull the brain is now stored in formalin solution in @entity81 ' in february 2013 , the brain was preserved by the method of flowing fixation developed by professor @entity85 ( @entity86 , @entity87 ( @entity86 , @entity87 ) in @entity81 ) , which included three weeks of continuous preservation of the braincase content only using formalin			1
' ' after the extraction , the brain was wrapped with fabric for support and placed into formalin solution overnight before being flown to @entity81			0
it is currently stored in formalin solution at the @entity86 '			0
early research results confirm the mammoth has a similar brain structure to that of the modern elephant but the team are keen to point out that more research is needed			2
crucially the scientist have been able to identify the main functional areas of the brain and so are able to look forward to a point where they can create a ' brain atlas ' for the animal			0
on tour : @entity11 's body is now doing a tour of the world 's top museums where the public has been flocking to see her future : scientists are now hopeful they will be able to create ' brain atlas ' for the woolly mammoth this is to take place in @entity81 at the @entity86 under the guidance of professor @entity85			1
a report by professor @entity127 and colleagues explained the significance of the new project which he says will help us ' to understand particular aspects of their behaviour '			0
it says : ' this discovery holds great scientific significance			0
this is the first time scientists have got their hands on the brain of an animal that lived tens of thousands of years ago , and one that is in such good condition			0
' but while @entity11 's brains are being keenly examined by scientists her body is proving to be equally anticipated by tourists who flock to see her as she continues a tour of the world 's top museums which this week takes her to @entity154 .			2

the remains of 10 - year - old @entity11 were discovered in @entity13 in 2009 and offers one the most complete example of a woolly mammoth brain ever found
researchers are now carrying out a full - scale mapping exercise in *bid* to significantly boost our knowledge about the *mysterious* species
