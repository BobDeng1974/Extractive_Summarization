mothers with 19 children between them who receive tens of thousands in handouts every year claim they are stuck on benefits and are forced to live off the state because they would be worse off if they went back to work			1
the women claim they have been told by @entity9 there are no options for them because the cost of childcare for their many offspring would not be met by their wages			1
they live in privately rented homes which they are unable to pay for themselves and say they can not get on council housing lists because they have too many children or face waiting lists running into years			2
@entity24 has seven children and receives benefits of around £ 35,000 a year but said she is stuck on benefits and believes the government needs to pursue absent fathers rather than penalise single parents and think they enjoy living off the state			1
she said : ' where can i get a job that earns me more than that ? ' her six bedroom house in @entity52 is paid for almost entirely by benefits and she has not worked in 20 years			1
ms @entity24 said anyone who believes living on benefits is easy is ' wrong			1
' she said : ' the hardest thing is being able to provide for my kids			2
i ca n't go out and earn that money			0
' the fathers do n't provide for their own kids			1
it 's about time the government cracked down on parents like that			1
it 's all very well pointing a finger at single parents , but what about absent parents ? ' struggling with bringing up and providing for seven growing children on her own , the 40 - year - old admitted she owes about £ 12,000 in gas and electric bills , which she has avoided paying in various homes she has lived in			1
she is trying to get a debt release order to cover the cost , but she admitted ' otherwise i will keep avoiding it			2
' @entity80 is a mother of seven and claims the job centre told her it was impossible for her to get a job ms @entity80 said her partner @entity84 , who is also on benefits for his health problems , is the bigger burden ms @entity24 lives in a three - storey home which costs £ 725 a month in rent , which is paid for almost entirely by housing benefits			1
she complains about broken parts of the house - including a leaking shower , kitchen cupboards that are too small and half the power sockets not working			2

asking them not to judge him , he says : ‘ it ’s taken a long time to collect all this nice stuff			0
’ mr @entity84 has not worked for ten years and spends his days playing poker in the hope he will win ' millions ' ms @entity80 , 36 , said surviving on benefits is a struggle but it would be impossible for her to go out to work in one scene , the house runs out of electricity , leaving the eldest sons distraught that their xboxes do not work			1
in spite of these struggles , ms @entity80 - who has not worked in 12 years - still does not want help to find work			1
she was asked to go to the @entity9 about finding work but said they could do nothing to help her and branded the experience a ' waste of time '			0
even before going , she said : ‘ i do n’t know what they are going to do			0
' they are going to look into getting me back into work , which is absolutely impossible because i ’ve got people to look after			2
’ after the meeting , she said : ' they told me " you wo n't get working tax credits , you wo n't get child care			0
we wo n't bother doing a job search , there 's nothing here for you			0

of her husband , ms @entity209 said : ' if he was a horse he would be shot			0
