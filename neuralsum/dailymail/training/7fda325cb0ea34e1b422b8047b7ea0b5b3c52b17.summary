by @entity0 published : 07:35 est , 13 august 2012 updated : 08:23 est , 13 august 2012 police stopped nearly 700,000 people on the streets of @entity4 last year , compared to 90,000 in the aftermath of 9/11			2
nearly 87 per cent were of black or @entity7 ethnicity			2
of these , half were frisked and ten per cent were arrested			0
under fire : @entity11 officers were left in a stand - off with a machete - wielding man after they stopped him in @entity14 on saturday the figures come in the wake of a terrifying stand - off in @entity14 at the weekend , in which a machete - wielding knifeman repeatedly lunged at @entity11 ( @entity11 ) officers before being fatally shot in front of shocked tourists			1
@entity23 , a 51 - year - old black man who appeared to be smoking marijuana , had become agitated on saturday afternoon when officers approached him near @entity26 and @entity27 , one of the city 's busiest tourist destinations			1
critics of the stop - and - frisk policy claim officers use racial profiling and have unfairly stopped a number of people			1
@entity37 district judge @entity36 said there was ' overwhelming evidence ' that police have conducted thousands of unlawful stops based on flimsy justification such as ' furtive movement '			0
she berated the @entity11 for displaying ' a deeply troubling apathy toward @entity4 ' most fundamental constitutional rights '			0
in january , @entity47 teenager @entity46 , 19 , was brutally beaten by police officers in what his attorney called ' a stop - and - frisk gone terribly wrong '			1
officers alleged he was carrying plastic bags with drugs , but video footage showed mr @entity46 moments before his encounter with the police , walking down the street with his hands out by his sides			0
mr @entity46 was stopped on january 26 by officers and thrown to the ground , handcuffed and taken away , before being charged with a variety of crimes			0
all charges have since been dropped by the @entity47 district attorney , @entity67			0
under arrest : mr @entity46 , right , was stopped by police because they claimed he had drugs in his hands in may , a judge granted class - action status to a lawsuit brought by the @entity74 on behalf of four black men , meaning thousands of others who have been stopped over the years could potentially add their names to the complaint			2
the @entity79 also rolled out a stop and @entity82 smartphone app in june that allows bystanders to record police stops and instantly alert others to where it is taking place			1
police commissioner @entity89 has since announced changes to officer training and supervision , and the number of stops has since declined dramatically			2
keeping watch : @entity79 have released an app , stop and @entity97 , to keep people informed of where police searches are being carried out but the commissioner and mayor @entity101 fiercely defend the aggressive policing and credit it with transforming @entity4 into one of the safest big cities in the @entity37			1
they say the stop - and - frisk programme has helped prevent thousands of deaths by taking guns off the street and deny allegations of racial profiling , saying more blacks and @entity116 are stopped because many minority neighbourhoods have the highest crime rates			1
mr @entity101 said : ' nobody should ask @entity120 to apologise - he 's not going to and neither am i. ' and i think it 's fair to say that stop , question and frisk has been an essential part of the @entity11 's work			1
' other cities have adopted policies similar to @entity4 's , provoking the same debate			0
last year , officials in @entity133 placed its ' stop and frisk ' programme under court supervision to settle a federal lawsuit alleging racial profiling			1
@entity140 mayor @entity139 faced a backlash when he raised the possibility of adopting ' stop and frisk ' to get guns off the streets			2
mr @entity139 announced last tuesday that he was no longer considering it			0
in @entity4 , the police department , whose officers were hailed as heroes in the aftermath of the september 11 , 2001 attacks , has seen its approval ratings soar as homicide rates plummet , from a high of 2,245 killings in 1990 to 515 last year			0
a poll in march found that 63 per cent of @entity4 voters approve of how the country 's largest police force is doing its job			1
but @entity4 are divided about ' stop and frisk '			0
art of the matter : a woman walks past a street mural in @entity4 with her children which depicts a person 's rights during a stop and frisk while 49 per cent of voters disapproved of the policy , only four per cent approved			2
the poll also revealed deep splits along racial lines			0
while nearly 60 per cent of white voters were in favour of the tactic , 68 per cent of black people were opposed			0
according to the @entity79 , 168,126 black males between the ages of 14 and 24 were stopped - more than the 158,406 people who are in that group			2
the ' stop - and - frisk ' policy dates back to the 1990s when mayor @entity185 adopted a ' zero tolerance ' approach to policing			1
mayor @entity189 claimed that cracking down on minor offences would help reduce serious crime			0
pressure has now been building in the city against the practice			0
thousands of @entity4 took part in a silent march against the policy , while a @entity199 editorial called on the @entity101 administration to stop fighting the lawsuit and ' reform its abusive stop - and - frisk ' policy			1
essential : mayor @entity101 has defended the stop and frisk programme on alert : police stopped and searched more people in @entity4 last year than in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001			1

*majority* of people stopped are black or @entity7
figures released in wake of fatal stand - off between @entity11 officers and machete - wielding man
critics claim policy uses racial profiling and number of people have been unfairly stopped
@entity79 has rolled out a stop and @entity229 app to alert people to where police stops are taking place
mayor @entity101 claims policy is ' essential ' to @entity11 's work
most voters approve of city 's police force but are divided over stop - and - frisk programme
