by @entity0 for @entity1 a horrified shopper has told how she found two false widow spiders in a bunch of red grapes from a co-op supermarket			1
@entity7 , 28 , was puzzled to see ' dust and cobwebs ' when she opened the bag for lunch at her office in @entity13 before spotting the live venomous arachnid			1
luckily for ms @entity7 , experts believe the spider was a male - and it is female false widows whose bites have made headlines			1
creepy - crawlies : shopper @entity22 found this spider - believed to be a false widow , @entity25 's most venomous - in a bag of red grapes which she had bought for lunch from a co-op branch in @entity13 but she complained to the store 's customer service department - and then found a second identical spider lying dead at the bottom of the bag			1
ms @entity7 said she jumped in shock when she noticed the first spider , drawing the attention of colleagues who took photos of it			1
' we were n't sure at first if it was a false widow spider , ' she said			2
' but my colleagues looked at the markings on its back and after looking online identified it as a false widow spider			2
' after that no one wanted to go near the grapes			1
' a @entity53 spokesman confirmed the spider ' certainly looks like a false widow spider '			2
scene : the grapes were bought from a co-op branch in @entity13 ( pictured )			1
the firm has apologised they 've inspired terror into millions , sparking complaints that their danger has been over-hyped			1
so what are false widow spiders ? much of their reputation is thought to be thanks to the black widow , which although similarly named is far more dangerous and has been known to kill children , ill or elderly people			2
although its bites can be intensely uncomfortable - swelling hugely when infected - the false widow ( above ) is not known to have caused any deaths in @entity25			1
by comparison , around four @entity25 each year are though to die from bee or wasp stings when they have an allergic reaction			2
false widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny , black flesh , bulbous bodies , thick legs and skull - like patterns			2
millions of false widows , @entity25 's most venomous spider , are found across the @entity25 and the population is growing			0
also known by its @entity92 name @entity91 , its first @entity25 sighting was in @entity93 , @entity94 , in 1879 and is thought to have remained largely in southern @entity95			0
but the @entity96 says warmer summers mean the spider is spreading north , a theory backed by wildlife sightings			0
however , the spokesman added it looked like a male , saying : ' only the females have been known to bite on rare occasions '			0
ms @entity7 sent the picture to the co-op and was put in touch with the customer service department			1
' i was told to go back to the bag of grapes and get the barcode number so they could track it , ' she said			1
' they believed it came from @entity117 '			1
a spokesman for the @entity119 said : ' we are committed to working closely with farmers and suppliers in order to provide a consistently great shopping experience for our customers			0
' we are sorry that this product fell short of those expectations and will investigate the matter with our supplier			0
' as @entity25 's most venomous spider species , false widows made headlines last year when victims told how they had suffered huge wounds and almost lost limbs			0
an entire secondary school was shut in october in the @entity137 , @entity138 , after an outbreak of the arachnids in its @entity142 block had to be fumigated			0
in the worst cases , suspected bite victims have been treated in hospital or complained of ongoing health problems several months later			0
but many experts insist the spiders are not particularly dangerous and will only bite if approached or handled			0
there have been no reported deaths from the spiders in @entity25 , where they are believed to have arrived on crates of fruit from the @entity155 in the 1870s			0
it is thought many of the worst reactions happen when bites become infected , rather than being linked to the spider 's venom itself .			0

@entity7 , 28 , bought the red grapes from a co-op store in @entity13
inside she was shocked to see live arachnid - before spotting another dead
supermarket chain apologised and believes bag was *imported* from @entity117
