fury : lord @entity1 has been criticised for citing fallen soldiers to argue against independence military veterans have hit back at the suggestion that voting for @entity7 independence is disrespectful to dead soldiers after a former head of the @entity10 sparked a political row by urging a no vote in thursday 's referendum			1
lord @entity1 said yesterday that if @entity7 left the @entity15 it would be ' letting down ' @entity7 soldiers who died fighting in @entity17			1
but today a group of pro-independence veterans called his comments ' outrageous ' , saying that by invoking the memories of fallen troops he was ' taking their sacrifice in vain '			2
the intervention by @entity1 , who was chief of the general staff between 2006 and 2009 , came as the polls showed @entity26 and no neck - and - neck in the lead - up to the vote this week			0
however , his pleas to keep the @entity31 together for the sake of the dead soldiers ' memory were quickly disowned by other unionists			0
now a group of 18 veterans of the armed forces - including a 102 - year - old @entity39 - have spoken out against the former general			0
' as former @entity15 armed forces personnel , we take the strongest possible exception to the outrageous statement by lord @entity1 implying that our fallen comrades died in support of a no vote in a @entity7 independence referendum			1
' how dare he take their sacrifice in vain and try to turn it to political advantage - particularly having presided over the destruction of @entity7 's historic regiments			2
' people who serve in the armed forces and veterans hold a variety of different views on @entity7 's future			2
we are all voting yes on thursday , others will vote no. ' it is that freedom to decide matters democratically which our service men and women have helped safeguard for generations - it is not about bolstering the position of a self - serving @entity71 establishment - and the people of @entity7 will choose on thursday			0
' veterans : @entity74 , left , and @entity75 , right , are among the former members of the military who have spoken out against @entity1 's comments debate : @entity80 has previously been accused of jeopardising the @entity15 's defence capabilities the signatories include second world war veteran @entity74 , former @entity84 @entity75 , who is now a minister in the @entity7 government , and ex-intelligence officer @entity86			1
lord @entity1 wrote in the @entity87 : ' do the families of @entity7 soldiers who lost their lives between 1969 and 2007 to preserve the territorial integrity of the @entity15 now just say , " well , it no longer matters " ? ' i can not speak for them , but i wonder just how much thought , appreciation and recognition is given to the memory of those who have fought and brought this @entity15 of ours to where it is today , and where it could be in the future			1
' and i really worry on behalf of the wives , mothers and friends of those @entity7 soldiers who died to keep @entity17 in the @entity15			1
' i worry particularly about the extent that we will be letting them down if @entity7 disappears from our country , just on the whim of a few thousand voters willing to gamble on an uncertain future rather than staying within the @entity15 , whose track record is second to none in @entity117			2
' row : the iconic @entity7 battalion the @entity119 marching through @entity120 ( file photo ) shadow foreign secretary @entity122 , who is campaigning against independence , distanced himself from the remarks			1
' i am unyielding in my admiration and respect for the men and women of the @entity15 armed forces and the contribution that @entity7 have played and continue to play in those forces , ' he told @entity132 yesterday			0
' but many @entity15 soldiers have given their lives over the years to defeat fascism and then to defend democracy and let 's be absolutely clear : what we are witnessing here in @entity7 on thursday is an exercise in democracy			0
so i hold no brief for @entity1 this morning			0
' the future of the @entity15 's military has been a hot topic in the referendum campaign , with senior figures warning that @entity7 independence would gravely weaken @entity15 's capabilities			1
the @entity7 government has pledged to ban @entity153 nuclear missiles from sheltering in @entity7 waters , as they do now .			0
