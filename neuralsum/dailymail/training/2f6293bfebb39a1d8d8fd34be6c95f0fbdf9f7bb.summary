by @entity1 reporter published : 08:00 est , 11 september 2013 updated : 11:52 est , 11 september 2013 you might think that tiger cubs would be hard - wired to go after their prey aggressively from an early age			1
but when these wild - beasts - in - training were presented with a juicy rabbit , their predatory instincts seemed to fail them			2
the white rabbit simply jumped around their enclosure , eluding their grasping paws as it outpaced them			0
nervous : these tiger cubs seem not to know what to do when confronted with a rabbit escape : the rabbit 's leaping abilities apparently enabled it to avoid a grisly fate the charming scenes took place at @entity26 in @entity27 in northern @entity28			1
zookeepers there put the rabbit in with the tiger and leopard cubs when they reached the age of two months			1
they hoped to test how well developed the big cats ' wild instincts were by seeing if they would be able to hunt down the rabbit			1
however , the intended prey was apparently able to escape the fierce animals ' attention			2
athletic : the rabbit 's canny escape attempt seemed to outpace this leopard on the prowl success ? one leopard cub got his teeth on the rabbit - but only managed to chomp on its ear stand - off : the tiger apparently tried intimidating the rabbit by giving it the hairdryer treatment the tiny tigers even seemed to shy away from the rabbit , though it was only a quarter of its size			0
photographs of the chase show that the worst any of the predators was able to do was to grab hold of one of the rabbit 's ears			0
the scene was presided over by a mother tiger , separated from the youngsters in another cage			0
@entity71 : the big cats toyed with the rabbit but were not pictured going in for the kill disapproving : the mother tiger would have had no problems catching and eating the white rabbit			0

zookeepers at @entity26 in @entity28 were testing cubs ' instincts
the young tigers and leopards did not seem to know how to hunt prey
