by @entity0 published : 06:23 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 11:58 est , 21 may 2013 @entity1 unveiled a big jump in profits to £ 440million today as it took another step towards privatisation and a £ 3billion stock market flotation later this year			1
the result for the year to march 31 is more than double the £ 152million in 2012 as the state - owned firm benefited from the boom in online shopping and recent efforts to modernise the business , which included offloading £ 37.5billion in pensions liabilities to the government			1
chief executive @entity15 , who last year returned the core postal business to profitability after four successive years of losses , said it was a strong performance and that the transformation of @entity1 was under way			2
the core postal business , which delivers the six - days - a - week universal service to 29million addresses , reported operating profits of £ 331million and improved its margin from 0.5 per cent to 3.9 per cent			1
parcel deliveries now account for almost half of the group 's revenues of £ 9.3billion in the last year			1
the performance is expected to encourage the government to cash in on the turnaround by pressing ahead with a privatisation this year , despite opposition from unions representing postal workers and managers			1
business secretary @entity42 today insisted there was ‘ no alternative ’ to privatising the @entity1 and said the organisation still faces a ‘ fundamental threat ’ from email that meant it must be reformed in order to survive			1
however , unions warned services will go into decline if the business is sold off			0
business secretary @entity42 , pictured in @entity53 today , said there was no alternative to selling off @entity1 it comes after a decade of cost - cutting which has seen employee numbers at the @entity1 fall by around 50,000 to 150,000			1
in its half - year results in november , @entity1 reported that its @entity62 parcel revenues were up by 13 per cent , with parcels representing 47 per cent of total group revenue			1
revenue from letters was 2 per cent higher following an increase in stamp prices earlier in the year , although letter volumes fell by 9 per cent			1
the amount of junk mail also increased , accounting for around half the daily postbag			1
the daily @entity62 mailbag fell by four million over the year to 54 million items			2
ms @entity15 said at the time that @entity1 was climbing out of a ' very deep hole ' , with all parts of the business profitable			0
the preferred sell off option is believed to involve the public buying shares alongside @entity82 investors , in an echo of the ‘ @entity88 ’ campaign that pioneered the public sale of shares in @entity87 in the 1980s			2
at least 10 per cent of the shares have been earmarked for the workforce , although it is not known whether staff will get them for free			0
the @entity94 will this week start balloting @entity1 workers on whether to boycott the post of rival companies in a move which could lead to millions of items being left undelivered			0
around 120,000 members of the @entity94 will vote from tomorrow , with the result due on june 19			0
private mail makes up 44 per cent of the daily post bag , so a boycott would leave 26million items undelivered each day , including energy bills , statements , and business mail contracts won by companies including @entity111 and @entity112			2
the ballot will also gauge opposition to the plans to privatise @entity1 and backing for a campaign of refusing to co-operate with new efficiency measures			2
@entity119 , @entity94 deputy general secretary , said today 's results offered more evidence that @entity1 should be kept in the public sector			0
he added : ‘ improved productivity and modernisation has played a role in these good results			0
@entity127 is n't necessary and it would destabilise the workforce and the good progress being made			0
the support of the workforce is crucial to the success of the company			2
‘ price rises have also clearly played a role in the rise in profits			0
fattening the goose in the short term may lead to volume decline as customers seek alternatives			0
one thing 's clear , under privatisation prices would rise further and services would be hit as private companies operate for profit , not for people			0
