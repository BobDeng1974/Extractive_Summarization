his colleagues later posed at his gravesite five of @entity24 ’s stern - faced colleagues in top hats were later photographed posed around his newly inscribed gravestone in @entity12 cemetery			0
the fading black - and - white picture has now been recreated by five @entity13 police officers currently serving in the @entity12 and @entity31 area as a tribute to the dead pc			1

inspector @entity35 , sgt @entity36 , pc @entity37 , pc @entity38 and pc @entity39 posed at the graveside of @entity8			1
@entity24 was murdered while on duty after being tasked with keeping an eye on local burglar @entity14 , who was suspected of raiding local properties			2
the police officer had spotted @entity14 carrying a suspicious - looking bundle in @entity49 , @entity12 , and went to question him			0
there were shouts and a chase towards the reedbeds beside the @entity54 at the back of @entity49			0
later that morning , after @entity8 failed to return to the police station , a search was made			1
his body was found in the river			0
he had been beaten with a cudgel			2
@entity14 was subsequently caught , charged , tried for murder and sentenced to death			2
he confessed to the crime moments before he was hanged in @entity64 in 1863			2
more than 5,000 people attended the public hanging			0
in addition to the portrait tribute , a special exhibition to honour @entity70 on the 150th anniversary of his murder is to be held at @entity12 and @entity74 with the help of @entity76 @entity42 @entity39 , of @entity31 & @entity77 , said : ' this case shows policing has always been a dangerous profession and that officers put their lives on the line even in comparatively rural areas to protect local communities and catch criminals			1
' we also think that , while many things have changed , the basics of policing — fighting crime , keeping the roads safe and the problems of young men drinking a bit too much on a friday night — will have been largely the same 150 years ago as it is today			0
' my initial idea was just to recreate the photograph to pay some tribute to him but i spoke to @entity101 about the idea and they offered to put on a display to commemorate the anniversary			0
' some exhibits are being transferred from our museum at police headquarters and , thanks to their support , a number of items about policing will now be on view from the end of the month			0
' a @entity76 spokeswoman said : ' in @entity12 ’s day it was expected that officers would blow their whistles to get their colleagues ' attention or shout the phrase " look up , @entity125 , " which would tell the other officers that something was happening — it appears that @entity8 never got that chance			1
' today officers have radios to summon help and , in addition to batons , they carry @entity134 spray and wear stab vests to help protect in the event of attack			0
' the exhibition at @entity12 and @entity74 will feature some of the material associated with the crime , including case papers , as well as other items including the uniform of officers at the time			1
the display will run from november 27 to december 15			0
the museum will be open from 10am to 12.30pm , from tuesday to saturday , and admission is free .			0
