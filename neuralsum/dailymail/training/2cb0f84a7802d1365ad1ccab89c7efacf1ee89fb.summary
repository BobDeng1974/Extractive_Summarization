by @entity0 published : 11:16 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 11:16 est , 17 september 2012 a gay executive has won a six - figure insurance payout after his boyfriend was cleared of torching his home in the throes of a childish ' hissy fit '			2
@entity7 admitted his tendency to what his lover , @entity9 , affectionately called ' @entity11 ' , and described one episode in which he had lain on the floor of a @entity15 branch because he could n’t get his own way about a bacon sandwich			0
however , judge @entity18 today exonerated mr @entity7 , ruling that the fire that gutted the couple ’s then home in @entity22 , was probably caused by a cigarette end carelessly discarded or dislodged by a housemate			1
cleared : @entity9 ( left ) has won a six - figure payout after his boyfriend @entity7 , 41 , ( right ) was cleared of deliberately setting his house on fire in the throes of a childish ' hissy fit ' mr @entity9 returned home from work on the evening of tuesday , january 22 , 2008 , to find his house alight and firefighters battling to put the blaze out			1
the fire , which started in a basement bedroom , caused huge damage and killed three pet cats			1
an information security manager with @entity40 , mr @entity9 , in his forties , shared the four - storey house with 41 - year - old mr @entity7 and two others and made a claim for £ 200,000 against his policy with @entity45 but the company refused to pay up , asserting that mr @entity7 had ' set the fire ' when ‘ intoxicated ' and having what mr @entity9 described in court as ' a @entity51 tantrum '			1
today , judge @entity52 ordered @entity53 to honour the policy after ruling that it was ' more likely than not ' that the blaze was sparked by a smouldering cigarette , carelessly discarded or accidentally dislodged by the couple ’s house mate , @entity58			1
damage : the fire started in a basement bedroom of mr @entity9 's former home in @entity22 and made it uninhabitable			1
three pet cats were also killed in the blaze in contrast to the fiercely house - proud mr @entity7 , who did the cleaning whilst his boyfriend was at work , the judge said miss @entity58 , 35 , was a ' messy person ' who smoked in her bedroom and annoyed him with her untidy habits			1
admitting she did n’t tidy her room ' out of sheer laziness ' , miss @entity58 , from @entity74 , discarded flammable material - including used make - up removal tissues - around her bedroom and the state of her room was ' a serious fire hazard ' , the judge said			2
mr @entity7 had given his evidence calmly and consistently , whereas miss @entity58 was ' to put it at its kindest an overly defensive witness ' who had given ' at least slanted information ' to the police after the fire , leading to mr @entity7 ’s arrest			2
the judge said the most plausible explanation was that the ' naturally careless ' children ’s home care worker had discarded or dislodged a burning cigarette whilst in a tired , anxious and agitated mood following a ' shouting match ' with mr @entity7			1
cause : judge @entity52 ruled that the blaze was ' more likely than not ' sparked by a smouldering cigarette , carelessly discarded or accidentally dislodged by the couple 's house mate , @entity58 housemate : the judge said @entity58 , 35 , was a ' messy person ' who smoked in her bedroom and annoyed mr @entity7 with her untidy habits the court earlier heard the housemates had a ' history ' of rows ' about tidiness ' in the house			1
mr @entity9 , now of @entity110 , @entity111 , had received a text from miss @entity58 while on his way home from work , saying that mr @entity7 had gone into a ' big fat @entity116 ' and that the pair had fallen out			1
the fire was discovered and the house evacuated whilst miss @entity58 , at the foot of whose bed the heart of the blaze was found , was out			0
she subsequently made ' accusations of arson ' against mr @entity7			2
he was arrested , but later released without charge after a police officer described his account as ' very credible '			0
mr @entity9 , in the witness box , admitted his boyfriend was ' rather prone to having hissy fits ' but denied that he would have done anything to damage the house or harm any of its occupants ' @entity7 had tantrums yes , hissy fits , ' he said			1
' i called them @entity51 tantrums - it was like watching a five - year - old stamping and shouting , ' he added			0
sometimes it was just a moan , a complaint			0
on much rarer occasions it was a full stomp the feet and shout			0
generally it was a hissy fit , not a full - on shouting match , a complaint , a bit of attention seeking , ' he went on			0
' what i call a @entity51 tantrum covered a wide spectrum from the full blown row to a little " look at me " attention seeking			0
' defending his boyfriend from the accusation that he would have set the house on fire in a ' rage ' , mr @entity9 said : ' @entity167 is soft - he would n’t lift a finger - it ’s not in his nature			2
' mr @entity7 admitted that the descriptions of ' @entity171 ' were accurate			2
' i do have other types of @entity116			0
i have lain on the floor in @entity15 completely sober and made everybody laugh because i could n’t get my own way about a bacon sandwich , ' he said			0
mr @entity7 admitted that he had been drinking in pubs on the night of the blaze to celebrate his birthday and was ' merry ' before returning home and rowing with miss @entity58 about the state of the kitchen			0
he said that he yelled swearwords at miss @entity58 as she left the house and that the row had been ' on the bad end of the @entity51 tantrum spectrum			0
' judge @entity52 ’s ruling that mr @entity7 did not set the property on fire means @entity191 ’s must honour mr @entity9 ’s insurance policy and pay out for the damage caused by the accidental blaze .			1

@entity196 started in a basement bedroom , made house uninhabitable and killed three cats in january 2008
@entity9 told court his boyfriend @entity7 - *nicknamed* @entity51 - was prone to ' hissy fits ' but would not have started fire
insurance company *believed* mr @entity7 did start fire because he was angry following an *argument* with another housemate over ' tidiness '
judge rules fire was ' more likely than not ' sparked by smouldering cigarette , carelessly discarded or accidentally dislodged by couple 's housemate
