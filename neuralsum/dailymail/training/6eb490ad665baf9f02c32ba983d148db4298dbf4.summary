‘ it was one person ’s word against another , ’ he said			0
‘ if there were no grounds for applying for the revocation of a firearms licence the guns would be returned to the firearms licence holder			0
’ commenting on firearms regulations , mr @entity230 said : ‘ at the moment it is fairly subjective – the police are responsible for carrying out an assessment of whether an individual is a fit and proper person to hold a firearms licence			2
