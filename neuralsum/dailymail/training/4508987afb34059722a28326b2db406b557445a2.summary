by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:47 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 03:02 est , 10 december 2012 @entity4 is losing the war on drugs and should consider the radical option of legalisation , a powerful committee of mps will argue this week			1
in a controversial move which could lead to yet another @entity12 rift , the influential @entity9 is expected to put pressure on @entity14 to establish a @entity15 to draw up changes to the law			1
the mps have concluded that prison sentences – which can be up to life for dealers of heroin and cocaine – are failing to deter drugs barons , and may even be encouraging a crime - riddled black market in the substances			2
pressure : @entity14 , left , will be told by the @entity9 , which heard evidence from witnesses including @entity30 , right , that current drug laws are no longer ' fit for purpose ' despite a youthful flirtation with the idea of drugs liberalisation when he first became an mp , the prime minister is now opposed to the idea – as is the majority of his party			1
but a number of senior @entity42 recently backed reforms under which drug users would receive treatment rather than be classed as criminals			0
last night , an mp on the @entity9 – which took evidence from dozens of witnesses , including comedian and reformed addict @entity30 – told @entity51 that current laws were no longer ‘ fit for purpose ’			1
the mp said : ‘ the general view [ of the committee ] was that the drug laws in @entity4 are all a bit out - dated			1
we have a @entity59 that ’s really outlived its usefulness and that really belongs in the 1960s and 1970s			0
' it seems to deal with the drugs world as a fairly simple market with a relatively small number of controlled substances out there			2
but that ’s not the case			0
’ the mp added that , although the committee ‘ had not reached a settled view ’ on the decriminalisation of drugs , its members agreed @entity4 was ‘ fighting a losing battle over drugs policy ’			1
holding forth : comedian and actor @entity30 tells the @entity79 that the government needed to change its approach to combating drug addiction among the young in need of reform : @entity30 told the @entity79 that he once ' loved ' heroin details of the report will not be revealed until its publication tomorrow , but it is understood that it will call on the prime minister to establish a @entity15 on drugs to report in time for the next general election in 2015			1
although the conclusions of such commissions are not binding on governments , they have such clout that it is politically difficult for @entity100 to reject their findings out of hand			0
the mps are not expected to specify which drugs could be subject to the relaxation			2
but their report follows the controversial decision by two @entity109 states , @entity110 and @entity111 , to decriminalise cannabis – a move expected to be copied widely throughout the @entity109			0
the committee also studied the situation in @entity116 where , for the past decade , it has only been an ‘ administrative offence ’ , not a criminal , one to possess small amounts of any drug			2
as a result , say supporters , criminal offences such as robbery have fallen , as have @entity126 infections from dirty needles used to inject heroin			0
confusion : the @entity4 public are bombarded with differing views on the best ways to combat drug addiction according to the most recent @entity4 poll on the subject , conducted by @entity137 , 49 per cent of voters supports keeping the law on drugs as it is , while 45 per cent support liberalising the law on soft drugs – either by downgrading offences or completely decriminalising drug use			1
in the @entity4 , under the @entity145 , possession of @entity148 drugs – ecstasy , lsd , heroin , cocaine , crack and magic mushrooms – carries a jail sentence of up to seven years , while dealing carries a term of up to life			1
class b drugs – including cannabis , amphetamines and unprescribed @entity160 – carry a five - year sentence for possession and 14 years for dealing			0
even dealing in @entity164 drugs , such as tranquilisers , carries a possible sentence of 14 years – more than the maximum prison term for gun dealers			0
supporters of decriminalisation cite the example of gay marriage , which has gone from being a marginal issue to a key area of policy debate			2
the committee is also expected to call for responsibility for drugs policy to be switched from the @entity179 to the @entity180 , as part of a shift in policy emphasis from ‘ criminality ’ to ‘ medical addiction ’			1
punishment : possession of @entity148 drugs , such as heroin , pictured , carries a jail term of up to seven years while being caught with @entity164 drugs – including cannabis – carries a five - year sentence			0
( posed by model ) in his evidence to the committee , mr @entity30 said that taking drugs should not be seen as a ‘ criminal or judicial matter ’ and users should be shown more compassion			1
he argued that drug addiction was primarily a health matter , and while he approved of partial decriminalisation , he opposed a ‘ wacky free - for - all ’			1
in his 2007 autobiography , mr @entity30 described his extensive use of drugs and how his ‘ love ’ of heroin in particular had damaged his relationships , health and career			1
addiction : @entity30 , pictured before attending the @entity214 , spoke about his extensive use of drugs and how his ¿ love ¿ of heroin one mp on the committee revealed : ‘ we are going to back a @entity15 as the way forward			1
’ @entity15 – made up of a panel of experts appointed by the government and headed by a distinguished public figure such as a judge – have been used over the last 200 years to find answers on the key issues of the day , covering everything from the width of railway gauges to capital punishment			0
the most recent was the 1998 @entity15 on long - term care for the elderly			0
the @entity237 report comes ten years after the committee ’s previous examination of drugs laws			2
that committee ’s call for @entity243 to be legally downgraded was firmly rejected by @entity244 , the home secretary at the time			0
@entity245 , a @entity246 member of the committee , distanced herself from the report , claiming colleagues were on a ‘ slippery slope ’ by even discussing legalisation			2
last year , @entity252 , head of the @entity42 committee on @entity237 , called on ministers to establish an independent panel to examine the @entity116 experiment and to consider the ‘ costs and benefits ’ of decriminalisation or legalisation			2
but former @entity246 shadow home secretary @entity261 said : ‘ the failure of drugs policy is at the centre of a whole range of criminal problems from organised crime through petty pilfering			1
' so what is needed is a firm implementation of clear anti-drugs policies – not procrastination that appeases today ’s metropolitan elite , who are surrounded by a haze of confusion			0
’ fellow @entity246 mp @entity277 said : ‘ there ’s a liberal , fashionable view at the moment that will back softening the drugs laws as they back gay marriage			1
' but making these drugs legal is not the answer – the answer is to break up the gangs that deal in these substances			0
' we should not be giving these gangs any encouragement by giving the impression we ’re setting off down the soft route of decriminalising hard drugs			0
’ last night , @entity294 , chairman of the all - party group on drugs policy reform at @entity297 , said a full review of drugs laws was now needed to cope with the influx of new drugs			1
she said : ‘ these are coming on the market at the rate of one a week – we can not cope any longer			2
’ last night , a government spokesperson said : ' drugs are illegal because they are harmful - they destroy lives and blight communities			2
' our current laws draw on the best available evidence and as such we have no intention of downgrading or declassifying cannabis			1
' a @entity15 on drugs is simply not necessary			0
our cross-government approach is working			0
' drug usage is at its lowest level since records began and people going into treatment today are far more likely to free themselves from dependency than ever before			0
' we will respond to the report more fully in due course			0

cameron under pressure to consider @entity30 option of decriminalisation
current laws ' no longer fit for purpose '
@entity9 says @entity4 was ‘ fighting a losing battle over drugs policy ’
