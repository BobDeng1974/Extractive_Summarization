the parents of @entity1 have revealed the reasons behind their torturous decision to accept ' blood money ' from @entity5 after he shot their daughter			1
june and @entity7 were given £ 340 a month by the athlete in a series of deposits that began several weeks after the model 's death on @entity13 last year			1
mrs @entity1 said the payments made her feel ' uncomfortable ' but felt the family had no option after they were declared bankrupt and evicted by their landlord			1
her husband had also suffered a stroke as a result of his grief two months after @entity24 was gunned down			2
but mrs @entity1 has vowed to pay ' every single cent ' of the £ 6,300 total back , declaring : ' my child was priceless			1
he ca n't buy her life			1
we were in such a bad way , we did n’t even have food on the table			0
it was that or starve			0
' the @entity55 also refused a lump sum payment of £ 21,000 which he raised from the sale of his car			1
mrs @entity1 said : ' @entity5 has made us other offers which we turned down			2
' thankfully now we are in a position where we can say we do n't want any money from him			2
' details of the payments were initially revealed at the @entity68 's sentencing hearing , to the surprise of many in court , when he was jailed for five years for miss @entity1 's manslaughter			1
@entity7 suffered a stroke around two months after his daughter was killed as a result of his grief mrs @entity1 has written a book , published this week , called @entity78 : a mother ’s story in which she dismisses outright @entity5 's account of the night he killed her daughter			1
she said she believes @entity5 shot the 29 - year - old dead after a furious row - not , as in the runner 's version , fearing that she was a dangerous intruder			1
' @entity5 's story i do n't believe , ' she wrote in the book , released weeks after the athlete was found not guilty of murder and sentenced to five years in prison on a lesser manslaughter charge			1
' not one of his actions suggests he felt protective towards her			0
' they had a fight , a horrible argument , and she fled to the bathroom with her mobile and locked the door			0
' i think he may have shot once and then he had to go on and kill her because she would have been able to tell the world what really happened , what he is really like			2
' there is no doubt in our minds : she had decided to leave @entity5 that night , ' she wrote , adding that @entity24 had indicated that the pair had not had sex			0
' i believe their relationship was coming to an end			0
in her heart of hearts she did n't think it was making either of them happy			2
' take him down : @entity5 is led away from court after being sentenced to five years in jail for the manslaughter of the 29 - year - old model ' it was @entity45 's bad luck that she met him , because sooner or later he would have killed someone			1
' mrs @entity1 also described the desperate pain of not being there to help her daughter in her time of need , of medication to numb the anguish and of her husband @entity7 's recent stroke			1
' in our worst imaginings , we picture how scared she must have been to retreat behind that door , and lock it , with no one to protect her			0
' one bullet blew the brains out of her skull			0
' miss @entity1 added that while she forgives @entity5 , she would like to meet him to ask questions			0
' i have forgiven him			0
i have to - that 's my religion			2
but i ca n't forget what he has done			1
i hate what he has done to my child			0
' in the book , @entity1 describes at length the pain of seven months of tortured court hearings , culminating in a verdict which the state has described as ' shockingly light ' and will appeal			0
' i felt let down by the justice system , ' said @entity1			0
she described @entity5 's account of events as ' vague , evasive and shifty			2
' ' i was so shocked that he was actually standing there saying not guilty to every single charge			0
how could he say that when @entity45 is dead and he shot her ? ' ' he has to live for the rest of his life with the knowledge of what he 's done			1
' prosecutors are appealing the manslaughter verdict and five - year sentence after failing secure a murder conviction .			0
