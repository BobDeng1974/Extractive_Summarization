more witnesses in the death of @entity2 have changed their stories about what happened on the night he was shot dead by @entity6 in a gated community in @entity8			1
at least four key witnesses have changed their story and more may come forward as the case moves closer to trial , according to the @entity13			1
a report from the paper comes after state prosecutors released about half the evidence they have in their second - degree murder case against @entity6 , 28			1
final picture : as part of the ongoing court preparations , @entity6 's team submitted photos last week of @entity2 caught on the convenience store 's camera in his favor : public opinion has shifted so that now 40 per cent of @entity28 believe @entity6 acted in self defense , which is up from only 15 per cent who believe such in march the witnesses - who are only identified by numbers - first made statements to the @entity35 on or close to the night of february 26			1
later , around mid-march , they had to repeat their statements to the @entity37 and state prosecutors			0
three of the witnesses altered what they thought had happened			2
one changed her story completely			1
witness two - a young woman who lives in the retreat at @entity47 community , where @entity2 was shot - was interviewed three times and each time her account was different			2
she did not have her contact lenses in at the time but said she saw two men running and then a fist fight			0
the second time she said she saw two men standing ten feet apart			0
when she was interviewed the final time , by an @entity37 agent , she said she saw just one person running away and could not tell if it was a man or woman , black or white			0
witness six - a man who lived at a home a few feet away from where @entity2 was shot - first told police he saw the teen on top of @entity6 and said he was raining punches down on him ' mixed martial arts - style '			1
he also said @entity6 was yelling for help			2
weeks later however , he said , he was not sure who was yelling for help or if @entity72 was punching him or simply pinning him to the ground			0
the only thing he was sure of was that the teenager was on top			0
witness 12 - a young mother from the same community - told police she saw two figures on the ground but was not sure who was on top			0
but at the end of march she said she was sure it was @entity6 on top as she recognized his shape and build from seeing him on the tv			2
witness 13 - another man who lived close by - did not see the altercation between the pair but gave an account of @entity6 's demeanor when he spoke to him after he heard the gun shot fire			1
he said he came out to see the neighborhood watchman with blood on the back of his head and a body next to him			0
the 28 - year - old said @entity2 had been ' beating up on me , so i had to shoot him '			2
then he asked him to call his wife to let her know			0
weeks later he described @entity105 's tone as being ' no big deal '			0
' it was n't like , " i ca n't believe i shot someone " , but just , " tell my wife " , like it was nothing , ' the witness said			0
all the witnesses will likely be interviewed again before the trial starts			0
surrounding area : in the weeks and months following the february 26 altercation , many neighbors have given their stories as witnesses difficult to tell : some witnesses said that the dark night made it difficult to tell who was straddling whom their changes reflect a softening view of @entity2 , likely due to the massive media attention the case has received , and the fact they have become aware of the circumstances around what they saw at the time of the attack			1
the changing opinions of both the public and the key witnesses in the case confirm that the trial of the teen 's killer will be constantly evolving			2
a new poll says that public opinion is shifting as 40 per cent @entity28 believe that the unarmed 17 - year - old was killed in self defense			1
that number shows a significant jump up from only 15 per cent of people siding with @entity6 's version of events when asked in march when the attack sparked a national firestorm			1
according to the @entity152 released yesterday , only 24 per cent say the fatal incident was murder , denoting a decrease since the last poll when 33 per cent believed that to be the case in march			2
regardless , @entity6 was been charged with second - degree murder and his trial will unfold in the coming months as he waived his right to a speedy trial in an effort to guarantee that his legal team can be fully prepared when it does go to court			1
preparations : both sides are submitting evidence in the coming days as @entity6 is in hiding while @entity6 's lawyers entered in their extensive list of witnesses and evidence last week , the specifics of the witness changes came as a preview of the evidence due to be used by the prosecution			1
special prosecutor @entity175 turned a eight - page document to the @entity178 clerk on monday which spelled out the changed testimony .			0

new poll says 40 per cent of @entity28 think @entity6 acted in self defense , up from only 15 per cent two months *ago*
comes as four witnesses have changed their story or added *details* that support @entity2 's side of the story
