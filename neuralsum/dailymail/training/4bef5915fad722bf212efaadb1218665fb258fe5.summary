by @entity0 published : 12:59 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 08:35 est , 22 february 2013 a giant sunspot that is at least six times the diameter of @entity4 has formed on the @entity5 in less than 48 hours , @entity1 has announced			1
sunspots are dark spots on the surface of the @entity5 which appear as turbulent magnetic fields in its surface rearrange and realign			0
the massive sunspot , which formed over the course of tuesday and wednesday , quickly evolved into an unstable configuration , and could lead to solar flares , which can interrupt our radio communications			1
these two sunspots are part of the same system and are over six earths across @entity1 scientists spotted the huge sunspot forming through instruments on the agency 's @entity30 , one of several spacecraft that monitor the @entity5 's weather			1
' over the course of february 19 - 20 , 2013 , scientists watched a giant sunspot form in under 48 hours , ' said @entity36 , a spokesman for @entity1			1
' it has grown to over six @entity4 diameters across but its full extent is hard to judge since the spot lies on a sphere not a flat disk			0
' the sunspot identified by @entity1 is formed of several dark blemishes on the surface on the @entity5 which have evolved rapidly over the past couple of days			1
the @entity30 contains a suite of instruments that will provide observations leading to a more complete understanding of the solar dynamics that drive variability in the @entity4 's environment			1
this set of instruments : sunspots are caused by intense magnetic activity and are actually cooler than the rest of the @entity5 , which leaves them clearly visible as dark spots in the photosphere			0
in reality , if the sunspot were isolated from the surrounding photosphere it would be brighter than an electric arc			2
ms @entity36 added : ' the spot quickly evolved into what 's called a delta region , in which the lighter areas around the sunspot , the penumbra , exhibit magnetic fields that point in the opposite direction of those fields in the center , dark area			1
' this is a fairly unstable configuration that scientists know can lead to eruptions of radiation on the sun called solar flares			1
' the observation comes as the @entity5 is gearing up for the most active phase of its 11 - year solar cycle			2
the @entity5 's magnetic field lines are the most distorted at this time due to the magnetic field on the solar equator rotating at a slightly faster pace than at the solar poles			2
this causes large numbers of sunspots appear , and the @entity5 's irradiance output grows by about 0.1 per cent			0
the increased energy output of solar maxima can impact global climate and recent studies have shown some correlation with regional weather patterns			0
the solar cycle takes an average of about 11 years to go from one solar maximum to the next , with an observed variation in duration of 9 to 14 years for any given solar cycle			0
large solar flares often occur during a maximum			2
for example , the @entity111 struck the @entity4 with such intensity the northern lights could be seen as far south as @entity115			0
the last solar maximum was in 2000			0
in 2006 @entity1 initially expected a solar maximum in 2010 or 2011 , and thought that it could be the strongest since 1958			2
however , more recent projections say the maximum should arrive in autumn of 2013 and be the smallest sunspot cycle since 1906 .			0

the sunspot quickly evolved into an unstable configuration and could lead to solar flares , @entity1 warns
the agency 's @entity30 watched it form in less than 48 hours over tuesday and wednesday
