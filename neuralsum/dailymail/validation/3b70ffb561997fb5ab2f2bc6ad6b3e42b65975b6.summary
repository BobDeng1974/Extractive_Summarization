many of the planets discovered elsewhere in our galaxy are not like @entity4 , but rather more like @entity5			1
such gas giants , as far as we know , are not hospitable to life , but now it has been suggested that the moons of these planets could be habitable			2
if confirmed , it would suggest these locations could be the predominant sources for life in the universe , not worlds like our own @entity4			1
the idea was discussed by dr @entity18 of the @entity19 in @entity20 , on the @entity21 's ( @entity21 ) show @entity22			1
scroll down for audio dr @entity18 of the @entity19 was speaking to @entity21			1
she said exomoons could be the ' predominant sites of life in the universe '			1
shown is an illustration of @entity30 , the large world in the distance , orbiting the gas giant in the foreground , which could have habitable moons she explained how @entity5 - sized planets in the habitable zones of stars - where conditions are ideal for water , and perhaps life - are more common than single rocky worlds like @entity4			1
hot exomoons too close to a star and an exomoon may have an average temperature above the boiling point of water , making it highly unsuitable for any form of life			0
habitable exomoons exoplanets orbiting in a system ’s habitable zone ( where liquid water can persist on a planet ’s surface ) still need sufficient gravity to trap an atmosphere that regulates their temperature			0
if these conditions are met , however , the prospects for life are promising			0
snowball exomoons moons formed in the outer reaches of an alien solar system are likely to be dominated by ice			1
they will remain deep - frozen unless heated by tides from their parent planet - again these are unlikely to be habitats for life			0
transient exomoons moons of planets with elliptical orbits might be habitable for most of their planet ’s year , but can experience hot or snowball periods as they venture too close to their star , or too far from its life - giving heat			2
source : all about @entity85 magazine ‘ if even some of these @entity5 - sized planets have moons , they might be the predominant sites of life in the universe , ’ she said			1
in particular , she focused on the world of @entity30 , a gas giant exoplanet about 10 times the mass of @entity5 , located 44 light - years from @entity4			2
while the planet itself is not thought to be habitable , it is possible that a moon in its orbit - known as an exomoon - could be			0
and if you were to step on the surface of the moon , you would see ‘ beautiful tumultuous clouds on the @entity5 planet ’ and ‘ incredibly complex cloud activity , ’ according to dr @entity18			1
so far , no exomoons have been discovered , but given that six of the eight planets in our solar system have moons , most astronomers regard it as an inevitability rather than a possibility that one will be found			1
it might be possible to find one in data collected by @entity120 ’s kepler space telescope , or it may be necessary to wait for a more powerful planet - hunter to come online , such as the @entity122 ( @entity122 ) , due to launch in 2017			0
finding exomoons is a bit of a problem though , as their mass and size is so much less than their host planet			0
one technique to find them that may prove successful is gravitational microlensing , which uses a foreground star to magnify a more distant one			0
the chance alignment can reveal exoplanets around a star , and could possibly even be used to spot a moon in orbit			0

it might be possible to find one in data collected by @entity120 ’s @entity119 ( illustration shown ) and we are able to rule certain planets out - ones that are too close to their host star , like @entity156 and @entity157 in our own solar system , are unable to cling on to natural satellites			2
but finding out if moons are common in our galaxy will be key for the search for life , and could signal a change in goals for planet - hunters in the near future			0
‘ the fact we reside on a single rocky hunk of rock , orbiting without a big brother planet , might be relatively unusual , ’ added dr @entity18			2
one technique to find moons could be gravitational microlensing , which uses a foreground star to magnify a more distant one , as shown in this diagram			0

many planets discovered outside the solar system are @entity5 - sized worlds
it suggests habitable @entity4 - like planets may not be that common
instead , moons orbiting larger planets could be the best *bet* for life
