for most men , turning a pot - belly into a rippling six - pack is the stuff of dreams			1
but @entity5 , 34 , turned it into a reality - transforming his physique in a mere eight weeks			1
the father - of - five , from @entity9 , @entity10 , who had padded out thanks to a lack of exercise underwent the dramatic transformation			1
although he used to be a personal trainer , and still writes books on fitness , he works mainly as a shadow writer , which sees him spending most of his day sitting at a desk			0
' i used to be in denial about how sloppy i had become , ' he admits			1
' once i started taking photos , i realised how much i had been lying and hiding from myself			0
i felt like i was not man enough to be the father of five children			2
' ' worst of all , i knew what to do			0
as a fitness author , who made a living telling people how to stay in shape , one would expect me to treat my body like a temple			0
but i did n't , i just drowned myself in excuses and denial			0
and of course a lot of food			2
' a tough financial start to 2014 saw @entity5 spend more time at work , at the cost of his health			1
left : week two of @entity5 's self designed fitness programme , and right , week three ' i was stressed and needed to work , i did n't even think about what i ate , i just ate what i could			1
i barely saw my kids , i just worked and worked , substituting sleep with food			2
' ' because i lived ' in the moment ' and every day i felt i ' deserved ' to have a variety of treats and junk food			2
' when his father died unexpectedly in june , @entity5 found himself rethinking his priorities			1
' at the funeral i saw my brother , who works much longer , harder hours than me , and he had abs. breakfast : porridge with milk and honey lunch : whole loaf of bread with chicken and mayo or cheese and avocado dinner : take away meal snacks : crackers with cheese , toast breakfast : egg white and banana smoothie lunch : can of tuna with tomato and onion second lunch : white fish with lots of steamed vegetables dinner : 400g rump steak ' while i was stuffing my gob with cupcakes , i watched him eat salad			0
i realised then that i did n't have to choose between health and work			2
i could fit both in			0
' working out everyday for 30 minutes , @entity5 , decided to work exercise into his family life , rather than trying to fit it in around it			1
' i created a program for myself using periodised strength and conditioning that would allow me to use my kids as resistance , so that i could play with them and get exercise in			2
kids make great kettlebell replacements , and even better personal trainers because they wo n't ever stop asking for " one more rep "			0
' @entity122 ( left ) of the transformation sees a marked increase in definition , while week five ( right ) a clear size difference can be seen in the width of @entity5 's torso he also totally transformed his diet , eating purely for nutrition rather than comfort			1
' every meal is accounted for and calculated in advance , so i do n't have any way to cheat			0
i created a web app that calculated what my calories and macros needed to be in order to get to my body fat goal			0
once i had calculated it , i designed a meal plan for the day that i stuck to every single day , ' he explains			2
in less than eight weeks , @entity5 dropped his body fat from an unhealthy 20 per cent to less than 8 per cent , and had the abs to show for it			1
week six : @entity148 workouts and a strict diet plan have seen @entity5 totally change his physique as soon as he got home , @entity5 set about fixing his diet , using proven mathematical formulas for fat loss			1
it was n't until he combined the nutrition with fast , effective workouts in the back yard that he started to see dramatic results			0
speaking about his new transformed body , @entity5 says : ' now , i feel empowered , i have conquered my inner glutton			1
' the weight loss was secondary			0
i had become far more efficient at work , and as a result of the good food , became a lot kinder with the kids , who i would involve with my exercising			1
they deserved fun from me , not work related anger			0
' @entity5 and wife @entity171 with their children @entity174 , 18 , @entity175 , 4 , @entity176 , 3 , @entity177 , 2 , and @entity178 , 7 months he is so enthusiastic about his methods that he has now created the @entity181 program to help other working fathers to ' get lean , without killing their kids			1
' ' @entity184 is part how - to and part documentary			0
i wanted to show dads exactly how to do it			0
but i also wanted them to see the suffering and hard work that goes with losing weight			1
' it 's not all sunshine and roses , but if i can do it , any dad can			0
