from delicate swirls of raised flesh to intricate dotted patterns , the scars that decorate the bodies of @entity6 's @entity5 tribes are more than just the sign of an old injury			1
for these are n't just any scars : they 're an elaborate part of local culture and signify everything from beauty to adulthood or even , in some cases , are simply a mark of belonging			0
but @entity21 tribes are n't the only ones to embrace scarification			0
in @entity25 , the @entity24 are famous for their elaborate scar patterns , while across @entity6 's border with @entity31 , @entity29 men bear scarred foreheads and consider getting them a key part of the transition from boy to man			1
@entity46 people regard scars as a sign of beauty and strength neighbours : both the @entity56 ( both images ) and @entity40 tribes bear facial scarifications but despite living only a few miles apart , regularly oppose each other beauty : a woman from the @entity56 tribe who live close to the @entity40 in the @entity64			1
both are currently under threat of being displaced by encroaching plantations now the stunning scar markings of @entity6 and @entity31 are the subject of an incredible set of photographs by @entity73 snapper , @entity74 , who travelled through the country observing cutting ceremonies and meeting the locals			1
during a visit to the @entity40 tribe , who live in the country 's remote @entity64 , he witnessed a scarification ceremony , which involved creating the patterns using thorns and a razor			2
' @entity89 - year - old girl who was being cut did n't say a word during the 10 - minute ceremony and refused to show any pain , ' he revealed			1
' her mother used a thorn to pull the skin out and a razor blade to cut the skin			0
' at the end , i asked her whether having her skin cut had been tough and she replied that she was close to collapse			0
it was incredible as she did n't show any sign of pain on her face during the ceremony as that would have been seen as shameful for the family			2
' what 's more , he explained , despite the pain , the girl herself initiated the ceremony as @entity40 girls are n't obliged to take part			1
' scars are a sign of beauty within the tribe , ' he added			2
' children who go to school or convert to @entity121 do n't do it but the others see the ability to cope with pain as a sign that they will be able to cope with childbirth in future			0
' varied : while some tribes such as the @entity131 , also from the @entity132 , focus on the shoulders , the @entity40 and others also include the face and head ( right ) ceremony : a @entity40 scarification ritual using thorns and a razor is carried out on a 12 - year - old girl who volunteered to be scarred painful : although the process is n't without pain , @entity74 says the girl kept a straight face throughout in order not to shame her family end result : after the initial cut , scars have organic sap or ash rubbed into them in order to make them heal as raised bumps intricate : scar patterns are n't reserved solely for @entity40 women - men , as pictured right , also have intricate patterns made from dotted scars other tribes who live in the @entity64 , among them the @entity160 , also embrace scarification and often use sap or ash to make the resulting wounds more prominent when they heal			1
but it seems that not everyone is impressed			0
' people wearing scarifications are seen as " primitives " by many urban @entity21 and suffer from this , ' @entity74 explains			0
' those who have had them but have been to school as well often try to hide them			0
' others , such as the @entity46 tribe , consider scars a sign of beauty and strength , although as @entity74 relates , thanks to an influx of workers from other parts of @entity6 , scarification is becoming an increasingly risky business			2
' using shared blades is a huge problem in the south @entity64 region , ' explains @entity74			0
' @entity189 is starting to become a problem as workers from other parts of @entity6 arrive to work on the new giant [ government - sponsored ] plantations			2
@entity195 is also becoming a threat			0
' @entity160 : @entity197 , pictured on the left , now hides her elaborate scar markings after being ridiculed for having them at school			0
others such as this woman ( right ) embrace them tradition : other tribes to embrace scarification include the afar people , who live in @entity6 and are famous for using butter in their hair popular : facial tattoos are particularly common among the @entity213 , especially for women , and can include both dot and line patterns tradition : although this @entity219 ( left ) and @entity221 woman live in different parts of @entity6 , both have embraced their respective tribe 's scarification rituals despite the risks , scarification continues to play a huge role in tribal life , not least across the border in @entity31 where scars are a distinctive feature of life for the @entity234 people			1
@entity31 's second largest ethnic group after the @entity236 , the majority of adult nuer men have ' gaar ' markings - six lines carved on either side of their foreheads - as a sign of maturity			1
other @entity234 , particularly the @entity29 of the @entity246 , create a dotted version of gaar and women sometimes have them too			1
the neighbouring @entity251 tribe , which lives in both @entity6 and @entity31 has also embraced scarification but combine facial dot patterns with elaborate body etchings as well			2
although the @entity251 etchings remain popular with younger generations , the @entity29 's gaar markings are becoming increasingly rare as conflict between them and other @entity31 tribes becomes more frequent			1
' this tradition is n't done as much anymore , ' explains @entity74			0
' partly , it 's because of better education and the increasing number of people who have turned to @entity121 but also because it is a too visible sign of tribal belonging in an area that has suffered many disputes			0
' distinctive : many @entity234 men are eschewing ' gaar ' lines such as these because they are a clear indication of belonging to the tribe - dangerous when conflict looms elaborate : the markings adopted by the @entity251 tribe of @entity31 are among the most intricate and involve serried rows of dotted lines delicate : the dotted patterns that encircle the eyes of @entity251 men and women are just as beautiful as their elaborate body markings			1

tribes who scarify include @entity6 's @entity289 tribes , @entity31 's @entity234 and @entity25 's @entity24
@entity40 girls choose to go through the process voluntarily and must not show pain during the 10 - minute ritual
gaar scars are a sign of maturity for @entity29 men but fewer are doing it thanks to *inter-tribal* conflict
