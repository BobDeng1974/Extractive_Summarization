@entity1 scientists have come up with an intriguing new idea to combat global warming - blasting the surface of asteroids to create giant clouds of dust which would act as sunscreen for the planet			1
researchers at the @entity11 believe a suitably sized asteroid could be moved into a position close to earth before a giant cloud of dust is blasted off its surface			1
and because an asteroid creates a gravitational pull , the dust is held in position rather than being gradually dispersed across space			1
solar shield : @entity1 scientists believe an asteroid could be moved into position before a giant cloud of dust is blasted from the surface to act as a sunscreen the idea is the latest in a series of ambitious projects , known as geoengineering , which aim to alter the climate of the planet by reflecting , diverting or absorbing solar radiation			1
research by he @entity38 ' @entity39 suggests average global temperatures will increase by between @entity41 and @entity42 by the end of this century			0
@entity44 , one of the research team at the @entity11 told live science : ' people sometimes get the idea of giant screens blocking the entire sun. ' this is not the case ... as [ the device ] is constantly between the sun and the earth , it acts merely as a very light shade or filter			0
' ' i would like to make it clear that i would never suggest geoengineering in place of reducing our carbon emissions			2
the asteroid would be moved into position at what is known as @entity68 , a point in space where the gravitational pull of the @entity72 and the @entity73 balance each other out ' we can buy time to find a lasting solution to combat @entity73 â€™s climate change			1
the dust cloud is not a permanent cure , but it could offset the effects of climate change for a given time to allow slow - acting measures like carbon capture to take effect			2
' an earlier proposal to shade @entity73 from the sun involved placing giant mirrors in space			0
however this is seen as impractical due to the massive cost of building the giant mirrors and blasting them into orbit or constructing them in outer - space			0
another idea involved using blankets of dust to blot out the sun in the same way clouds do on earth			2
however while this would be considerably cheaper than placing mirrors in space it is believed the dust would be dispersed due to the gravitational pull of the sun , moon and other planets			1
so the @entity1 team came up with the novel idea of using an asteroid 's own gravitational pull to effectively anchor the cloud of dust and stop it drifting away			1
the asteroid would be placed at what is known as @entity68 , a point in space where the gravitational pull of the sun and the @entity73 balance each other out			1
@entity126 is about four times the distance from @entity73 to the moon			0
the asteroid would be fitted with a ' mass driver , ' powerful electromagnets that , as well as acting as an engine to maneuver the asteroid into position , could also blast a cloud of dust away from its surface			1
the researchers have identified the largest near - @entity73 asteroid , 1036 @entity141 , as a suitable candidate			0
they believe @entity141 could generate a dust cloud large enough to block out 6.58 per cent of solar radiation reaching earth , more than enough to combat any current levels of global warming			2
the dust cloud generated would be about 5 quadrillion ( 5,000,000,000,000,000 ) kilograms in mass and about 1,600 miles wide			2
the research team , from the @entity11 , estimate a suitably - sized asteroid could generate a dust cloud large enough to block out 6.58 per cent of solar radiation reaching earth mr @entity44 said : ' a very large asteroid is a potential threat to @entity73 , and therefore great care and testing would be required in the implementation of this scenario			1
' due to this , the political challenges would probably match the scale of the engineering challenge			0
even for the capture of much smaller asteroids , there will likely be reservations from all areas of society , though the risks would be much less			0
' the main challenge for the scientists is finding a way of moving such a large asteroid into place			1
mr @entity44 added : ' the company @entity175 recently announced their intention to mine asteroids			0
' the study that they base their plans on reckons that it will be possible to capture an asteroid with a mass of 500,000 kilograms by 2025			0
' comparing this to the mass of @entity141 makes the task of capturing it seem unfeasible , at least in everything except the very far term			0
' however , smaller asteroids could be moved and clustered at the first @entity126 point			0

@entity1 scientists believe an asteroid could be maneuvered into position before a cloud of dust is blasted from the surface
because an asteroid has its own gravitational pull , the dust would be anchored in place
