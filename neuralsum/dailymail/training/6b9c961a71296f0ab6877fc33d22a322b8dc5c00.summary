by @entity0 published : 12:29 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 02:52 est , 23 november 2012 a deputy council leader has stood down after it emerged he watched a hardcore porn dvd on his work laptop			1
@entity6 @entity5 admitted watching a pornographic movie called she likes it rough at home with his wife @entity11 , 51 , who is also a councillor			1
but while the cabinet lead member for adults and communities admitted making an ‘ error of judgment ’ when the couple watched the film at home in bed , he is far from embarrassed about it			2
to help their relationship : councillor @entity5 ( right ) admitted to watching hardcore porn film ' she likes it rough ' on a council laptop with wife @entity28 ( left ) because their home dvd player broke mr @entity5 , 56 , yesterday said the film was one of the ‘ tools ’ the couple used to ‘ help ’ their relationship			1
the dvd was found when mr @entity5 took his laptop to council it workers for repairs			1
he said : ‘ the laptop crashed and i took it to get it repaired			2
i should have taken the film out and put it back in its box			0
‘ i was probably rushing around the next morning and grabbed it before going in to @entity47			0
‘ me and the wife use things to help our relationship			0
that ’s one of the tools we use			0
it ’s one of those situations that should n’t have happened			0
‘ i ’m not embarrassed			0
there was nothing dodgy about it			0
‘ it ’s the kind of thing that can easily be bought in an adult shop			0
’ the incident took place in 2007 , but has only just come to light after a copy of a confidential letter sent to mr @entity5 by former @entity69 monitoring officer @entity68 was anonymously leaked to a local newspaper			1
in the letter , miss @entity68 said the dvd had been sent to the police ‘ to ensure it did not contain any unlawful material ’			2
investigated : @entity69 checked @entity75 's internet usage from the laptop and found nothing untoward but since the incident has gone public , @entity6 whips are doing their own internal investigation she said : ‘ they subsequently advised me the dvd contained hardcore pornography of the type you might be able to buy in this country , but more likely to buy abroad or over the internet , but that no criminal offence had been committed			1
’ although it was considered that mr @entity5 had breached council policy , the letter said the matter was not pursued because the dvd was watched in a private capacity			1
mrs @entity28 said of the porn film : ‘ our dvd player broke so we unfortunately used a county council laptop ( to watch it )			1
‘ we are a middle - aged couple who love each other as much as we did when we were in our 20s			0
‘ when you get to middle age , you need a bit of assistance			0
’ after the dvd was found five years ago , officers at council headquarters checked mr @entity5 ’s internet usage and found nothing untoward			1
however , miss @entity68 warned him not to view pornography on a county council computer again ‘ otherwise i have no alternative but to pursue the matter further ’			2
mr @entity5 yesterday said he had referred the incident to the @entity114 group on the council in order for whips to investigate , after he became aware the letter had been leaked			1
' error of judgement ' : @entity121 said he forgot to take the dvd out of the computer 's cd drive before handing it to council it workers for repair he has stepped down as deputy leader but will continue as a councillor while the investigation continues			1
the councillor , who represents @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 , said : ‘ most of the feedback i have had from people is that this is all a storm in a tea cup			2
‘ if this damages my chances of re-election then so be it but i am honest and straightforward and it is better to be open			0
i am just an ordinary guy who works hard for his patch and that is what i ’ll continue to do			0
’ @entity147 , the council leader , said that under new conservative group rules introduced following the resignation in july of his predecessor , @entity151 , members were required to either step down or be suspended while an investigation took place to ensure no breach of the party ’s rules had taken place			2
mr @entity147 said it was imperative the authority was ‘ seen to be acting in accordance with the highest standards of conduct ’ , adding that mr @entity5 had made the ‘ right decision , personally and in the interests of the council ’s reputation ’			1
mr @entity147 said he found it ‘ disappointing ’ that mr @entity151 did n’t ‘ deal with this matter properly through the group rules at the time ’			2
mr @entity151 resigned shortly after it emerged police had begun an investigation into his travel expense claims .			0
