by @entity0 @entity2 founder @entity1 , pictured , has invested in artificial intelligence firm @entity3 some of the most entrepreneurial minds in the world are joining forces to help a small tech startup create a digital brain			1
@entity2 founder @entity1 and @entity10 owner @entity9 join the likes of @entity13 billionaire @entity12 , actor @entity14 and @entity2 ’s co-founder @entity15 by investing in @entity16 - based @entity3			1
the startup wants to create software that ‘ thinks and learns like a human ’ , and to do that , the firm is attempting to build a program that mimics the brain ’s neocortex			1
according to reports in the @entity26 , @entity1 , @entity9 and @entity14 have invested a total of $ 40million ( £ 24million ) in the company			1
@entity12 reportedly invested $ 1.2 million ( £ 727,000 ) in 2010 , while @entity15 was said to have added $ 15million ( £ 9million ) to the fund			0
the neocortex is the top layer of the cerebral hemispheres in the brain of mammals			0
it is approximately 3mm thick and has six layers , each involved with various functions			0
these include sensory perception , spatial reasoning , conscious thought , and language in humans			2
according to the company ’s website : ‘ @entity3 is developing machine learning software based on the computational principles of the human brain			1
‘ our first technology is a visual perception system that interprets the contents of photographs and videos in a manner similar to humans			0
‘ powering this technology is a new computational paradigm we call the @entity60			0
’ the @entity16 - based startup wants to create software that ' thinks and learns like a human '			1
to do this the firm is attempting to build a program that mimics the brain 's neocortex , which is responsible for thought , spatial reasoning and language in humans			1

it is approximately 3mm thick and has six layers each involved with various functions			0
these include sensory perception , generation of motor commands , spatial reasoning , conscious thought , and in humans , language			2
@entity3 founder @entity95 told the @entity26 if the firm is successful with its current project , the company will have created ' a computer that thinks like a person except it does n't need to eat or sleep			2
' a @entity2 spokesperson said @entity1 ’s investment was ‘ personal ’ , and was not affiliated with the company			1
@entity12 said : ‘ @entity3 is bringing us all closer to a future where computers perceive , imagine , and reason just like humans			1
’ and @entity15 added : ‘ the technology that @entity3 is developing has the potential to improve all lives and revolutionise every industry			2
’ in october 2013 , the company announced it had developed an algorithm that ‘ reliably ’ solves modern @entity116 - the world ’s most widely used test of a machine ’s ability to act human			0
captchas are used when filling in forms , for example , to make sure it ’s not being completed by a bot			0
this prevents people programming computers to buy a bulk load of gig tickets , for example			0
a captcha scheme is considered broken if an algorithm is able to reach a precision of at least 1 per cent			0
by using research into so - called machine learning - in which a machine can learn from its mistakes - and neuroscience , the @entity3 artificial intelligence achieved success rates up to 90 per cent on modern captchas from @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity13 , @entity146 , and others			2
@entity149 founder @entity95 told the @entity26 if the firm is successful with its current project , @entity3 will have created ‘ a computer that thinks like a person except it does n't need to eat or sleep			0

@entity16 startup @entity3 is building software designed to mimic the *behaviour* of the brain 's neocortex
the neocortex is the part of the brain involved in thought and language
@entity3 wants to create a system ' that thinks and learns like a human ’
@entity1 and @entity10 ’s @entity9 are the *latest* *backers*
others include @entity13 billionaire @entity12 and actor @entity14
