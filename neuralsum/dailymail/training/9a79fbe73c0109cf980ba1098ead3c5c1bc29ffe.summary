by @entity0 published : 03:40 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 10:22 est , 31 january 2014 the @entity3 nuclear reprocessing plant in @entity4 has been given the all - clear after an investigation into higher - than - normal radiation readings detected at a perimeter fence			1
the monitoring system picked up ' elevated ' levels of radioactivity overnight , leading to workers and contractors being told to stay away			1
but following an analysis by safety staff , @entity3 said the levels were ' naturally occurring background radon '			1
a statement said : ' @entity27 can confirm that the radioactivity detected by one of our in - air monitors overnight is not attributable to any issue or problem with any of our operations on site			1
' our in - air monitors are extremely sensitive and pick up on any abnormality			0
overnight the monitoring system initially indicated elevated levels of activity			1
following investigation and analysis , we can now confirm these levels to be naturally occurring background radon			1
' the number one priority for us is , at all times , safe secure stewardship of the @entity3 site , which is the most complex and challenging nuclear site in @entity52			1
' as such we act in a safety conscious manner , and take cautious , conservative decisions , such as the one taken overnight to ask non-safety essential staff to stay at home this morning , rather than come to the site			1
message : staff were told to stay away from the site in rural @entity4 unless ' requested to attend ' work ' all of our plants and storage facilities were quickly confirmed as operating normally , and we were always confident that the issue posed no risk to the workforce or public because the levels being detected , whilst above background radiation levels , were still low			1
' this view was reinforced by the fact that none of our other installed monitors were picking up any kind of increased levels			2
however , we take such issues so seriously that we investigated fully to confirm that everything was okay			0
' standard weekend working operations will continue , with day staff due back in on monday as normal			2
' we would like to thank our staff and the wider @entity83 community for their calm and mature response to events this morning			2
' the @entity88 union , which represents 5,000 nuclear specialists at @entity3 , said the elevated radiation readings were within acceptable limits and were not a danger to human health or to the plant			1
national officer @entity95 said : ' higher than normal radiation readings have been detected at one monitor at a perimeter fence			2
as a precaution , non-essential staff have been advised to stay at home today while the relevant specialist team investigates			1
' the company 's decision to partially close some areas at the site is a precautionary and measured decision and a safety measure that is recognised worldwide			2
' remote : @entity3 site is built close to the village of @entity110 on the @entity83 coast facing the @entity112 controls : workers in protective overalls in 1957 after the @entity118 - @entity117 's worst nuclear disaster @entity3 was the world ’s first commercial nuclear station , and has suffered 21 ' leaks ' in 60 years			1
the giant facility opened under the name of @entity3 to produce plutonium for @entity117 ’s h - bomb			1
in 1957 , a fire broke out in no 1 of the twin ‘ piles ’ or reactors , which became the worst nuclear disaster in @entity117 history			0
it was only discovered 50 hours later , and took three days to bring under control			0
the blaze was caused by heat building up in the reactor after a series of safety blunders			0
as the fire raged , workers at the plant used hoses to try to cool the reactor			0
however , contaminated air escaped through the 400ft - high chimney and rose over the @entity145 in a long grey plume			2
eventually , radioactive particles fell on to the local countryside or were caught in a changing wind , which blew them further inland towards @entity151 and over the sea to @entity153			0
in 1982 , the @entity154 issued a report estimating that 32 deaths and at least 260 cases of cancer could be attributed to the fire			0
but there are widespread concerns that this figure was much too low			0
there have also been several other leaks			0
in 1983 there was a notorious ' discharge incidents ' where radioactive material was leaked , shutting a 10 - mile stretch of beach and sea			0
in 2005 it emerged there was waste leaking from a cracked chamber , which may have been undiscovered for eight months			0
bosses have been fined heavily after the incidents			0
it is also claimed by groups like @entity179 that various leaks while it was being built means that the @entity112 is one of the most contaminated stretches of water in the world because waste was diluted and dumped into it .			0

all non-essential staff have been warned to stay away from @entity4 site
@entity3 says high radiation levels occurred ' naturally ' in north of site
