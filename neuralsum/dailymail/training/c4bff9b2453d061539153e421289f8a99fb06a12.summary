@entity0 have returned to @entity2 's elite competition for the first time in five years and their @entity5 comeback means the youth team can get involved in the fun too			1
if you 've not come across it by now , the @entity8 is an under 19 competition that runs parallel to the main show			0
and @entity0 's maiden appearance in the tournament was a big success as their academy side defeated @entity16 4 - 0 on tuesday afternoon			1
the star of the show at @entity18 in @entity19 was forward @entity20 , who notched two goals in the comprehensive win			0
but who is the hotshot tipped for a big future at @entity26 ? @entity27 has everything you need to know			1
@entity20 scored twice as @entity0 's @entity30 beat @entity16 in the @entity8 name : @entity20 age : 17 club : @entity0 position : striker i 'm going to need more than that ... in contrast to the senior side , who needed a stoppage time penalty to overcome @entity16 at @entity26 later in the day , @entity0 's youngsters were far too powerful for their @entity44 opponents			1
they ran the show from first whistle to last in the @entity19 sunshine and the chances and goals flowed at frequent intervals			0
if they had sustained the free - flowing football of the first - half , in which they scored three times , this could have been a victory for the record books			0
but in the end , four goals was more than sufficient , with @entity20 very happy with his match - defining double			2
his first , on the half - hour mark , was an accomplished finish after left - back @entity64 had split the @entity16 back line with a surging run from deep			0
@entity20 is congratulated by team - mate @entity64 after scoring @entity0 's opening goal against @entity69 @entity20 showing his pace and acceleration during a @entity73 tie at @entity74 in december 2013 his second , three minutes from time , was a straightforward piece of opportunism , pouncing to score on the rebound after @entity80 's free - kick had rebounded off the post			1
these were just two examples of the many types of goal @entity20 is capable of and a small glimpse into the buzz around a 17 - year - old coaches at @entity26 believe can become the next @entity88			1
@entity20 already holds the distinction of being the youngest player to turn out for @entity0 , making his senior debut with a nine - minute cameo in a @entity94 tie at @entity95 in september 2012			1
he was a tender 16 years and six days old			1
why all the fuss ? well , although that remains @entity20 's one and only senior outing , he has been making great strides at youth team and under 21 level			2
born in @entity103 in september 1996 , @entity20 was a member of the @entity95 academy between the ages of 10 and 14 before being spotted by @entity0			1
he spent the 2011 - 2012 campaign mainly with the under 16 side but made a handful of appearances for the under 18 team towards the end			0
@entity20 gets the better of @entity113 's @entity112 in an under 18 @entity115 fixture @entity20 takes on @entity116 of @entity117 in the 2013 @entity73 semi-final , second leg at @entity120 his coach @entity121 was impressed by his talent and a 15 - year - old @entity20 was even invited to rub shoulders with the likes of @entity125 and @entity126 at @entity127 , something he later described as a ' great learning curve			1
' it was n't long before @entity20 found his scoring boots , with a prolific pre-season in 2012 leading to a call up into the squad @entity135 was about to lead into the @entity136			0
@entity20 impressed in the first group match away to @entity138 , winning a penalty that @entity140 converted and going close himself on a number of occasions			0
@entity0 were narrowly beaten 3 - 2 in that game but went on to advance from the group , @entity20 scoring his first goal in continental competition in a 4 - 1 win over @entity148			1
@entity20 shifts the ball to try and get past @entity113 defender @entity150 in an under 18 fixture these appearances came either side of that first team run - out at @entity155 , a moment @entity20 described as a ' dream come true ' in a later interview			2
@entity20 has since represented the club 's under 18 team and also made three appearances for the @entity161 at the tail end of last season			2
his double against @entity16 will only enhance his reputation , with group matches against @entity167 and @entity168 to come			0
what about international recognition ? @entity20 has represented @entity170 at @entity171 and under 17 level			0
his debut came in the @entity174 in october 2011 , when @entity175 were beaten 4 - 0			1
his first goals for the @entity170 came at the @entity177 in @entity178 , helping to secure wins against the hosts and also @entity181			0
@entity20 in @entity170 colours breaking through the @entity184 defence in an under 17 international in august 2012 what are his strengths ? as shown in the @entity8 , @entity20 is already a good finisher and has a knack of getting into the right place at the right time to gobble up loose balls			2
he seems strong on both feet when in and around the penalty area and has good placement			0
at 5ft 8in , @entity20 wo n't win a great deal in their air but he has tricky feet and good acceleration too , so he fits in with the fluid passing game the @entity0 academy try to foster			2
what happens next ? @entity20 can really make a name for himself in the @entity8 , especially if he performs in the matches against real @entity167 , which will enjoy a raised profile			2
he will continue to get opportunities for the under 21 team and has plenty of time on his side to mature and develop in this age bracket			0
though unlikely to break into the first team just yet , he is well on the way to realising his abundant potential			0
@entity20 gets a hug from @entity214 during the 4 - 0 rout of @entity16			1

@entity20 scored two as @entity0 beat @entity16 4 - 0 in their @entity8 opener on tuesday
17 - year - old striker is tipped for a big future at @entity26
coaching staff compare his abilities to @entity88
@entity20 was @entity0 's youngest ever first team player at 16 years and 6 days when he played against @entity95 in @entity94
