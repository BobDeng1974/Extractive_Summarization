@entity0 never told the @entity2 people the truth about his son @entity4 a @entity6 archive has yielded up one of the last secrets of @entity9 that dictator @entity0 took to his grave - the fact his son @entity4 gave himself up to @entity12 forces during the 1941 invasion of his country			1
the party line in @entity0 ’s @entity2 was always that @entity4 , the eldest son of the murderous @entity17 tyrant , was captured			1
now a file of the @entity19 suggests that he gave himself up because of his disillusionment with the conduct of the war which saw 1.3 million @entity24 men captured , killed or disabled in the first weeks of the @entity12 invasion in june 1941			2
@entity26 has accessed the files and prints the story of @entity0 ’s son , known as @entity30 , in its latest edition			1
@entity0 disowned him in 1928 following a dispute about a girl and the defence ministry archive in @entity37 reveals @entity0 writing to his mother in april 1928 : ' @entity39 that i think he behaved like a thug and an extortionist , someone with whom i no longer have anything in common and with whom i no longer want a relationship			1
let him live where and with whom he wants			0
' @entity4 volunteered for the army in 1937 , became a lieutenant in 1940 and was a commander in the 14th @entity54 of the 14th @entity55 at the time @entity56 unleashed three million men in @entity58 on june 22 1941			1
by july 9 @entity6 forces were in retreat from @entity61 in what is now @entity63 and @entity4 ’s battery was ordered to give covering fire			0
he was recommended for a medal by his commanding officer for bravery , but he vanished - presumed captured			0
the division sent a unit to the area where he went missing , the papers say , and the men came across @entity24 soldier @entity74 , ' who had managed to escape with @entity4			0
he said they buried their papers together and put on civilian clothing			1
when they reached the lakeside , comrade @entity4 told @entity82 to keep going , but that he wanted to stay and rest			2
' doting father : @entity0 , pictured with his daughter @entity84 , disowned his son @entity4 in 1928 @entity0 's son @entity4 deserted the army and had described it as being ' poorly organised ' and ill prepared for war ' the episode suggests that @entity4 had allowed himself to be taken prisoner , ' said @entity91 , and @entity0 seemingly concurred , which explains why the archive was also sealed for so long			1
@entity0 never told the @entity2 people - 27 million of whom were to die fighting the @entity95 - that his son was captured			2
in his eyes this was treason , and hundreds of thousands of @entity2 who returned from @entity12 captivity marched straight into the @entity102 prison gulag for 25 year stretches for their ' crime			0
' also hidden in the archive were @entity4 ’s equally treasonous statements that were found in @entity106 after the war in which he poured scorn on the @entity24 his own father commanded			2
of the leadership he stated : ' when they were surrounded , they went into such a panic that everyone scattered in different directions … we had no maps at all			0
in our unit , everything was slovenly and poorly organized … the division was n’t prepared for the war at all … ' marshal @entity122 , who would go on to capture @entity106 in 1945 , recalled in his memoirs a conversation he had with ‘ the chief ’ during the war in which @entity0 said : ' @entity4 will not escape captivity			1
the fascists will shoot him			0
' this proved to be true : in april 1943 he was shot while trying to escape from the @entity132 concentration camp north of @entity106 .			0
