financial problems plaguing @entity2 and its casino empire in @entity4 have the company considering a trip to bankruptcy court , possibly as early as thursday			1

@entity30 casino - hotel companies are dependent on extra cash in a person 's pocket , but perhaps none more than @entity2 , which waded into the recent economic downturn already burdened by more debt than any of them - a by - product of a buyout in january 2008 that was largely a wager using other people 's money			1
while competitors found fortune in @entity44 's casino growth as stateside gambling in @entity4 and @entity46 waned , @entity2 missed out			1
and as other companies built arenas and shopping districts on the @entity4 or casino - hotels in newer gambling markets across the country , analysts say @entity54 was reluctant to spend			0
it went private , then public again to raise cash and created new related companies , shifting its properties from one to another to free them up from the debt cordoned off in one spot , its @entity56 that 's the company now headed to bankruptcy court			1
regardless of the maneuvers , ' the fundamentals were not there to support the amount of debt that they had , ' said @entity69 , an analyst with @entity70			0
@entity73 and @entity74 did what a lot of private equity firms were doing at the time when money and loans were easy to come by , buying companies with promise — relying mostly on debt — to add to its portfolio			0
the gambling industry looked promising			0
the deal to buy @entity2 ( then known as @entity2 's ) was first announced in 2006 during the heyday of vegas tourism and development			1
but the deal did n't close until january 2008 , several months before @entity87 would go bankrupt , shaking the economy to its core			0
and it was a nearly $ 30 billion deal with the two firms taking on more than $ 10 billion of existing debt and relying on several billion more in bonds to pay for the company			1
the fountain in front of @entity19 hotel and casino in @entity4 is part of the group 's lavish design in between , the company had cut about 200 people from its corporate staff			2
before the year was done , @entity2 was cutting more staff and looking for new cash to make its interest payments			1

the company faces irked creditors , a few who have tried to force the casino giant into bankruptcy against its will this week			2
