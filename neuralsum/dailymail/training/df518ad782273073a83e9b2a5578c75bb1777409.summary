speaking to reporters in @entity19 , where he and @entity20 were reunited earlier this week , @entity6 said he was horrified by the @entity22 's decision to reopen the case into the murder of @entity26 student @entity13			1
@entity6 and @entity20 were found guilty of murdering 21 - year - old miss @entity27 in 2009 and were jailed for 25 and 26 years respectively			1
they were freed on appeal in 2011 , but @entity10 judges have now ordered them to return to court for retrial			1
@entity6 told @entity34 : ' @entity35 was like being hit by a thunderbolt			1
our relationship got very intense , very quickly			2
' i did n't have much experience of sex			0
she had a bit more than me			0
we were sleeping together and our sex life was n't boring			0
' we talked about fantasies and asked each other what we liked and so on , but it was totally normal			0
' @entity6 said he felt great sorrow over the death of miss @entity27 and added that he would one day like to visit her grave in @entity53 , @entity54			1
he said : ' i will never forget @entity13			1
it was terrible what happened			0
but i am not responsible for her death			0
' it makes me sad when her family say they still believe other people were involved			0
@entity13 is in prison for her murder and his dna was all over the scene			2
' he described the reopening of the trial as like a ' horror movie where they keep making sequels ' , and continues to deny having anything to do with miss @entity27 's death			1
the court ruled that the 21 - year - old 's death was a ' sex game gone wrong ' and have ordered @entity6 and @entity20 back for trial			1
this has resulted in @entity6 launching a desperate $ 500,000 ( £ 320,000 ) online appeal for donations to fund his retrial			1
the computer studies graduate said he was hard up and needed the cash for ' legal expenses ' but added he would donate anything raised above the target ' to a research foundation '			0
in an appeal posted on his @entity94 page , @entity6 wrote : ' well guys , the problem for me now is pretty though			1
close : @entity8 and @entity6 are pictured outside the rented house shortly after miss @entity27 was found dead ' i 'm deeply concerned not just for the issue i 'm facing and most of you already know about , but also because i do n't have resources anymore to fight this injustice			2
' i badly need to be able to hire experts , when needed , or pay my attorney fees , documents fees , and so on when the new appeal will start			2
' i hope to not bother you , but i need your collaboration to face this ordeal			0
otherwise i do n't want to forced to give up just for financial reason			0
' i hope you will understand			0
i 'm just asking if you , buddies , know how to build up a non-profit raising funds foundation			0
' accused : @entity8 and @entity6 have been ordered to return to court for a retrial for the murder of @entity26 student @entity13 , pictured @entity6 is thought to have been paid $ 1million ( £ 650,000 ) for @entity118 tv news interviews and an advance on his book @entity121 : my journey to @entity123 with @entity8 , which was published last year			1
however a sizeable proportion of that was swallowed up in legal fees to his team of lawyers including @entity10 's high flying @entity130 who is said to have the highest fees in the country			2
on tuesday , the @entity133 issued its written reasoning for doing so			0
miss @entity27 's body was found in november 2007 in her bedroom of the house she shared with @entity20 in @entity138 , a central @entity10 town popular with foreign exchange students			1
@entity20 , now 25 , and her @entity10 ex-boyfriend , @entity6 , 29 , were initially convicted and sentenced to long prison terms , but a @entity138 appeals court acquitted them in 2011 , criticising virtually the entire case mounted by prosecutors			1
the appellate court noted that the murder weapon was never found , said that dna tests were faulty and that prosecutors provided no murder motive			0
a young man from @entity152 , @entity13 , was convicted of the slaying in a separate proceeding and is serving a 16 - year sentence			2
in the 74 - page cassation ruling , the @entity133 judges said they ' had to recognize that he ( @entity159 ) was not the sole author ' of the crime , @entity10 news agency @entity162 reported			0
the judges though said he was the ' main protagonist '			0
they said the new appeal process would serve to ' not only demonstrate the presence of the two suspects in the place of the crime , but to possibly outline the subjective position of @entity159 's accomplices '			2
it said hypotheses ran from a simple case of forced sex involving @entity27 ' to a group erotic game that blew up and got out of control '			2
crime scene : this is the flat in @entity138 where @entity13 was found dead decision : @entity10 's judges have ruled that the possibility that @entity13 died during a sex game which went wrong needed to be looked at again the high court faulted the @entity138 appeals court for ' multiple instances of deficiencies , contradictions and illogical ' conclusions			1
the new court must conduct a full examination of evidence to resolve the ambiguities , it said			0
@entity20 and @entity6 denied wrongdoing and said they were n't even in the apartment that night , although they acknowledged they had smoked marijuana and their memories were clouded			1
miss @entity27 was found semi-naked and with her throat cut in the bedroom of the house she shared in the @entity10 hilltop town of @entity138 with his @entity118 former girlfriend			0
he was given a 25 - year jail term while @entity20 was given 26 years but in 2011 the verdicts were overturned and they were released on appeal			1
however , three months ago @entity10 's highest court ruled there should be a fresh trial for both of them .			2

@entity6 has described *re-opening* of case as like a ' horror movie '
he said he would like one day to visit @entity13 's grave
earlier this week he was reunited with @entity20 in @entity19
he has launched $ 500,000 appeal for donations to fund retrial
