by @entity0 published : 06:56 est , 17 september 2012 updated : 12:34 est , 17 september 2012 a police officer told today how a shark guided him to a rescue boat after he had drifted helplessly in the @entity4 for 15 weeks			1
mr @entity6 ’s brother - in - law had perished from dehydration and the 41 - year - old policeman knew it was only a matter of time before he , too , succumbed to the elements			1
but he said today that two unexpected events led to his eventual rescue – a tropical downpour that provided him with drinking water and the extraordinary encounter with the shark			2
trouble in paradise : mr @entity6 and his brother - in - law were travelling from the @entity20 capital to their home on a nearby atoll when their boat went adrift ‘ just as i was giving up all hope of being rescued after one boat had passed me by in the distance something very strange happened , ’ mr @entity6 said after being brought ashore in the @entity26 by the fishing boat which found him			1
‘ i was cowering from the sun under a piece of cloth i had stretched across the front of the boat when i felt a big bump , followed by some scratching			2
‘ i looked over the side and saw a six - foot shark circling my boat , but it was mainly bumping against the hull			2
‘ it definitely caught my attention because i had been fast asleep			0
then , because i was now awake , i looked around me and saw the stern of a ship			0
‘ i could n’t believe my eyes			0
i could just make out the crew who were looking at me through binoculars			0
shark rescue : mr @entity6 say he was saved by a shark who alerted him to a nearby rescue boat by bumping into his vessel when he had fallen asleep ‘ of course i was able to wave frantically at them and they came and picked me up			1
if that shark had n’t nudged me awake the crew of the boat might have thought i was n’t in trouble and might have carried on sailing past me			2
’ mr @entity6 told his extraordinary story after being treated for exhaustion and dehydration in @entity60 in the @entity26			1
he and his brother - in - law had flown from their home on the island of @entity65 to the @entity67 capital of @entity68 so that mr @entity6 could be sworn in as a policeman			1
by a curious coincidence , following the swearing - in ceremony , he watched a film depicting a true story about four men from @entity67 who had been lost at sea , with only two surviving after they were washed ashore in @entity76 six weeks later			1
when it was time for mr @entity79 and his brother - in - law , @entity81 , 52 , to return to their home they boarded a 15ft wooden boat for what should have been a two hour voyage			1
they stopped to fish along the way and then dozed off – and when they awoke they found they had drifted out of sight of @entity65			0
soon afterwards , they ran out of fuel			0
‘ we had plenty of food and we could catch fish , but the problem was there was nothing to drink , ’ said mr @entity79			2
as the two men began to suffer from dehydration , mr @entity6 turned to prayer , but his brother - in - law just lay in the boat			1
after five weeks adrift , mr @entity81 died			0
' i left him there overnight and slept next to him , like at a funeral , ' said mr @entity6			1
in the morning , he lowered the body of his brother - in - law over the side			1
just 24 hours later , life - giving rains fell during a storm – rains that fell for several days – and mr @entity79 was able to fill two five gallon containers of water			2
' there were two choices in my mind at the time			0
either someone would find me or i would follow my brother - in - law in death			1
i was running out of water			0
it was out of my control , ' he said			0
he prayed every morning and several weeks later he caught sight of a fishing boat , but the crew failed to see him			0
so he continued praying , drinking water and eating raw fish he was able to catch , doing his best to keep out of the tropical sun by sleeping under the cloth awning he had erected			0
weeks went by – and then came that bump			0
the bump of a shark which woke him and alerted him to a boat that was close enough to see his frantic waving for help			2
shortly before leaving @entity60 today , mr @entity6 said : ‘ i ’m flying home			1
i ’ll never go by boat again			0

@entity6 *'s* brother - in - law perished at sea near @entity67
mr @entity6 was sleeping when the shark bumped into his boat , alerting him of a nearby vessel
