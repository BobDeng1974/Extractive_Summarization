' @entity4 ' reached speeds of up to 834 mph before his parachute opened and he landed back on solid ground five minutes later to have completed the highest and fastest skydive in history , one year ago yesterday			1
to celebrate the anniversary of the incredible feat , @entity14 has released a video showing multiple views of the jump all at once , including data that lends some perspective to just how fast mr @entity4 was plummeting towards our planet			1
mr @entity4 made his death - defying jump from a tiny capsule that took him up to the edge of space , which took him two - and - a - half hours to travel 128,177ft above the @entity46 desert - and less than ten minutes to land			1
he landed on his feet despite moments during the descent that had silenced his mission control as he appeared to lose control and plunge into a head - over - heels spin			2
people across the world watched in awe and horror as dare devil @entity4 became the first freefall diver to break the sound barrier after jumping from a balloon 24.5 miles above the @entity8 the video of the @entity63 jump , pictured , contains data about the skydive including air speed , g - force , altitude and heart rate people who watched footage of the jump last year will remember how the daredevil fell to his knees and punched the air in triumph as the control room , packed with scientific experts and family including his teary - eyed mother , @entity80 , erupted into roars of applause			1
speaking afterwards he said : ' trust me , when you stand up there on top of the world , you become so humble			0
' it 's not about breaking records any more			0
it 's not about getting scientific data			0
the only thing you want is to come back alive			0
' during the first part of mr @entity4 's free fall , anxious onlookers at the command centre held their breath as he appeared to spin uncontrollably			2
' when i was spinning the first 10 , 20 seconds , i never thought i was going to lose my life but i was disappointed because i 'm going to lose my record			0
i put seven years of my life into this , ' he said			0

it 's not about breaking records any more			0
it 's not about getting scientific data			0
the only thing you want is to come back alive ' mr @entity4 said his @entity33 jump has proved that a human can survive accelerating though the sound barrier in freefall and scientists gathered a lot of information , including the first - ever physiologic data from a peron freefalling at supersonic speeds that could be used to inform future projects he added : ' in that situation , when you spin around , it 's like hell and you do n't know if you can get out of that spin or not			1
of course it was terrifying			0
i was fighting all the way down because i knew that there must be a moment where i can handle it			0
' @entity14 , which sponsored the jump , has also made a new documentary called @entity136 , to celebrate the anniversary , which is available here			1
mr @entity4 has revealed this week that he was inspired to do the challenge after watching @entity141 's 19 mile high jump that took place in 1960			2
his idol is now mr @entity4 's mentor and friend and he told @entity14 : ' the fact that he [ mr @entity141 ] survived opened the door to space exploration , because it proved a pressure suit could protect a person in that hostile environment			1
' pilot mr @entity4 ( pictured after his jump ) said his next challenge is more personal in nature as he would like to pilot mountain rescue and help to fight wildfires by flying helicopters - completing his other childhood dream mr @entity4 said his @entity33 jump has proved that a human can survive accelerating though the sound barrier in freefall and scientists gathered a lot of information , including the first - ever physiologic data from a peron freefalling at supersonic speeds that could be used to inform future projects			1
' it 's incredibly useful for those who are exploring how people might be able to bail out of aircraft at ultra-high altitudes , ' he said			1
mr @entity4 said his next challenge is more personal in nature as he would like to pilot mountain rescue and help to fight wildfires by flying helicopters - completing his other childhood dream			2
he said : i think future adventures are for the next generation to envision ; but people are definitely looking toward new horizons in space			2
that ’s why government and private aerospace organizations have been interested in the mission data we ’ve been sharing			0
they can build on what we learned for future exploration			0

@entity4 became the first freefall diver to break the sound barrier after jumping from a balloon 24.5 miles above the @entity8 last year
@entity14 has released a video that shows real - time speed , g - force , altitude and heart rate readings as well as *simultaneous* views of the jump
the daredevil said the readings could help people who are exploring how pilots might be able to bail out of aircraft at ultra-high altitudes
