from a lunar base to alien spaceships , the dark secrets hidden in the moon 's surface have long been a source of fascination for conspiracy theorists			1
now one @entity9 user believes he has made the ultimate find on images from @entity12 - an alien figure lurking in the satellite ’s deep craters			1
@entity16 's video shows what he says could be an alien figure walking along the surface and it has already been viewed more than two million times in less than a month			1
however , the most likely explanation for the sighting is a psychological phenomenon called @entity24 , which is the brain 's response to seeing faces and other significant objects in random stimulus			1
@entity37 announced the shape is simply ' dust , an eyelash [ or ] scratch on the negative ' of the film that took the image seeing familiar things in random objects is nothing new			1
the phenomenon is called @entity24 is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus			1
it is a form of @entity52 , which is when people see patterns or connections in random , unconnected data			2
human eyes can spot faces within their environment and it helps them recognise friends in a crowd , work out how fast a car is travelling , and see patterns			2
scientists claim we also tend to use this ability to ' enrich our imagination ' and recognise meaningful shapes , even when they 're not there			1
the strange shape can also be seen on @entity12 at 27 ° 34 ’ 26.35 ″ n 19 ° 36 ’ 4.75 ″ @entity71 @entity72 , a paranormal explainer , wrote in the examiner the figure bears an uncanny resemblance to what the ancient statue , ' @entity76 ' , is thought to have looked like before it was felled a massive earthquake in 226 bc. @entity16 said he started investigating the shadow after receiving an online tip from another web user named @entity35			1
‘ an irregularly shaped dark spot he noticed on @entity12 looks like it could be a cast shadow from a massive standing object , or figure , ’ @entity82 told @entity83			1
‘ at first i thought maybe it was something drawn into the picture but after going to @entity12 , whatever it is or is n't … uh , is there			1
’ the images used to create the lunar images for @entity96 's moon series come from @entity37			1
however , the space agency has yet to comment on exactly what they believe the image shows			0
' an irregularly shaped dark spot he noticed on @entity12 looks like it could be a cast shadow from a massive standing object , or figure , ' @entity82 told @entity83 this is n’t the first time that @entity16 has spotted strange objects after ploughing through @entity96 ’s moon series			1
in january , the user highlighted controversial images which showed what some people believed could be a secret alien base or spaceship on the moon			1
the triangular anomaly , spotted on @entity96 's map of the moon , had rows of seven light - like dots along its edge			2
@entity72 , a paranormal explainer , wrote in the examiner that the figure bears an uncanny resemblance to what the ancient statue , ' @entity76 ' , is thought to have looked like before it was felled a massive earthquake in 226 bc ' is it just a weird looking crater ? or is it something else ? , ' he asked			2
' it is really there , not faked and i have no clue what it is			0
i found nothing else like it in any of the other craters			0
' according to website tech and @entity138 : ' the gigantic shape actually looks like the leading edge of an immense , triangular space ship , similar to , so far , super secret stealth aircraft technology , but is much larger than any airplane ever built on @entity144			0
' the regularly spaced , circular promontory shapes which make up the seven points on the perfectly formed triangle wedge seem to be intelligently designed			2
this triangular anomaly with rows of seven light - like dots along its edge has been tracked down on the @entity12 viewer the two - sided , triangular feature on the lunar surface , was uncovered paranormal researcher @entity156			2
it can be found on the @entity12 viewer at coordinates 22042 ' @entity160 and 142034 ' @entity161 @entity12 works in a similar way to @entity144			2
it was launched in 2009 on the 40th anniversary of the @entity165 lunar landing			0
the landing site of each of the @entity169 missions is shown on the satellite image , providing more information on each mission as the user zooms in			2
the first version of @entity12 only included low - resolution satellite imagery of the entire moon , and when zoomed in too close , a @entity178 cheese pattern would appear			1
' to date , no other feature has ever been discovered which matches this shape on the moon , or any other planet observed by satellite or exploratory rover			0
' the anomaly is so huge , it 's possible it is some sort of moon base used as a facility for storing and launching alien @entity83 spacecraft			2
' the same @entity9 user also claims to have found a similar mystery structure on @entity144 , nestled under the ice in @entity193			1
' it is also a triangular shape , measuring 125 by 90mtres			0
' it is unique in the area , ' he said			0
tricks of light in space photography have led to a number of excited reports about alien life in our solar system			0
in november , paranormal researchers found what they believed to be evidence of a fossilised iguana on the surface of @entity212			0
the mysterious object was spotted by @entity214 who uncovered the photograph in @entity37 ’s archives			0
earlier this week a ' human face ' was pointed out by the @entity220 's youth portal , @entity219 , on the @entity223 's comet @entity221 ‘ this is not the first animal found on @entity212 , actually there have been about 10 - 15 to date , ’ mr @entity224 told news site agoracosmopolitan.com			0
‘ i even found a rock that moved four times in four photos ... then vanished on the fifth			0
