@entity0 says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of @entity4 with thousands of supporters planning to boycott sunday 's home match against @entity7			1
the 50 - year - old has found himself the target of angry fans who are disillusioned with @entity12 ’s running of the club			1
results on the pitch – they have lost five on the spin - have not helped @entity0 ’s cause , but the problems at @entity4 run deeper than a boss who has been left with a depleted and disinterested playing squad			1
@entity0 says he has the hardest job in football as head coach of @entity4 @entity4 ’s supporters will protest at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition from billionaire @entity12 , especially as the @entity29 have returned record profits of £ 18.7million and this week revealed they also have £ 34m sat in a bank account			1
@entity0 is the only public face of the club and is forced to answer – or deflect – questions about the hierarchy on a weekly basis , distracting from what is a difficult task in charge of a squad in desperate need of overhaul			1
but as reported by @entity45 last month , senior sources within @entity43 have indicated that @entity47 boss @entity46 will take over in the summer , regardless of whether or not the @entity48 are promoted from the @entity49			2
on @entity50 , however , he will inherit what @entity0 believes is the toughest task in the land : ‘ i think it is the hardest job in football , definitely , ’ he said			2
@entity46 has already been tipped as a replacement for @entity0 should he face the @entity4 axe ‘ for me , this is the dream job , but you love it and hate it at the same time			1
‘ the hardest thing is taking the criticism off your own people			2
some of it is deserved and some of it is not			2
‘ sometimes you ’re dealt the hand and you ’ve got to get on with it and this is the hand i ’ve been dealt			0
‘ when i took it on , if i had n’t accepted then i would have been kicking myself			0
‘ and i ’ve said this before , i genuinely believe that if i ’ve got the right tools i can do the job			0
‘ but it is bitter sweet at the moment			0
this job is definitely a rollercoaster			0
’ @entity76 are co-ordinating sunday 's planned boycott			2
they will protest outside of the @entity79 before kick - off and after the game			0
during the match they will go to @entity84 behind the stadium			0
@entity0 , though , has urged fans to get behind the team			1
fans are unhappy at how @entity4 are being run under @entity12 and have planned a boycott ‘ i would go to the match because i support the team , ’ said @entity0 when asked if he would stay away as a supporter			1
‘ i think they ( boycotters ) do support the team but they have obviously got their own issues			0
‘ i never thought i 'd see this to be perfectly honest , especially in the @entity98 of @entity99 because we love football			0
‘ so obviously something has triggered in their heads to make them not want to come , and i respect that			0
’ @entity0 has urged the fans to get behind the squad ahead of their match against @entity7			1

his depleted and disinterested squad have lost five games in *succession*
supporter sites have *organised* a boycott of the clash with @entity7
