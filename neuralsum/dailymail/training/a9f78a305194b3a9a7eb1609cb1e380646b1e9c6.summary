tiny human hearts that beat of their own accord are being grown by scientists at @entity4 in @entity5			1
they have been developed specifically to find a cure for heart hypertrophy - a form of heart disease that can lead to sudden death			1
made from stem cells , the miniature hearts are just 0.04 inches ( one millimetre ) in diameter and contract at around 30 beats per minute			1
they have been developed specifically to find a cure for heart hypertrophy - a form of heart disease that enlarges the organ and can lead to sudden death although healthy to begin with , the scientists are using chemicals to simulate the physiological conditions that will make them become hypertrophic - enlarged - due to abnormal growth of the cells that make up the heart			1
in april scientists discovered a way to block the formation of excess cholesterol that leads to heart disease			1
working with mice and rabbits , @entity38 scientists successfully prevented the development of atherosclerosis , the main cause of heart attacks and strokes and the number - one cause of death among humans			2
the condition develops when fat builds inside blood vessels over time and renders them stiff , narrowed and hardened , greatly reducing their ability to feed oxygen - rich blood to the heart muscle and the brain			0
once diseased , the hearts are then treated with newly developed medications to see if they can prevent the damage from occurring			1
‘ although human hearts have been grown in labs before , this is the first time it has ever been possible to induce disease in them , ' said professor @entity68 , who is leading the research			1
‘ @entity71 hypertrophy can be hereditary , can be caused by diseases such as diabetes , or can be caused by doing too much strenuous exercise			0
‘ the disease causes the heart muscle to thicken and stiffen , and makes it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body			0
‘ in some people , a life - threatening abnormal heart rhythm will develop , and this is the most common cause of sudden death in young people			2
‘ although there are treatments , these only help to control the symptoms , and there is no known cure at the moment			0
’ made from stem cells , the miniature hearts are just 0.04 inches ( one millimetre ) in diameter and contract at around 30 beats per minute			1
pictured here are miniature hearts ' in vitro ' , which means they are studied with cells of biological molecules outside their normal biological context however , the miniature hearts being grown in professor @entity68 ’s lab could help change that			1
using biosensors , professor @entity68 was able to label specific molecules within the miniature hearts to see how the research should be led			2
by establishing which molecules cause the hearts to become hypertrophic , he has been able to target drugs at these molecules and prevent them from going down the path they would usually take - and prevent them from becoming hypertrophic			0
he added : ‘ we ’ve tested a number of different compounds on these hearts - some of them entirely new ones that have n’t been tested in humans yet , which is why we ’re testing them on these hearts we ’ve grown in the lab. ‘ one of these compounds , however , is a drug that we have developed which has just completed phase - two clinical trials in cancer patients and has had very positive results			2
‘ although heart cells are the only ones in the body that will never get cancer , we noticed that the pathways the molecules in hypertrophic hearts follow are similar to those followed by molecules in cancerous cells , so we thought testing this new drug on these hearts might have the same positive effect			0
' and , said professor @entity68 , this has proved to be the case			0
although healthy to begin with , the scientists are using chemicals to simulate the physiological conditions that will make hearts enlarged due to abnormal growth of the cells			1
pictured here are cariomyocytes , muscle cells , in the tiny hearts ‘ some of the compounds we ’ve tested have had undesirable effects , ' he continued , ' such as increasing the number of beats the hearts do per minute and making them stop beating			0
' but he explained that other compounds , such as a new cancer drug in development , managed to protect the hearts and prevent them from becoming enlarged			0
‘ we are still testing new drugs using this system to find new compounds with better efficiency and fewer side - effects , ' he said			0
‘ once we know exactly which compounds work and which do n’t we ’ll begin developing new drugs which will then undergo further tests , before eventually being trialled in humans			0
‘ although there is still a long way to go before the drugs become available commercially , we are extremely hopeful that we will one day be able to stop heart hypertrophy from developing in those at risk of the disease			2
