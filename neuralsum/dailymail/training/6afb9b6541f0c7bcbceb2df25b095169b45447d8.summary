unstable weather and dangerous conditions caused by an @entity3 cold front hitting warm tropical air 2,500kms off @entity6 's west coast is expected to severely affect the search for @entity8 over the coming weeks and months			1
an aviation meteorologist and an air and sea consultant have both predicted rough times for the planes and ships in the @entity16 , and an ' on and off ' mission at best as the area 's eight - month - long winter brings brutal swells and high winds to the search area			1
aviation safety consultant , @entity23 of airline industry business publication airlineratings.com , warned today 's weather was merely ' a taste ' of conditions which would soon close in over the search area			1
there are very heavy seas , pouring rain and low cloud , ' he said			2
' in the sort of conditions out there today , the sea is a cauldron of foam with white caps and crashing waves			1
it would be pointless and dangerous to be out there			0
' mr @entity23 described today 's conditions an ominous ' portent of things to come '			1
' this is the start of the winter season , ' he said			2
' and that 's when conditions like today 's are a daily occurrence in this area of ocean			2
it 's winter for eight months of the year , and during that period it is the worst place in the world			1
' the seas are wild and rough , there are huge swells and the winds are extreme			1
they are called the roaring forties , for very good reason			2
' dangerous conditions : planes have been called back to base , with low clouds and high winds making search conditions unsafe uncertain future : it 's not yet known when the search will continue , with experts warning of ' off and on ' conditions mr @entity23 told @entity84 that the conditions ensured the search mission would continue for weeks , while the retrieval of wreckage might take months or years			1
' aircraft will continue to spot debris from @entity8 , although it 's very hard to locate			2
you 're tearing along at 200km/h and it 's there and gone in a flash			0
' that 's the challenge - find the debris then recover the debris			0
and it 's going to be exceedingly difficult dispatching a submersible off a ship that is pitching and rolling in 60 - foot swells			0
' but the biggest challenge of all is finding the plane at the bottom of the ocean , the actual crash site			0
' if this is pilot suicide , you could n't pick a better place [ to crash a plane so ] you 'd never find it			1
' @entity112 's consultant meteorologist and a former military aviation adviser , @entity113 , said that wintery conditions in the search area would mean efforts to retrieve the plane would be limited to short , clear - weather windows			1
' the transition season has begun , and that means the cold air from the @entity3 is moving up and the warm air moving down creating a deep trough line and very severe weather events , ' mr @entity113 said			0
heartache : it 's yet more pain for the grieving families of passengers , who 've now been told the plane had crashed in the southern @entity16 ' that creates a very low pressure , unstable air and lots of storms			0
the transition will hamper searching and make it dangerous [ for ships and aircraft ] to be in the area			2
' there will be periods when it is fine to resume the search , such as in the next 24 hours , but the search will be on and off during this @entity146 period			0
it will be very patchy			0
' [ right now ] there is a frontal system moving very fast and a severe cold front , and from the north a high pressure system and very strong winds			0
and so flying from ( @entity155 ) , you have to calculate the risk for the aircraft			0

the search for @entity8 called off **due** to bad weather
@entity31 has left the search area **due** to rough seas , and all planes have been called back to base
aviation safety consultant , @entity23 , described the area as a ' cauldron of foam and white caps '
he said winter swells and storms could make the search area *inaccessible* for up to eight months
he said it could take years before the black *box* is recovered , saying ' if this is pilot suicide , you could n't pick a better place so you 'd never find it '
