you ’d be hard pressed to make it through @entity3 ’s latest three - part nature series without getting a lump in your throat			1
@entity6 sees @entity7 join a group of pioneering vets from @entity10 and around the world as they save the lives of animals , and on her trips to @entity15 and @entity16 she reports on two of the most moving animal stories ever shown on tv			1
first she ’s in the @entity21 foothills , at a sanctuary where vets are using the latest human neo-natal techniques to help giant pandas to breed			1
in the wild , when panda mums have twins , they abandon one cub to die			1
the mothers ca n’t produce enough milk to suckle two young			1
even in captivity , the second baby could n’t survive on formula milk as there are crucial antibodies in its mother ’s milk			1
vets at the @entity43 sanctuary have developed a rota system that fools the pandas into caring for each baby , one week at a time			1
and that means there is always a nursery where dozens of infant pandas are rolling around , sucking on milk bottles			1
@entity7 with a ' really cute ' endangered baby panda in the @entity21 mountains @entity7 with an orphaned orangutan in @entity55 ‘ you see so many pictures of pandas and think , “ they ca n’t possibly be that cute in real life			1
" and you get here ... and really they are that cute ! ’ laughs @entity7			1
her second trip is far sadder			2
at a sanctuary for gorillas and orangutans in @entity68 , run by conservationist @entity69 , @entity70 , a teenage gorilla , is living with horrific injuries caused by poachers			1
when he was a baby , humans butchered his mother for bush meat while she was cradling him			2
shotgun pellets left @entity70 with a useless left arm , and amputation has become inevitable			2
the surgery is almost too painful to watch			2
but when @entity7 returns to @entity68 eight months later , @entity70 ’s gorilla friends had encouraged him to play again			1
they even taught him to do something he ’d never dared try before – @entity70 can now , one - handed , climb a tree			2
‘ he ’s been able to re-establish himself as the peacemaker in the gorilla group , ’ says @entity7			1
‘ he ’s the good boy in the class ! ’ @entity6 co-host @entity87 with an elephant in @entity89 @entity7 ’s co-host is @entity87 , a vet who works with his brother in @entity92 , and who ’s been flying off at a moment ’s notice to @entity16 or @entity96 to document the strides made in medicine for endangered species for the show			1
‘ luckily i have the most understanding boss in the world – my brother @entity101 , ’ he says			2
‘ it can be surreal			2
i ’m doing the day job – then the @entity3 rings and i ’m off to the airport			2
hamsters in the morning , hippos in the evening ! ’ his experience with @entity10 pets can be invaluable thousands of miles away			0
‘ i had to remove a damaged eyeball from an orangutan , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’ve done that many times on cats because of little boys with airguns – i ’d never done it on an ape , but it was basically the same anatomy			0
an orangutan is like a big orange cat with hands			0
’ @entity123 , the youngest vet on the show , faced a more exotic challenge in @entity89 when he treated @entity126 , an elephant with a bullet in its leg			1
he wanted to x-ray the infected leg , and had borrowed a valuable radiography machine from a nearby hospital			0
but the elephant would n’t stand still and the doctors feared he ’d crush the £ 40,000 x-ray device			0
@entity126 ’s keeper saved the day by leaping onto the elephant ’s back and covering the animal ’s eyes while crooning a lullaby			0
briefly bemused , @entity126 stayed still long enough for @entity123 to get the x-ray			0
in @entity144 , @entity143 , @entity87 attended the annual kite festival , where fliers dip their strings in glue and powdered glass and try to slice through the lines of other kites			0
this takes a terrible toll on birds as the lines slice through their wings like cheesewire			0
the terrified creatures are bundled up by volunteers and rushed to a makeshift clinic to be patched up			0
the first challenge is to give them a transfusion			0
it takes great skill to find the artery in a bird ’s leg and insert a tube			0
only then can the surgeon sew up the wings			0
@entity87 insists that showing these heart - rending scenes encourages the public to help			1
‘ when i made the @entity177 series in 2007 we focused on a charity that was facing closure from lack of funds			0
the result was amazing – financial security , new buildings for the apes , extra staff			0
the @entity10 are born animal lovers , it ’s just that sometimes we have to be reminded to care			0
some say animal programmes are too emotional , but that ’s the best way to motivate people			0
