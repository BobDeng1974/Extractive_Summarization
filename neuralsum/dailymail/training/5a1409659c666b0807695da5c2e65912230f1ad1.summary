speaking ahead of her @entity2 collection show at @entity3 today , @entity0 called on the @entity4 to stop buying so many clothes and make more of an effort to be green			1
the style icon , who showed a ' quality over quantity ' collection of structured , wearable pieces , knows a thing or two about the subject - and she 's not shy of sharing her opinions			1
before her @entity3 showcase at the @entity17 today , @entity16 said that because @entity4 goes to so much effort to get an outfit that looks good , she should wear it more often			1
she said : ' i do n't have any advice for her , [ although ] i think it would be great if she wore the same clothes over and again , because that 's very good for the environment and it would send out a very nice message			2
' if you 're going to all that trouble to get an outfit that suits you , then you should keep on wearing it			1
' i mean you do n't have to have a red outfit one day and then something almost the same in blue the next			2
' this is n't the first time @entity16 has complained about the @entity4 's sartorial choices			2
in 2011 , she complained about the @entity51 ' use of eyeliner in the @entity53			2
' i think she 's got a problem with eye make - up , ' the designer griped			1
' the sharp line around her eyes make her look hard			2
either she should be smudgy or wear none			2
' never one to shy away from controversy , @entity0 was dressed in her usual wacky style with an image of @entity63 on her t - shirt			1
she said today 's @entity66 collection also carried the theme of quality over quantity , although that does n't mean any less glamour			2
' it 's for anybody that wants to dress up [ and be ] wonderfully glamorous , ' she revealed			0
@entity0 's show featured lots of striped wool blanket coats , mulberry and wine and lame , trademark draping on dresses and skirts , a mullet dress and an asymmetric cardi - and a wrap that looked like a bath towel			1
the models ' make up looked like it had been drawn on by a child but all in all the show , with @entity91 and @entity92 in the front row , was pretty sane for @entity94			0
as she is clearly here to sell bags and perfume , in a show at the @entity17 gallery on the @entity101 , the home of punk itself , clearly much has changed			0
@entity0 's show featured lots of striped wool blanket coats , mulberry and wine and lame pregnant @entity109 posed with @entity92 and her daughter @entity110 in the front row as @entity16 targets the @entity4 about wearing outfits more than once , @entity112 remembers the shoes she wore endlessly and the dress she shared with her mother ... favourite shoes : she 's worn her £ 185 @entity119 heels on numerous occasions @entity4 lent the @entity122 dress to her mother in 2010 for horse racing at @entity124 @entity4 wore her blue @entity126 coat dress twice , which originally costs £ 650 but she bought second hand @entity4 has worn this £ 1,200 @entity129 dress twice this year style recycling : @entity131 of @entity132 attended the nuptials of childhood friend @entity134 in the same silver - grey @entity136 dress she wore at the @entity139 parade last year ' all i can say is it 's quite a short collection this time because what i 'm trying to aim for in my second line and all my offshoot products is to just keep aiming for quality all the time and have less quantity			1
' i 'm just trying to do a quality choice for people to wear something that really helps them to look good			0
' that 's what fashion is here for			0
it 's here to help , ' she said			0
the show saw models move through various rooms in the contemporary art gallery and featured perhaps a more toned - down @entity0 style			1
her trademark structured dresses were evident , along with gold boots , prints , metallics and velvet heels			0
' the make - up looked like it was drawn on by a child ' @entity172 was not a fan of the catwalk face teal dream : an oversize pea coat with soft lapels in a bright hue stripe party : socks and matching blanket coat with @entity184 hair animal : make - up matching zebra stripes and crazy socks the models wore dramatic make - up with painted eyebrows and various colours of lip - liner on top of their white powdered faces - framed with glamorous curls			2
the show was attended by @entity3 regulars @entity109 and @entity198 , and after the show @entity199 was full of praise for what @entity0 had to offer			1
she said : ' i thought it was brilliant and i just loved the combination of the colours , the tights , the clothes , the shoes , the bags , the tailoring			0
' i just wanted absolutely every single piece , which is very rarefor me			0
i just loved this collection			0
i thought it was fabulous			0
' the statuesque blonde said while it may have been less dramatic than the @entity0 designs of previous years , the flair was still there and that it was important to remember the evolving nature of fashion			1
mix every shade of green with every type of pattern and voila @entity226 : sporty collar makes this @entity229 dress edgy teal tights : this combo is only for the very mad or very brave odd tailoring and fabric layering can only mean @entity0 giant leather trousers : you thought they were a fleeting trend a pop of purple / orange tartan punk this ladylike look right up she added : ' there were bits in there - you know like the sequinned pants			1
' but , you know , when i used to do @entity16 it used to be boobs and great big dresses and things like that			0
' but , you know , fashion moves , it evolves			0
designers have to go with it and i think she 's really nailed it			0
' before the show , @entity109 said she was expecting it to be ' slightly mental ' , but said that is ' the charm of @entity0 '			1
she said of @entity0 's style : ' it 's really haphazard and sort of all over the place , which i think is what @entity16 's mindset is like , and i really like that the clothes are such a reflection of her and her personality , and it 's really playful and fun			1
' other big shows taking place today in various locations across the capital include @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282 .			0

' if you 're going to all that trouble to get an outfit that suits you , then you should keep on wearing it ' *thundered* the designer
controversial @entity0 was dressed in her usual wacky style with an ' i am @entity63 ' t - shirt
