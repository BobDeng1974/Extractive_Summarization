by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity4 nationalists are preparing to form a secret intelligence service in the style of @entity7 once independence is secured , it has emerged			1
with @entity4 preparing for a vote on separation in 2014 , ministers have indicated that an independent country would require its own ' @entity14 ' spy agency			1
and security analysts believe such spymasters will target the brightest minds at @entity18 , where prince @entity19 and @entity20 studied , for the @entity21 of the future			2
switching sides ? the @entity24 of the future may work for ' @entity14 ' rather than @entity27 's @entity26 deputy first minister @entity28 has said she expects that an ' independent domestic intelligence machinery ' would be set up post-independence			2
but during a visit to @entity33 last week , the home secretary @entity31 said that if @entity4 were to become a separate state it would not be guaranteed to have access to intelligence on terrorism and organised crime from the @entity40			1
she warned that as a new country , @entity4 would have to gain trust before it could expect to share sensitive information			1
' the point is that if @entity4 is separate it becomes a separate state			2
so it is not the same as sharing intelligence across the @entity40 , ' she said			2
@entity48 , a defence and security analyst , told the @entity50 : ' intelligence needs the brightest and the best , and that 's what you can get from the top universities such as @entity55 or @entity56			0
' i know a number of senior academics who work as talent spotters for the security services and this is how any new agency in a post-independence @entity4 would operate			0
' the @entity4 @entity7 may recruit spies from students at @entity55 ' university , it has been claimed clash : home secretary @entity31 , left , has criticised plans mooted by @entity4 's deputy first minister @entity28 , right , to form a @entity4 version of @entity7 but the plans have been criticised by former top @entity73 officer who warned that an independent @entity4 could not rely on the ‘ umbrella ’ of @entity40 ’s security agencies			1
baroness @entity76 said the @entity77 needs to ‘ think again ’ if it believes intelligence from @entity73 , @entity7 and the @entity40 ’s communications headquarters , @entity80 , would be shared			1
alternative career paths : @entity82 could be recruiting from the alma mater of prince @entity19 and @entity20 , who both attended @entity55 university the @entity87 peer – once tipped as a future head of the @entity73 – also questioned whether nationalist ministers ‘ realise the magnitude ’ of providing @entity4 with its own domestic security body to replace @entity7 , not to mention an external agency to replace @entity73			2
her comments came after deputy first minister @entity28 was challenged on the issue at a recent meeting of @entity98 ’s foreign affairs committee			0
miss @entity28 struggled to outline the @entity77 ’s plans and claimed there would still be ‘ very close intelligence sharing with the rest of the @entity40 ’			1
mps on the committee outlined the huge cost of gathering security data			0
the @entity40 government is spending £ 650million to upgrade its systems to cope with the growing threat of ‘ cyber-terrorism ’			0
the work of 14,000 @entity40 diplomatic staff in 270 offices around the world would also come to an end post-independence , with the @entity116 forced to set up its own embassies			0
establishing just 100 outposts has been estimated to cost around £ 1billion			0
@entity76 , a @entity119 graduate who went on to become a case officer with @entity73 , was head of station in @entity122 , @entity123			2
she left the intelligence service for politics and was foreign policy adviser to @entity127 , @entity87 leader from 1992 to 1994			0
in an opinion piece published yesterday , @entity76 wrote : ‘ it can never be assumed that diplomatic or historic friendships will result in any intelligence liaison , other than the most basic and low grade , until credentials have been established			0
of course , it is not impossible to begin a new security service , but it has to be realistically recognised that it demands considerable resources both human and financial			0
' asked at the recent committee meeting if @entity4 would expect to be able to read the rest of the @entity40 ’s secret intelligence , @entity139 replied : ‘ @entity4 and the rest of the @entity40 share an island			1
it would be not just in @entity4 ’s interest for there to be very close intelligence - sharing with the rest of the @entity40			1
it would clearly be in the interest of the rest of the @entity40 as well			0
’ a @entity116 spokesman said last night : ‘ the @entity153 has recently offered to share intelligence with @entity155 , so if that is in its interests it will be overwhelmingly in the interests of the rest of the @entity40 to share intelligence with counterparts in an independent @entity4			1
