by @entity0 families will be given a say over the treatment of patients who are thought to be near death , ministers promised yesterday families will be given a say over the treatment of patients who are thought to be near death , ministers promised yesterday			2
they said loved ones must be ‘ involved in decisions ’ in @entity14 hospitals to ensure the ‘ horrific ’ abuses and ‘ tick - box ’ culture created by the discredited @entity17 never happen again			1
and hospital managers or doctors who try to cover up the circumstances of a patient ’s death will be subject to criminal prosecutions and heavy fines in court			2
the radical rights for families are part of a new protection package for the dying that ministers say will mean an end to the ‘ protocols and processes ’ that led to the @entity17 scandal			1
they acted after the @entity39 told how families were kept in the dark about the fact that their loved ones had been put on the @entity17 and revealed that hospitals had been paid millions to reach targets for numbers of patients dying on it			1
the @entity17 , originally designed to ensure dignified and pain - free dying , was scrapped last year after a scathing independent inquiry found that it had meant ‘ uncaring , rushed and ignorant ’ treatment of the most vulnerable hospital patients			1
in some cases , patients were denied water as they died			1
under the pathway , doctors and nurses decided when a patient was about to die			1
commonly , a syringe driver would pump them with sedatives , while tubes giving food and water were detached			2
death would follow , typically within 36 hours			0
the inquiry was called after leading medical figures condemned the system as a ‘ self - fulfilling prophecy ’ , and thousands of families of patients who had died complained			1
new rules for the care of patients thought to be near the end of their lives will forbid hospitals from deciding that someone is dying and then speeding their end by drugging them and removing tubes giving them food and water			1
the radical rights for families are part of a new protection package for the dying that ministers say will mean an end to the ‘ protocols and processes ’ that led to the @entity17 scandal ( stock picture ) instead , there must be regular reviews of treatment in all cases , dying patients and their families must be kept informed and involved in decisions , and treatment will be ‘ tailored to the individual ’			1
hospitals will be told to appoint independent assessors to decide on complaints in ‘ serious or untoward incidents ’			0
under new laws now coming into operation managers or doctors who try to prevent investigations or organise cover - ups of deaths or serious cases of error or malpractice can be brought to court by the hospital regulator , the @entity119			1
courts will be able to levy fines on a scale yet to be decided			0
the new rules on care for the dying , labelled @entity126 , were announced yesterday by care minister @entity127			0
‘ the @entity17 became a tick - box process and we lost sight of the crucial importance of compassionate care , ’ he said			1
‘ in future , there will be an absolute focus on the individual and the family			0
there will be no process or protocol			0
under the pathway , doctors and nurses decided when a patient was about to die			1
commonly , a syringe driver would pump them with sedatives , while tubes giving food and water were detached			0
death would follow , typically within 36 hours ( stock picture ) ' there will be no assumption of an inevitable path towards death , which became so horrific in many places			0
’ he added : ‘ the new priorities will mean that care is focused on dying people ’s wishes			0
this will make sure their voices , and those of their families , are heard at all times			0
’ @entity167 , who headed the inquiry into the pathway last year , will continue to monitor the way dying patients are treated until next summer			2
she warned yesterday that public worries will not ease until everyone knows the firm details of how the families of the dying will have a say			0
professor @entity179 , the first senior medical figure to criticise the pathway , welcomed the decision to put patients and their families ‘ at the centre of decisions about treatment ’			0
but he warned : ‘ the central flaw of the @entity17 and what made it dangerous was the inability to diagnose , with any accuracy , that someone is going to die within days or hours			2
‘ this remains a central problem with @entity126			0
calling someone a dying person , as this new approach does , means that anyone so labelled will be at risk of dying inappropriately , as occurred with the @entity17			2

@entity17 , designed for dignified and pain - free dying , was scrapped last year
under @entity17 , doctors decided when a patient was about to die
in some cases , patients were denied water by medics as they died
no new laws will end the ' tick box process ' which led to the scandal
