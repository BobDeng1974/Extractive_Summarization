there will be little to learn , so the theory goes			1
once @entity3 have knocked over the country ranked 208th in the world by @entity6 , they will then dismantle the nation who occupy 81st position			1
two more victories , most likely achieved without having to break sweat , will take @entity3 a step closer to confirming their place at @entity14 but with neither @entity16 nor @entity17 being regarded as top - class opposition , what is there for @entity20 ’s squad to gain in the next week ? @entity21 , if you ask @entity23			1
the @entity25 midfielder , who is just starting to find a groove after recovering from a medial ligament problem , believes the stakes are as high as they have been for him , after a year of skirting around the edges with his country			1
@entity23 faced the press at @entity3 's base at @entity34 on tuesday afternoon the @entity3 midfielder has featured for just 440 minutes since his debut against @entity37 last november @entity23 ( far left ) said that he is always looking for an opportunity to impress @entity3 boss @entity20 @entity3 's 0 - 0 draw against @entity40 at the @entity41 was not the perfect stage for @entity23 to thrill so far , @entity23 has been in 12 squads			1
he made his debut in a 2 - 0 defeat to @entity37 last november and the memory of a bright early impression has evaporated since he was shoved out of the starting line - up for the @entity41 opener against @entity50 in @entity51 , as @entity20 went with @entity52			1
in total , @entity23 ’s @entity3 career amounts to just 440 minutes – 29 of which were in the tedious 0 - 0 dead rubber with @entity40 in @entity57 – and he recognises the time has come for him to re-establish himself in @entity20 ’s thinking			1
do n’t tell him , then , that the next seven days are an exercise in futility			2
‘ definitely , ’ came @entity23 ’s instant response when it was suggested there was a lot at stake for him against @entity16 and @entity17			1
‘ it 's always good , even in training , to show the manager what you can do and remind him so if i get my chance , i 'll be looking to take it and impress him			2
since his summer move to @entity25 , the 26 - year - old has also gained valuable @entity76 experience @entity23 featured in @entity25 's disappointing 1 - 0 defeat to @entity78 in the @entity76 ‘ there 's always going to be competition at this level			1
the amount of @entity85 players we have playing in the @entity87 ... there 's no shortage really , so there 'll be people pushing you for your places			2
i still feel i have a lot to learn and prove			2
‘ i do n't think by any stretch i 'm an established international			2
i have hard work to do to get to this level consistently			2
' as a footballer , you want to play every game possible			2
but the manager has big decisions to make			0
he has a squad and 11 places to choose for			0
‘ i have huge respect for the manager and every decision he makes			0
@entity106 was disappointing but because we went out			0
' each game is different so you have to be versatile			0
we have different players to suit different kinds of games in our selection			0
’ the midfielder 's performances have improved over the last fortnight , culminating in a goal against @entity118 @entity23 celebrates his opener against the @entity118 , which was his first @entity87 goal since march @entity23 looked to be full of confidence when he faced the media at @entity34 yesterday , something which stems from the fact his performances have significantly improved over the last fortnight , culminating in his goal against @entity118 on saturday			1
if the knee ligament injury he suffered in @entity128 in july could not have come at a worse possible time , he made his first appearances in a @entity25 team that was out of sorts last month and his form suffered as a consequence			1
a positive display in the 1 - 1 draw against @entity137 , though , was a step in the right direction and he now feels as if he is adjusting to the pressure and scrutiny that comes with playing for @entity25 ; there is no longer the possibility for him to have a ‘ quiet ’ game			1
‘ it 's just something you have to learn to deal with , ’ said @entity23			0
people move for big sums of money , to a team that will always be challenging for silverware , and that comes with pressure			0
i 'm dealing with it and enjoying it			0
i hope it pushes me on a notch			0
‘ working with the players at @entity25 and playing in elite competitions is only going to improve my game			1
i really hope it does			0
it 's hard to be at your best every game nowadays , and the manager has the chance to use his squad in certain games			0
‘ i would n't say i was in great demand			0
i was aware of @entity25 's interest			1
knowing that was attractive for me			0
i was delighted in the end when i got the opportunity for the deal to be finalised and happen			0
