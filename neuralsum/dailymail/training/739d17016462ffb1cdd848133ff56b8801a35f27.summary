drunks who clog up casualty wards should be arrested in a ' zero - tolerance ' crackdown , @entity2 's @entity1 chief has said			2
college of @entity9 president dr @entity8 called on police to break a cycle that has made extreme pressure on doctors ' normal ' on friday and saturday nights			1
he spoke as it emerged more than 300 patients had operations cancelled every working day in the first two weeks of this month , with winter illness clogging beds			1
crackdown : drunks who clog up @entity1 should be arrested , a casualty doctors ' leader has said ( file photo ) the figures , released by the @entity25 , show 1,788 operations were cancelled in the second week of this month alone - the highest in any single week since the start of november			1
most were routine ' elective ' procedures but 71 were urgent operations , seven of which were cancelled more than once			1
dr @entity8 ( pictured ) said it should not be ' normal ' for wards to be inundated with drunks dr @entity8 , who also spoke in expectation of a huge spike in @entity1 attendances on @entity39 , said ' these days very few people are arrested ' meaning ' they do it again the next week '			1
' there 's far too much acceptance that this is normal for a friday or saturday night , ' he told the @entity44			0
' it 's not normal			0
it should n't be normal			0
' if more people knew that if they got drunk they were going to be arrested , they would n't drink in the first place and then end up in @entity1			1
' he added : ' we are nâ€™t really using carrots and sticks to change their behaviour			0
there are no sanctions on people for being a nuisance and for taking up vital @entity1 resources as a result of their own alcohol excess			2
fines have clearly not worked			0
' he described argumentative and obnoxious patients , and their acquaintances , who can end up being physically abusive towards staff , and said workers are fed up having to deal with such people			2
but several organisations including the @entity70 said the issue is too complex to deal with by a ' crackdown ' , and jailing people is not always the answer			1
@entity76 , director of the @entity77 think tank , and @entity78 , director of campaigns at charity @entity80 , told the @entity44 the problem needs to be tackled at the source , by looking at the easy availability of cheap alcohol			0
today it emerged more than 300 operations are being cancelled every working day as the already under - strain @entity25 faces up to the pressures of winter			1
increase : @entity25 figures show the increase in cancelled operations per week from 1,360 in november to 1,788 in the first two weeks of december , 3,274 operations were cancelled - an average of 327 every working day , @entity92 figures show			1
most of them were planned elective procedures , and @entity99 chiefs claimed many were called off just hours before surgery when patients had already been admitted			2
attack : @entity99 's shadow health secretary @entity104 blamed the problems on the government according to @entity99 that number rose 16 per cent since the first fortnight of december last year , and almost 50 per cent in two years			2
some 161 urgent operations were also cancelled - up from 138 last year - and 21 of them were cancelled more than once			1
the same two - week period also saw a record 159,054 patients admitted to @entity1 wards , up from 159,054 last year			0
@entity99 's shadow health secretary @entity104 accused the government of triggering the crisis by taking social care away from the elderly			0
' this is yet another sign that , under @entity119 , the @entity25 is simply not working , ' he said			0
' standards of patient care are slipping by the week and now more and more people get ready for an operation only to face a last minute postponement			1
' the health secretary @entity126 hit back at @entity99 's claims today			0
he described coverage of the figures as ' disappointing ' and said the number of cancelled operations had remained relatively stable since 2010			1
posting a graph on @entity133 , he said that was achieved despite the overall number of operations increasing by ' nearly 1million ' since the same year			0
critics , however , questioned the 1million figure and pointed out that the graph showed only the figures for july to september in each year			0
fightback : health secretary @entity126 responded by tweeting a graph which showed the number of cancelled operations in july to september each year remaining ' stable ' while demand went up			2

call comes from @entity147 president dr @entity8
he said ' very few people are arrested ' so ' they do it again the next week '
comments were criticised by several *groups* including @entity70
they came after 3,274 operations axed in first two weeks of december
161 urgent procedures cancelled , 21 of which axed more than once
