an ambitious mother who has one son and one daughter with albinism says she is certain both of them will be stars , and is encouraging them to believe they can do anything to which they set their minds			1
@entity11 , 43 , and her husband @entity10 , 50 , from @entity12 , both have the recessive gene for albinism , and of their three children - @entity15 , 14 , @entity16 , 11 , and @entity17 , seven - the youngest two are albino			1
but despite being devastated when they first discovered their children were affected by the genetic disorder which affects the skin , hair and eyes , the proud parents now feel that it 's good to be different , and make sure they let their children know it frequently			1
in fact , both youngsters have begun to excel when it comes to sport and amateur dramatics , with @entity16 eyeing up the stage and @entity17 keen to one day find himself in the @entity34 swimming pool			1
' meet the family ' in video below ... @entity16 and @entity17 , both of whom suffer from albinism , at home with their mother @entity41 after @entity16 was born , her parents decided to have another child , thinking that since they already had one daughter with albinism it might be nice for her to have a sibling with it as well @entity41 said : ' you go straight from thinking you have a child with nothing wrong who is going to run the country or play for @entity52 and then you discover there is a problem			1
' you then start to think they 're not going to go to school , have friends , get married , and will look and behave differently			0
' but you soon realise that they can lead the way and will almost certainly achieve everything they set out to do			0
' @entity41 and @entity10 are now confident they have prepared their son and daughter for their lives ahead			1
their resolve to act was strengthened when they saw the tv documentary @entity70 , which featured an albino case study who could not find love			0
@entity74 , @entity17 , @entity16 with their parents @entity41 and @entity77 at their home in @entity12 despite being devastated when they first discovered their children were affected by the genetic disorder which affects the skin , hair and eyes , @entity41 and @entity10 now feel it 's good to be different but it has been a difficult road and @entity41 admits she was worried about how they would cope			1
they had no known relatives with the condition and were shocked when doctors gave them the news four weeks after @entity16 left hospital			1
they already had an older son , @entity15 , 14 , who was born without albinism and had no indication they both carried the recessive gene			1
they later learned that @entity17 and @entity100 both have inherited oculo - cutaneous albinism which affects the hair , skin and eyes			1
it means @entity16 has very poor eye - sight - especially in strong light - and must wear factor - 50 sunscreen in sunny weather			1
the @entity111 family , @entity74 , @entity17 , @entity16 with their parents @entity41 and @entity77 at their home in @entity12 @entity16 loves singing and climbing , while @entity17 is a keen swimmer and keen to eventually swim in the @entity116 @entity16 is a keen performer and loves singing on stage but the bubbly youngster has surprised everyone with her determined attitude to achieve in running , climbing and horse riding			1
@entity74 and @entity17 with their dad @entity10 in the garden at home she also has ambitions to enjoy a career on stage and earlier this year performed with her school at the @entity132			1
@entity16 , who has just started secondary school , said : ' it was quite awkward at first to make friends at school because everyone was asking about my eyes and why i was so pale			1
but i told them why and they understood			0
' most of the hobbies i have are the same as everyone else 's			0
i do n't try to be different and i try to do everything i am capable of doing			0
' i think my best skills are being up on stage and singing in front of people			0
when i 'm up on stage i do n't get stage - fright because i ca n't really see the crowd so do n't get nervous			0
' my mum and dad used to take me to the pantomime and i used to always wish i could be up there acting so since i started my stage school i have just tried to push myself forward instead of standing back and go for a singing part even if i doubt whether i should or not			0
' being a singer has been my dream all my life and i want to make it happen			2
so what i need to do is keep pushing myself forward and do n't stand back from anything that could get in the way			0
' after seeing her flourish , @entity41 and @entity10 decided to have another child , despite the possibility of the baby also having albinism			1
eldest brother @entity74 holds baby @entity17 while sitting beside @entity16 @entity17 , left , suffers from albinism , but his older brother @entity74 , right , does not they said albinism was already a big part of their lives and ' having another child with the same condition could only be a good thing '			1
@entity177 is becoming more and more rare and the chances of a random couple having a child with albinism is one in 17,000			2
but confirmed carriers of the recessive gene will then have a one in four chance with future children			2
@entity10 recalls the nurses reaction to @entity17 's ' shocking , white hair ' when he was born by caersarian - even though he had asked the medics not to mention anything to @entity41			1
he said : ' i just held @entity41 's hand and said ' it will be ok '			1
' @entity192 her baby brother @entity17 shortly after his birth @entity17 , pictured , and @entity16 have to remain very covered - up when on holiday and always wear factor 50 so they do n't burn , as their skin is very sensitive they took exactly the same approach with @entity17 , who is a keen swimmer with @entity34 aspirations			1
and the witty youngster has also have developed a close circle of friends and a close bond with their ' protective ' , older brother @entity15 , 14 , who was born without albinism and runs for the county			1
however , @entity41 and @entity10 's main worries are yet to come as @entity16 gets older and approaches her teenage years and become more self - conscious			1
@entity41 said : ' my biggest fear of having a little girl with albinism was her looking different			1
i remember thinking to myself i can cope with her being blind but i could n't cope with her looking different and people laughing or make fun			0
but @entity100 in fact has grown up not looking different to everyone else , but positively more beautiful			0
the comments we often get are ' look at her beautiful hair '			0
big brother @entity74 is very protective of his younger siblings who both have albinism @entity16 running in a school sports race however , @entity100 was a bit unhappy on their family holiday to @entity226 two years ago when she had to wear a full uv swim suit to protect her skin at any time before 5pm			1
@entity41 added : ' they will definitely become more self - aware the older they get but i had tried to assure them that it is quite good being different			1
' it can get you further on in life because you will be noticed more			0
i tell them : ' if you want it , it is out there so push yourself further '			0
' being different is all part of that , so hopefully they have the grounding to use what they have got and take it forward			0
' @entity16 as a baby dressed as @entity248 albinism affects production of melanin , the pigment that colours skin , hair and eye , according to the @entity256			1
people with albinism have a reduced amount of melanin or no melanin at all			2
depending on the amount of melanin a person has , they may have very pale hair , skin and eyes , but some may have brown or ginger hair and skin that can tan			0
people with albinism usually have a number of eye conditions such as : what causes albinism ? albinism is caused by a lack of the pigment melanin , which usually gives hair , skin and eyes their colour			2
in albinism , cells that produce melanin do not work because of genetic mutations ( faulty genes )			2
different genes are responsible for the different types of albinism			2
@entity284 ( @entity285 ) is the most common type of albinism			2
several different genes have been identified that may cause @entity289 is usually obvious when a baby is born			0
as albinism can cause a number of eye conditions , your baby ’s eyes will need to be examined to see how they are affected			2
they may be referred to an ophthalmologist ( a doctor who specialises in diagnosing and treating eye conditions ) for these @entity300 itself does not need treatment , but the associated skin and eye problems it can cause do			0
@entity100 has to wear very strong sun cream when on holiday a child with albinism will need regular eye tests and it is likely they will need to wear glasses or contact lenses to correct vision problems such as short - sightedness , long - sightedness and astigmatism			2
a person with albinism will need to take extra care in the sun. without melanin in their skin , ultraviolet ( @entity325 ) rays in sunlight can easily damage their skin ( sunburn )			2
@entity331 does not get worse and the condition does not alter a person 's life expectancy			0
however , people with albinism have an increased risk of developing skin cancer			2
babies with albinism often appear to have severe vision impairment , but their vision rapidly improves during the first six months			2
however , vision does not reach normal levels and the child will need extra support at school			0
they will otherwise do well in normal schooling			0
@entity177 does not affect a child ’s intelligence , but may affect their social development			0
for example , if they are bullied because they look different , they may find it difficult to make friends and play with other children in a group			2
this may be partly due to a tendency to invade other children 's personal space by getting very close to see			0
they may also need help finding their friends across a crowded playground			0
@entity366 children with albinism may also appear clumsy because their reduced vision can affect their ability to learn certain actions and movements , such as picking up an object or learning how to crawl			1
as the child develops , and with aids to help their vision , this should improve			0
the three @entity111 siblings on holiday			0
