applying ' night - time sunscreen ' after a day in the sun may help reduce the risk of developing skin cancer , according to scientists			1
researchers have found that much of the damage caused by ultraviolet light from a day on the beach occurs hours after the sun has set			1
they discovered that energy absorbed from the sun by skin cells called melanocytes is transferred to the dna in the dark , causing it to deform			1
professor @entity30 , a dermatologist at @entity21 , said : ' so our understanding has been that you put on sunscreen before you go out into the sun and that protects your skin			1
in tests using mouse and human melanocytes , experts found uv radiation from sunlight causes enzymes in the cells to create two chemicals that react together			2
these then excite electrons on the melanin with energy			0
this means the melanin effectively absorbs some of the energy from the sunlight			2
however , in the dark the melanin transfers this energy to the dna to cause the same damage that can occur in sunlight			1
in melanocytes without melanin , the damage to the dna only occurred during sun exposure and not afterwards			1
' here you have a different situation where what you want to do is add something after you leave the beach or tanning bed that protects you for several hours after			0
' you could imagine designing chemicals that dissipate that energy before it has a chance to get to the dna			2
' there are chemicals like that that already exist and we used some of those as tools in the research , but you could imagine getting better ones that are practical to use in the skin			0
' ultraviolet light is thought to damage dna by causing a ring - shaped structure to from in the dna , known as a cyclobutane dimer			1
this prevents the genetic code from being read properly and leads to faults in the functioning of the cells , leading to them becoming cancerous			0
melantocytes produce a pigment called melanin that was thought to help protect the skin from ultraviolet light			1
people with blonde or red hair , and fair skin tend to have less melanin in their skin and are more vulnerable to skin cancer caused by sunburn			0
the @entity21 study found that dna damage ( labelled as @entity106 in the graph above ) in melanocyte skin cells continued for up to four hours after exposure to ultraviolet light had stopped , increasing the risk of cancer in tests using mouse and human melanocytes , experts found uv radiation from sunlight causes enzymes in the cells to create two chemicals that react together			1
these then excite electrons on the melanin with energy			0
this means the melanin effectively absorbs some of the energy from the sunlight ( stock image ) scientists recently unlocked one of the secrets of how coral shields itself from harmful ultraviolet rays - and they hope it could create ‘ sunscreen in a pill ’			1
a single pill could provide weeks of protection for the skin and eyes , cutting the odds of cancer , removing the need for creams and sunglasses , and keeping wrinkles at bay			0
however it would do nothing to bronze the skin , meaning sun - worshippers would have to resort to fake tan if they want a ‘ healthy glow ’			2
the scientists at @entity157 took their inspiration from samples of coral collected from @entity162 ’s @entity161			0
it was known that the marine organism can shield itself from the sun ’s rays and it was thought that the protection came from a compound made by algae that live within it			0
the researchers found the algae makes a compound that is transported to the coral , which then modifies it into a sunscreen that protects it from @entity179 damage			1
however , professor @entity30 and his team , whose results are published in the journal @entity184 , found that it is melanin that is also responsible for this overnight damage			1
in tests using mouse and human melanocytes , he found uv radiation from sunlight causes enzymes in the cells to create two chemicals that react together			0
these then excite electrons on the melanin with energy			0
this means the melanin effectively absorbs some of the energy from the sunlight			0
however , in the dark the melanin transfers this energy to the dna to cause the same damage that can occur in sunlight			1
in melanocytes without melanin , the damage to the dna only occurred during sun exposure and not afterwards			1
professor @entity30 said : ' when sun hits your skin normally what happens is that it makes damage to your dna in a millionth of a millionth of a second			2
' in melanocytes , which are the cells that make the pigment that is protecting your skin , that is not all that is going on			0
' you are getting the same kinds of dna damage in your skin for hours after the exposure has ended			2
' what is suprising is that melanin is actually doing things that can cause cancer as well			0
however , in the dark the melanin transfers this energy to the dna to cause the same damage that can occur in sunlight			1
sunlight damages the upper layers of skin ( keratosis pictured ) but also damage the dna the diagram above shows the effects of ultraviolet radiation ( yellow arrows ) on the upper layers of the skin			0
in addition to a ' night - time sunscreen ' , professor @entity242 - @entity241 at the @entity243 in @entity244 , who studies dna damage caused by the sun , said that improved daytime suncreens could also help ' because this is slow and takes several hours it gives us the opportunity to jump in and intervene			1
' professor @entity242 - @entity241 , a chemist at the @entity243 in @entity244 who studies dna damage caused by the sun , said that improved daytime suncreens could also help			2
he said : ' researchers have long sought methods to prevent skin cancer induction , and the results of this study indicate that sunscreens should aim to minimise exposure to both @entity262 and @entity179			0
as suggested by the authors , uv dna damage arising in the dark might also be reduced by agents that scavenge or interfere with superoxide and nitric oxide production or that quench the excited triplet - state intermediates			2

dermatologists at @entity21 want to develop a ' night - time ' sunscreen
they found energy from uv light can damage dna hours after sunbathing
they say it may be possible to block this energy from transferring to dna
*surprisingly* , the pigment that protects our skin in the sun is responsible
they found melanin absorbs the @entity179 energy but later transfers it to @entity284
scientists say chemicals that block this energy transfer can be used to make a new type of sunscreen that *sunbathers* would put on in the evening
