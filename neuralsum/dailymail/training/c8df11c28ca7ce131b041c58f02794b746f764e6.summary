by @entity1 reporter published : 16:24 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 05:32 est , 18 september 2013 the devastating fire that engulfed part of a @entity5 boardwalk and dozens of businesses was caused by wiring that was damaged by @entity8			1
the @entity11 , @entity10 boardwalk emerged relatively unscathed from the october 29 storm compared to its neighbor @entity14			1
but @entity8 left her indelible mark after all , last thursday when a raging fire blazed through 80 buildings across three blocks of the resort town			1
the fire began at a frozen custard stand , where aged wiring that had been compromised by salt water and sand sparked what would eventually become an inferno , federal and county investigators said at a tuesday news conference			0
still damaging : authorities said tuesday that the massive boardwalk fire was accidental and linked it to electrical wiring and equipment that was compromised by @entity8 the wind - whipped blaze destroyed more than 50 businesses in the two towns			1
@entity38 prosecutor @entity37 said the fire should be a cautionary tale and prompt coastal property owners to inspect their own equipment for similar danger			0
‘ i 'm sure on every boardwalk everywhere ( at the @entity5 ) , there may be compromised wiring , ’ he said			2
‘ we do n't want to start a panic mode			0
we just want to be reasonable			0
if you 're a property owner and you think your electrical work came in contact with water and sand , we strongly recommend you have it inspected			0
’ @entity14 officials did not immediately return a message seeking comment about the status of wiring in the surviving two - thirds of the boardwalk			1
before the flames : @entity63 's is pictured before 1970s - era wiring damaged by @entity8 sparked a 10 - alarm - plus inferno no work today : several employees of @entity69 viewed the remaining ashes of @entity71 at @entity11 boardwalk			1
the fire was started by faulty wiring in the custard shop last thursday aftermath : the sign for @entity71 stands above charred rubble in @entity11 , @entity10 after the devastating fire last thursday ripped through the resort town and destroyed some 80 buildings depressing : the area was hard hit by @entity8 , though this particular boardwalk had until now avoided the devastation the storm wreaked on other areas investigators said the fire began in wiring that dated to the 1970s and was located under a frozen custard stand and candy shop			1
@entity92 , a senior special agent with the @entity93 , said investigators located wires under the boardwalk that somehow came in contact with each other , causing an electrical arc that is believed to have started the fire			2
@entity37 said those wires had been exposed to the storm surge and grating sand action of the storm , which compromised them			0
but as far as why the wires contacted each other , he said , ‘ we will never know			0
’ the prosecutor said the investigation ruled out all other possible causes of the fire , including careless smoking or a deliberate act of arson			0
the wiring was inaccessible to the public , he noted.authorities even pulled financial records of the businesses involved in the blaze to make sure no one had a financial motive to start a fire			2
inferno : firefighters are seen pulling back thursday afternoon during the height of the inferno , which at one point became too hot to approach war zone : this aerial photo shows aftermath of a massive fire that burned a large portion of the @entity11 boardwalk			1
the fire , which apparently started in an ice cream shop and spread several blocks ruined : the music sound shop was one of dozens of businesses reduced to rubble in @entity11 after thursday 's tragic fire catching a break : a 25 - foot fire break was smashed into the boardwalk near where @entity11 meets @entity14 , largely sparing the neighboring town from the fire that ravaged @entity11 ca n't get a break : @entity14 got its facelift just days before beach season began but now a black , burnt scar will mar its close neighbor @entity11 after @entity8 : workers replace the boardwalk in @entity14 destroyed by the superstorm in 2012			1
unlike its neighbor , @entity11 's adjoining boardwalk was untouched by the storm			1
now , it is @entity11 's turn to suffer ‘ we left no stone unturned , ’ he said			1
‘ this was not a suspicious fire			0
’ it was only by destroying part of the 5 - month - old boardwalk that @entity14 had just spent $ 8 million to rebuild that the rest of the walkway was saved			2
public works crews ripped out a 25 - foot swath of boardwalk to serve as a makeshift fire break , depriving the blaze of fuel			2
they then filled the void with giant sand piles — makeshift dunes to hold back fire , not water			0
the desperation plan worked and stopped the fire from burning the rest of the @entity185			0
@entity187 's administration decided the state will use sandy - recovery money to pay for debris removal			2
he also pledged $ 15 million in @entity8 money to help rebuild the burned businesses			0
@entity187 said tuesday the state will let business affected by the fire postpone filing sales and use tax returns that were due this month until october to help them recover			0
' wrench in the recovery ' : @entity11 's boardwalk was largely intact after @entity8 but is now in ruins			1

@entity11 's boardwalk was largely spared during @entity8 , but the storm got the last laugh thursday
the blaze was started by 1970s - era wiring in @entity209 's @entity208 that was wind and *seawater* damaged in the 2012 superstorm
some 80 buildings across three town blocks were destroyed
