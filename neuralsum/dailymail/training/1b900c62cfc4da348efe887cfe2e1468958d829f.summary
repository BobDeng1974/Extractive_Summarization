rare outing : @entity1 and @entity2 at a friend 's wedding at the @entity5 and @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , in 2010 prince @entity1 is not a regular churchgoer despite being the future @entity12 and @entity11 , the @entity9 has learnt			1
although the 30 - year - old future king was confirmed into the @entity15 faith in 1997 , he is understood to attend services of worship only a ‘ handful ’ of times each year			1
most of these are connected with official engagements or on special occasions in the @entity24 calendar such as @entity25 , as well as weddings and christenings			1
sources say @entity1 – and his wife @entity2 – ‘ rarely , if ever ’ go to church privately on a sunday morning , or indeed at any other time in the week			1
a senior aide also admitted : ‘ i ’m not aware that he goes every week			0
’ while @entity1 is not alone in being a non-attender – barely 8 per cent of those who attend church regularly are young men his age – his stance is unlike other members of the @entity40			2
the queen is a devout @entity24 , with a deep sense of religious duty , who attends church on a weekly basis			1
prince @entity50 , despite his interest in other faiths , particularly @entity49 , has always been a regular churchgoer			0
the revelation about @entity1 comes at a time when @entity24 is already under threat from public apathy , particularly among the younger generation			1
just 10 per cent of the population now attend church each week , while the average age of worshippers has risen to just under 60			0
according to one survey by @entity24 charity @entity62 , the @entity60 is among @entity64 ’s four least observant counties			2
two thirds of those polled had not been to church in the past year , except for baptisms , weddings or funerals , although 53 per cent still identified themselves as @entity24			2
' rarely , if ever ' : sources say @entity72 ( pictured on their wedding day in @entity74 ) only attends services of worship only a ' handful ' of times each year the monarchy , however , has a unique relationship with the @entity80			1
the sovereign holds the title ‘ @entity12 and @entity11 ’			0
in his or her coronation oath they also promise to maintain the @entity80 , a vow that the present @entity41 takes very seriously			0
archbishops and bishops are appointed by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister , who in turn considers the names selected by a @entity95			0
they take an oath of allegiance to the @entity41 on appointment , as do parish priests , and may not resign without royal authority			0
every five years the @entity41 opens the @entity101 , the supreme authority of the @entity15 , and any ‘ law ’ passed by it has to be given royal assent			2
not alone : @entity1 , pictured giving a religious reading during a diamond wedding anniversary of the @entity41 and the @entity108 service , is not alone in being a non-attender - barely 8 per cent of those who attend church regularly are young men his age while there is little doubt that when he accedes to the throne @entity1 will uphold these responsibilities , his decision not to worship regularly will add fuel to the fire of those who argue that the church has little relevance in @entity60 today			1
the last known occasion @entity1 went to church was with his wife and her family in @entity128 on christmas day			2
before that the couple attended a service in the @entity131 in september as part of a @entity135 @entity134 tour on behalf of the @entity41			0
religious royals : @entity41 ( right ) is a devout @entity24 who attends church on a weekly basis and prince @entity50 ( left ) has always been a regular churchgoer a spokesman for the prince insisted yesterday that he was a dedicated @entity24 despite his lack of regular attendance			1
‘ @entity1 is a committed @entity15 and has a strong personal faith , ’ they said			1
aides also pointed out that not only was he confirmed in 1997 when he was 14 , but he and his wife wrote a prayer for their wedding service as evidence of his ‘ continued faith ’			1
confirmation marks the point in the @entity24 journey at which believers affirm for themselves the faith into which they have been baptised			1
weeks before their 2011 wedding , @entity2 also chose to be confirmed			0
the archbishop of @entity163 ’s office declined to comment last night , but a spokesman for the @entity15 said : ‘ in addition to obviously being sovereign , the requirement for a @entity11 is that they are “ in communion ” with the @entity15			2
according to the @entity169 this means taking communion three times a year			0
’ all aboard : the queen yesterday when the @entity41 ’s @entity175 failed to start after a church service in @entity177 yesterday , only one thing could do the trick – divine intervention			0
head chauffeur @entity180 was seen desperately trying to start the £ 10million car as she waited outside			0
on the seventh attempt it burst into life but only after the @entity186 blessed the car outside @entity187 .			0

prince @entity1 was confirmed into the @entity15 faith in 1997
most services of worship he attends are connected with official engagements or on special occasions in the @entity24 calendar
