the national @entity81 fraternity organization also accepted the withdrawal of the campus charter			2
frat boys : the @entity169 chapter at the university campus in @entity83 has been in trouble in the past for hazing alcohol enemas have been the punch lines of @entity177 videos , a stunt in a ' jackass ' movie and a song by the punk band @entity178 called ' @entity182			1
' but @entity183 , chairman of department of emergency medicine at @entity186 , said actually going through with the deed can have severe consequences			0
' it 's something that offers no advantages , while at the same time risking someone 's life , ' he said			2
the procedure bypasses the stomach , accelerating the absorption rate , @entity183 said			0
pouring the alcohol through a funnel can increase the amount of alcohol consumed because it 's hard to gauge how much is going in			1

ingesting more can create unconsciousness quite quickly , he explained			0
the effects have been fatal in at least one case			0
an autopsy performed after the death of a 58 - year - old @entity213 man in 2004 showed he had been given an enema with enough sherry to have a blood alcohol level of 0.47 per cent			1

students walking across campus this week generally responded with sighs and eye rolls when asked about the allegations			2
' it 's like a big joke , ' said @entity228 , a freshman from @entity229			2
' because who does that ? ' @entity232 , a senior from @entity233 , said the details of the case caught him off guard , but not the fact that fraternity members would be overdoing it with alcohol			2
irresponsible : police found empty boxes of wine strewn around the frat house along with three others passed out in their rooms from drinking ' it is definitely over the top , ' said @entity232			2
' but it does n't surprise me , i do n't guess			0
' the harm the news has done to the university 's national reputation was on the mind of several students			2
' if someone wants to be stupid , then they should do it where it wo n't affect anyone else , ' said @entity262 , freshman from @entity263 , @entity264 @entity265 , who coordinates alcohol and drug abuse prevention strategies at @entity268 , said alcohol enemas are n't a common occurrence on campuses , though normal consumption still contributes to hundreds of student deaths annually			1
and many of those can be attributed to reckless attitudes about the consequences of heavy drinking , he said			0
' it 's not unusual to hear that students are drinking to get drunk , ' he said			0
@entity265 said he hopes students do n't draw the wrong lessons from the @entity19 incident			1
' students and people in general are pretty good at denying that they are at risk for whatever happened to someone else , ' he said			0
' so they can look at something like this and say ' i 'm ok because i would never do that			0
' ' however , they may be drinking heavily , or doing things like mixing alcohol with prescription meds that is putting them at serious risk , ' he said			0
to @entity19 freshman @entity300 of @entity301 , there 's nothing appealing about the incident on his campus			1
' it 's stupid , it 's an unfortunate situation , ' said @entity300 , of @entity301			0
