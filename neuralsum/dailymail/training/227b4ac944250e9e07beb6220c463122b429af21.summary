by @entity1 reporter published : 00:00 est , 26 december 2012 updated : 12:33 est , 27 december 2012 while the @entity2 stares over the ' fiscal cliff ' and $ 536 billion in tax increases for all @entity2 , president @entity4 and the @entity5 have been accused of acting like kindergarten students engaged in a dangerous dare of ' who goes first '			1
president @entity4 returned to @entity9 after cutting short his @entity11 vacation and the @entity12 is going back into session , but the @entity14 ruled @entity5 is still out on recess as the deadline of january 1st looms that could damage a still fragile recovery			1
treasury secretary @entity19 informed @entity20 on wednesday that the government was on track to hit its borrowing limit on monday and that he would take ' extraordinary measures as authorized by law ' to postpone a government default			1
in recent days , @entity4 's aides have been consulting with @entity48 @entity47 's office , but @entity14 have not been part of the discussions , suggesting much still needs to be done if a deal , even a small one , were to be struck and passed through @entity20 by monday			1
at stake are current tax rates that expire on dec. 31 and revert to the higher rates in place during the administration of president @entity57			1
all in all , that means $ 536 billion in tax increases that would touching nearly all @entity2			1
moreover , the military and other federal departments would have to cut $ 110 billion in spending			0
this chart shows a snapshot of how single people in different income groups will be affected by the @entity2 stepping off the fiscal cliff the fiscal cliff tax burden for married people is shown here in this graph president @entity4 waves as he boards @entity75 to return to @entity9 to deal with the looming fiscal cliff that the @entity2 is staring over but while economists have warned about the economic impact of tax hikes and spending cuts of that magnitude , both sides appear to be proceeding as if they have more than just four days left			1
indeed , @entity20 could still act in january in time to retroactively counter the effect on most taxpayers and government agencies , but chances for a large deficit reduction package would likely be put off			2
@entity5 @entity14 leaders on wednesday said they remain ready to negotiate , but urged the @entity12 to consider or amend a @entity5 - passed bill that extends all existing tax rates			2
in a statement , the leaders said the @entity5 would consider whatever the @entity12 passed			0
' but the @entity12 first must act , ' they said			0
aides said any decision to bring @entity5 members back to @entity9 would be driven by what the @entity12 does			2
@entity47 's office responded shortly after , insisting that the @entity5 act on @entity12 legislation passed in july that would raise tax rates only on incomes above $ 200,000 for individuals and $ 250,000 for couples			2
meanwhile , @entity4 has been pushing for a variant of that @entity12 bill that would include an extension of jobless aid and some surgical spending reductions to prevent the steeper and broader spending cuts from kicking in			0
president @entity4 greets base visitors and personnel before boarding @entity75 to return to @entity9 on december 26th from @entity111 for the @entity12 to act , it would require a commitment from @entity48 @entity114 not to demand a 60 - vote margin to consider the legislation on the @entity12 floor			2
@entity119 's office says it 's too early to make such an assessment because @entity4 's plan is unclear on whether extended benefits for the unemployed would be paid for with cuts in other programs or on how it would deal with an expiring estate tax , among other issues			1
what 's more , house speaker @entity128 would have to let the bill get to the @entity5 floor for a vote			0
given the calendar , chances of accomplishing that by dec. 31 were becoming a long shot			0
amid the standoff , @entity19 advised @entity20 on wednesday that the administration will begin taking action to prevent the government from hitting its borrowing limit			1
in a letter to congressional leaders , @entity19 said accounting measures could save approximately $ 200 billion			2
that could keep the government from reaching the debt limit for about two months			0
but if @entity20 and the @entity31 do n't agree on how to avoid the " fiscal cliff , " he said , the amount of time before the government hits its borrowing limit is more uncertain			1
@entity2 treasury secretary @entity19 is going to unveil ' extraordinary measures ' in efforts to avoid the nation triggering the debt ceiling ' if left unresolved , the expiring tax provisions and automatic spending cuts , as well as the attendant delays in filing of tax returns , would have the effect of adding some additional time to the duration of the extraordinary measures , ' he wrote			1
whenever the debt ceiling hits , however , it is likely to set up yet another deadline for one more budget fight between the @entity31 and congressional @entity14			1
initially , clearing the way for a higher debt ceiling was supposed to be part of a large deal aimed at reducing deficits by more than $ 2 trillion over 10 years with a mix of tax increases and spending cuts , including reductions in health programs like @entity178			1
but chances for that bargain fizzled last week when conservatives sank @entity128 's legislation to only let tax increases affect taxpayers with earnings of $ 1 million or more			1
@entity4 and his aides have said they would refuse to let @entity14 leverage spending cuts in return for raising the debt ceiling			1
but @entity14 say the threat of voting against an increase in the limit is one of the best ways to win deficit reduction measures			0
another potential showdown is pending			0
a renewed clash over spending could come in late march ; spending authority for much of the government expires on march 27			0
the @entity200 will begin taking steps this week to delay hitting the government 's $ 16.4 trillion borrowing limit , or else the debt limit would be hit on dec. 31 , treasury secretary @entity19 said @entity205 will begin taking steps this week to delay hitting the government 's $ 16.4 trillion borrowing limit , or else the debt limit would be hit on dec. 31			1
treasury secretary @entity19 said in a letter wednesday to congressional leaders that the department will take several accounting measures to save approximately $ 200 billion			1
the government borrows about $ 100 billion a month , so that typically would keep the government from reaching the limit for about two months			0
the move comes as president @entity4 and the @entity14 congressional leadership are locked in negotiations over how to avoid a series of tax increases and spending cuts , known as the ' fiscal cliff , ' that are scheduled to take effect next week			1
congressional officials said wednesday they knew of no significant strides toward a compromise over a long @entity11 weekend , and no negotiations have been set			2
after conferring on a conference call , the @entity5 @entity14 leadership said they remain ready for talks , but gave no hint they intend to call lawmakers back into session unless the @entity12 first passes legislation			0
' the lines of communication remain open , and we will continue to work with our colleagues to avert the largest tax hike in @entity2 history , and to address the underlying problem , which is spending , ' the leadership said in a statement			2
@entity4 has sought to include an increase in the borrowing limit in the talks			0
but speaker @entity128 and other @entity14 leaders have demanded concessions in return			0
the negotiations hit a stalemate last week and @entity4 and lawmakers are returning to @entity9 this week to resume talks			0
@entity19 says it is harder to predict how long the delay will last because ongoing negotiations over tax and budget policies make it hard to forecast what tax revenue and government spending will be next year			1
the borrowing limit is the amount of debt the government can pile up			0
the government accumulates debt two ways : it borrows money from investors by issuing @entity200 bonds , and it borrows from itself , mostly from @entity275 revenue			0
the move comes as president @entity4 and the @entity14 are locked in negotiations over how to avoid the fiscal cliff			1
@entity4 is pictured ( second right ) with @entity19 ( far left ) , house speaker @entity128 ( second left ) and senate majority leader @entity47 ( right ) in 2011 , @entity20 raised the limit to nearly $ 16.4 trillion from $ 14.3 trillion			1
three decades ago , the national debt was $ 908 billion			0
but @entity9 spent more than it took in , and the debt rose steadily â€” surpassing $ 1 trillion in 1982 , then $ 5 trillion in 1996			0
it reached $ 10 trillion in 2008 as the financial crisis and recession dried up tax revenue and as the government spent more on unemployment benefits and other programs			0
in august 2011 , the rating agency @entity290 's stunned the world by stripping the @entity2 government of its prized @entity294 bond rating because it feared that @entity2 's dysfunctional political system could n't deliver credible plans to reduce the federal government 's debt			1
@entity290 decried @entity2 ' political brinksmanship ' and concluded that ' the differences between political parties have proven to be extraordinarily difficult to bridge			2
' a year and a half later , the two political parties are still as deadlocked as ever			0
despite @entity290 's warnings and the political stalemate , investors still want @entity2 treasurys			2
given economic turmoil in @entity309 and uncertainty elsewhere , @entity2 government debt and @entity2 dollars look like the safest bet around			2
that is why the interest rate , or yield , on 10 - year treasury notes has fallen from 2.58 aug. 5 , 2011 to 1.75 percent wednesday .			0

the president has returned to the @entity318 from his @entity11 vacation in @entity111 to deal with the looming fiscal cliff which will be triggered on monday when the @entity2 debt ceiling is hit
treasury secretary @entity19 however has told @entity20 that the president 's administration would take ' extraordinary measures ' to avoid the tax increases
the *inability* to make a decision has been likened to a group of kindergarten *children* playing a dare game of ' who goes first '
