a giant barrel jellyfish weighing up to 20kg has been spotted swimming in a @entity3 estuary - but swimmers will be relieved to hear it 's completely harmless			1
@entity7 officer @entity6 was having a swim with his dog @entity9 when he had a close encounter with the creature in the @entity2 near @entity13 , @entity7 , catching it on film			1
it is one of several barrel jellies which have been spotted with increasing frequency inland as the creatures swam in warm summer waters			1
the creatures are common in the middle of the @entity26 but rarely come inland like a horror film : the jellyfish may look intimidating , but thankfully they are completely harmless like a basking shark , barrel jellies feed exclusively on plankton which is caught with sticky mucus - covered tentacles			1
they are also totally harmless to humans as their stings are too weak to get through human skin			2
mr @entity6 said : ' it was an otherworldly experience			0
these creatures are incredibly beautiful when you get a close look at them			2
' the tentacles really look like soft coral , and round the edge of the jellyfish 's umbrella like bell there is a deep blue line punctuated every 20cm or so with a tiny dot , a sensory statocyst			2
' jellies are more aware of the watery world around them than you may imagine			0
close encounter : mr @entity6 's @entity57 came close to the jellyfish in the warm summer waters @entity60 : the @entity62 estuary where the creature was spotted			1
several have been seen in the south west they look like something from a horror film , but barrel jellyfish are the ' basking shark ' of their species - enormous but harmless , feeding only on miniscule prey			2
often they are spotted from boats in the deeper waters of the @entity26 , the @entity74 and off the @entity75			1
but it is rare for them to swim closer to the coast or inland , which is why recent sightings have made headlines			2
and when the seas warm up in summer and autumn they breed at a phenomenal rate , creating huge swarms			0
beneath the dustbin lid - shaped bell are hundreds of tiny mouths ( ' pores ' ) , each surrounded by tiny stinging tentacles to catch plankton			0
the stings , however , are not strong enough to harm humans			1
source : @entity96 ' they are constantly swimming up and down in the water column looking for profitable patches of plankton			0
' the statocysts are their sensory cells that enable them to orientate and tell up from down			0
' the @entity96 said it had received reports of jellyfish being spotted across the south coast and west coast of @entity107 , as well as parts of @entity109 because of the warmer weather			1
there have also been sightings of turtles in the south - west of @entity107 and the @entity115 coast			0
mr @entity6 added : ' lots of people have been calling @entity7 to ask us why there are so many jellies this year			1
' in the spring tiny anemone like jellyfish ' polyps ' living on the sea bed expand in size and then bud off thousands of tiny larvae			0
' most years these larvae will perish but in years where the conditions are good , temperatures are optimal , there is plenty of planktonic food and predators do not eat them all , large numbers of them will survive creating these huge jellyfish swarms			0
' it is a boom and bust cycle			0
in fact according to our records the last time such large numbers of barrel jellyfish were seen in @entity7 was in 2002			1

creatures rarely seen inland but have flourished in *unusually* warm waters
a @entity7 officer spotted it in @entity2 near @entity13
jellyfish weighs up to 20kg , but sting is not strong enough to harm humans
