the report says that men who maintain social groups are healthier , recover from illness more quickly and tend to be more generous			2
despite the findings , two out of five men claim they manage to meet their friends only once a week and a further third struggle to catch up that frequently			1
men spend one fifth of their day socially interacting with people from their network of around 150 ‘ acquaintances ’ , mainly through online social media , text and phone conversations			0
