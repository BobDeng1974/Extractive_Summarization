in a video clip posted online , the abducted photojournalist , who describes himself as the ' @entity5 citizen abandoned by my government ' , accuses the western media of being complicit with @entity14 and its allies in trying to drum up support for a ground war against @entity18			1
he said : ' @entity19 is terribly busy insisting @entity14 ground troops wo n’t be going back into @entity21			2
the photojournalist has been a captive of @entity18 for two years he added : ' meanwhile , @entity14 puts 1,200 troops into @entity32 to protect their embassy and the airport			1
surely sounds like boots on ground to me … the rise of the @entity1 give @entity19 a chance to look tough in the media just as midterm elections approach			2
' in tonight ’s professionally - produced video , the 43 - year - old captive from @entity43 – wearing a @entity45 - style orange jumpsuit – said @entity19 's use of the plight of the @entity50 minority , which has suffered greatly at the hands of @entity18 , as justification of military force is disingenuous			0
he said : ' since when has @entity14 cared about the fate of a minority in the @entity57 lands ? ' modern history is sadly littered with religious minorities being crushed and neither the @entity14 nor anyone else said anything			2
' mr @entity3 , a photojournalist who was kidnapped in @entity62 two years ago , also said the public is wrong to support the airstrikes			1
mr @entity3 , a photojournalist who has worked for newspapers including the @entity66 , has featured in several propaganda videos released by the @entity57 extremists in recent weeks he said : ' they say the public has a short memory , but the ink has not even dried on the written orders to pull out of @entity74 and here we are , gearing up for @entity76 3			1
' they ( @entity78 ) have grown exponentially so that even the @entity14 military , the policeman of the world , are not able to contain them			2
" so we have spent a few trillion dollars on failed wars in @entity21 and @entity74 " , is the unwritten message			0
' " is n't it worth spending a few trillion more to avoid the spectre of another 9/11 ? " ' in an article published last week in an @entity78 magazine mr @entity3 claimed he wrote the scripts for the videos , although this could be propaganda put out by the militant group			1
hostage : an article allegedly written by @entity5 hostage @entity3 , was published by @entity1 militants ' frustrating ' : two days ago @entity97 urged the @entity1 to ' restart dialogue ' with the family two days ago mr @entity3 's sister urged the terror group to ' restart dialogue ' with his family			1
in an emotional appeal , @entity97 said that the family had been in contact with the terrorists , but that recent messages have been ignored			0
ms @entity97 said it was ' frustrating ' that their line of communication had been cut off and ' strongly ' challenged the group to return to ' their previously opened channel '			0
referring to her brother 's appearance in the videos and article , ms @entity97 said his ' words are powerful and have huge resonance '			0
speaking directly to camera , ms @entity97 said : ' we , @entity3 's family , want to address @entity1 , who are holding him			2
' it is not true to say that there has been no attempt to engage with @entity78			0
it is simply not accurate			0
' this is frustrating for all parties , including those who are trying to assist us			0
we had previously been in contact through a channel started by you , but then this stopped for reasons best known to you			0
earlier this month mr @entity3 's sick father issued a heartbreaking plea from a hospital bed for his son ’s release			1
in a direct televised appeal to @entity1 , @entity145 , 80 , who has throat cancer , asked his jihadist captors to return him home safely to those who love him			0
he said his efforts to communicate with the militants had only been met with silence and he could only hope they had received them			0
speaking about watching the original footage of his son , he said : ‘ for the first time in almost two years , we saw @entity3 when he made a televised broadcast during which he told viewers that he was still a prisoner of the @entity1 and that maybe he will live and maybe he will die			1
‘ as a family we experienced great relief seeing and hearing @entity3 and knowing that he is alive			2
this was followed by the feeling of despair and helplessness			0
’ addressing his son ’s captors , he said : ‘ to those holding @entity3 : please know that he is a good man , he sought only to help the @entity62 people and i ask you from all that is sacred , to help us and allow him to return home safely to those he loves and those who love him			1
