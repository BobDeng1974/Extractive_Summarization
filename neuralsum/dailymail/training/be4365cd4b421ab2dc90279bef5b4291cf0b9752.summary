by @entity0 published : 20:03 est , 9 august 2013 updated : 20:03 est , 9 august 2013 years of racing around kitchens and slaving over a hot stove have left @entity3 needing a hip replacement at the age of 47			1
the celebrity chef is known for ‘ molecular ’ dishes like snail porridge , meat fruit and bacon and egg ice cream – but he has had his fair share of health problems			1
now doctors have told him that a combination of gruelling 120 - hour weeks and his dedication to fitness – he is a karate black belt – have taken a toll on his body			1
steaming ahead : celebrity chef @entity3 , pictured out with his girlfriend @entity21 , is forced to have a hip replacement at the tender age of 47 he said : ‘ my surgeon looked at my x-rays and said all he could see was just bone on bone – there was no fluid at all			1
' he told me that if i wanted to keep doing my job there was no choice – i had to have the op. ' it ’s quite uncomfortable			1
it has its moments when it gets worse than others			2
’ however , the @entity41 - starred chef refuses to let the pain get in the way of his daily work - out			1
‘ i am still exercising			2
i ’d rather put up with the discomfort than stop the exercise			2
not so hip : @entity3 said doctor 's told him he had no choice but to have a hip replacement if he wanted to keep cooking ' i ca n’t play racket ball , which i used to do every morning , but i can do the exercise bike and the cross trainer			1
‘ i broke my shoulder last year , but now it ’s fixed i ’ve started doing weights again			2
i do that about 8 - 10 hours a week , sometimes twice a day			2
’ and with two restaurants to run , endless tv commitments , contracts with @entity59 and @entity60 and a new glossy coffee table book – @entity66 – out in october , his main problem is finding time for the operation			0
he explained : ‘ i want to put it off as long as possible			0
partly because there ’s no guarantee how long the new hip will last			0
’ he is no stranger to dramas having endured a five - hour operation to have two titanium rods inserted at the base of his spine to counteract chronic back pain			0
@entity3 is also accident - prone			1
he nearly lost the sight in his right eye during a play fight with @entity83 player @entity82			0
‘ i rammed a loo roll in his mouth and he retaliated by sticking the toilet brush in my face			0
' unfortunately it still had bleach on which is why i ca n’t wear contact lenses			0
’ four years ago he broke a bone in his hand playing cricket and at the age of nine , he broke his leg falling off a roof			0
@entity3 said : ‘ my hip problem is a combination of martial arts , a stretched leg which put my hips out of alignment and my back			1
' i ’m gradually being rebuilt			0
it ’s funny because i ’m feeling pretty good ... but it wo n’t last			0
