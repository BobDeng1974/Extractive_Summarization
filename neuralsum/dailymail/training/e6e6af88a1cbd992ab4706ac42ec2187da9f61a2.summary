regularly drinking beer could help slow dementia , research suggests			2
scientists have discovered an ingredient in hops which they think could slow the progression of degenerative diseases such as @entity8 's and @entity9 's			1
in laboratory experiments they found that the chemical , called xanthohumol or @entity13 , could help protect brain cells from oxidative damage associated with dementia			1
the research , published in the @entity17 , suggested that people who regularly drink beer might be better able to ward off the progression of neurological diseases			1
' in traditional @entity32 medicine , hops have been used to treat a variety of ailments for centuries			1
' the presence of a high concentration of @entity45 in beers might be linked to the epidemiological observation of the beneficial effect of regular beer drinking			0
' @entity13 has attracted considerable interest because of its multiple pharmacological functions , including anti-oxidation , cardiovascular protection , anticancer and cancer chemoprevention , antivirus , anti-obesity , and anti-inflammation			2
' his team isolated @entity45 molecules and tested them on brain cells from rats in a series of laboratory experiments			1
they found that @entity13 reduced the level of oxidative stress on the cells , a damaging process thought to be closely linked to degenerative diseases			1
writing in the journal , they said : ' as neuronal cells are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress and have limited replenishment during the entire lifespan , increasing evidence has supported oxidative stress as one of the pathogenic causes in the neuropathology of adult neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer 's disease and parkinson 's disease			2
' stopping the oxidative process ' could efficiently block or retard the process of such diseases ' , they wrote			0
discovery : scientists found that the chemical called xanthohumol ( @entity93 ) could help protect brain cells from oxidative damage associated with dementia ( file photo ) dr @entity30 's team suggested that beer might slow down common neurological diseases , but they also suggested the molecule could be used in drugs to better target the problems			1
they cited a 1998 @entity109 study in which men who regularly drank beer were found to have lower rates of prostate cancer , a trend they suggested may also be down to the protective function of @entity45 molecules			0
' our results suggest that @entity13 might be a potential candidate for the prevention of neurodegenerative disorders , ' they wrote			2
@entity122 scientists , however , warned against drinking beer too often			0
previous research has suggested that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to brain tissue loss and that binge drinking is associated with an increased risk of dementia			0
and separate studies have concluded that developing a beer belly in middle age boosts the risk of @entity8 's in later life three-fold			0
doctors have warned that increasing trends of heavy drinking among the middle class and younger people will lead to a ' silent dementia epidemic ' within a few years			0
dr @entity141 , director of research at @entity143 , said last night : ' many drugs have their origins in natural products			0
' xanthohumol , the molecule in beer this study focuses on , appears to have protective effects on cells grown in the lab similar to those lost in @entity9 's			1
' it certainly does not suggest drinking a pint a day could stave off the condition			0
' this is a very early step , and only further work will indicate whether this could lead to new drugs for @entity9 's and other neurodegenerative diseases			2

a chemical in hops could slow the progression of degenerative diseases
scientists claim xanthohumol ( @entity13 ) might protect brain cells from damage
