many of us have been on cheap package holidays where old noisy buses are used to ferry tourists around , but nobody ever expects a steering wheel to come off in a driver 's hands in the middle of his route			1
however , that is precisely what happened in @entity13 recently and a video , which was captured by an unfortunate passenger on the bus , has now appeared online			2
the bus had just navigated a corner when the dangerous incident occurred			0
the driver can be seen struggling to handle the wobbly wheel which becomes more unstable as the journey progresses			0
the wheel eventually comes off in the bus driver 's hands and he reacts to the incident by subsequently lifting the steering wheel up to show a passing bus driver			1
tourist @entity28 filmed the footage and she was very unhappy after the incident			0
she wrote online : ' luckily the bus had just finished driving round a corner before it came off			0
the driver then waved it to a fellow bus driver before telling the passengers to get off and wait for another bus , leaving us stranded in the middle of nowhere ! ' local reports claim that @entity41 have suspended the driver for unsafe conduct			2
normal journey : everything seems normal on the bus during the first few seconds of the video first sign of trouble : after six seconds the wheel wobbles worryingly for the first time carry on : the bus driver seems unperturbed by the wobbly steering wheel and continues driving bumpy ride : the bus driver struggles to control the wheel and the bus during the dangerous drive bus stop : the steering wheel comes off completely and the bus driver lifts it up to show his fellow driver			1
