by @entity0 last updated at 10:39 am on 16th november 2011 increasing use of the contraceptive pill is being linked with the rise of prostate cancer in men			2
researchers say the @entity7 has soared in popularity over the past 40 years , and at the same time prostate cancer has become the most common form of the disease in men			2
there is a statistical relationship between the two trends , possibly driven by men ’s greater exposure to the oestrogen hormone contained in the @entity7			1
long - term effects : regions where use of the pill is commonplace have higher incidents of prostate cancer , a study has found widespread use of the @entity7 has led to more of the hormone finding its way into the water supply and food chain , with implications for human health , says a study in @entity34			1
using data from 87 countries , researchers found that where the proportion of women using the contraceptive pill is higher , rates of prostate cancer are higher			0
several recent studies have suggested that oestrogen exposure may boost the risk of prostate cancer ( pictured ) other contraceptives such as intrauterine devices or condoms were not linked to a higher incidence of prostate cancer			1
a team of researchers from @entity55 used two sets of data to pinpoint rates of prostate cancer and associated deaths and the proportion of women using common methods of contraception for 2007			0
use of the contraceptive pill was significantly associated with the number of new cases of prostate cancer around the world , in findings which were not affected by a nation ’s wealth and therefore probably not influenced by better detection through screening and health services			0
the research is speculative and definitive conclusions can not be drawn , said research leader dr @entity78 , of the @entity79 , @entity80			0
but excess exposure to oestrogen is known to cause cancer and the study suggests that widespread use of the @entity7 has resulted in by - products called endocrine disruptors being deposited in the environment			1
these do not break down easily in the body so can be passed into urine and end up in the water supply or the food chain , thus exposing the general population			1
dr @entity95 , of @entity96 , said : ‘ this study does not present a strong evidence case for an association between the use of the contraceptive pill and prostate cancer , nor does it intend to			0
‘ it is intended to explore the possibility that release of endocrine disruptive chemicals ( @entity106 ) into the environment , a process which is not unique to the @entity7 , might impact on the incidence of the disease			2
‘ however , for all of the 87 countries in the study , there is no information on the level of these chemicals in the environment , with the focus on the contraceptive pill as the sole source , which we know is not the case			0

excess exposure linked to cancer , and it is thought that widespread use of the @entity7 may have led to more oestrogen entering water supply and food chain
