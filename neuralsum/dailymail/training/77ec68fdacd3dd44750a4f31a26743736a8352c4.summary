by @entity0 a fox in the hen house is usually a recipe for disaster			0
but having crept into a coop while its eight residents were pecking about outside , this cunning customer just curled up on a nest of their eggs for a nap			1
maybe he was tired and it was the closest thing he could find to a feather bed , or perhaps he was slyly dreaming of a chicken omelette for tea			0
pupils found this rather cosy - looking fox keeping a nest of freshly laid eggs warm in their school chicken coop whatever the reason , once snugly ensconced he was not going to be henpecked into leaving			1
he barely batted an eyelid when pupils found him lying there when they went to collect the eggs from their primary school ’s chickens during lunch break			1
the excited ‘ egg monitors ’ ran back inside and told @entity30 , office manager at @entity31 in @entity32 , what they had seen – and she grabbed her camera			1
chickens continues to scratch around in the garden outside while the creature happily kept their eggs warm mrs @entity41 , 57 , said : ‘ the chickens were quite happily scratching around in the garden – oblivious to the fox			1
’ @entity45 later moved the creature on and all the eggs were still intact			2
' i do n't suppose i 'll ever take another photo like that ! mrs @entity30 said the pupils ran excitedly into her office to tell her about the bizarre sight			2
she added : ' the children who saw the fox were amazed that they had got so close to a wild animal			0
' as luck would have it , my camera was on my desk as i had earlier taken some staff photos so i took the camera with me to have a look			0
' i went into the coop and there in the corner was this beautiful fox sitting very still and quite unperturbed			0
' what struck me was that he was a beautiful example - we have previously had foxes running through our grounds and they are generally thin and in very poor condition			0

the pupils found the animal when they went to collect eggs pupils ( from left ) @entity79 , 10 , @entity80 , 11 and @entity81 , 11 - all ' egg monitors ' who look after the chickens and their coop ' our fox had a beautiful bushy tail and his coat looked in good condition			1
' with the chickens roaming free most of the morning , mrs @entity30 said they had no idea how long the fox had been there			0
she added : ' a colleague went into the shed after me and had a word with the fox and he left shortly after ! all the eggs were intact and the chickens seemed none the wiser			2
' the @entity100 said : ‘ although this is a heart - warming story , where small pets are concerned , it is important to remember the fox is a predator			0
