a household with two earners each making under € 1million ( £ 820,000 ) would be exempt from the tax , while one with one earner making € 1.2million ( £ 980,000 ) would have to pay			0
the @entity2 government approved the tax in its most recent budget , amid criticism that it would do little to stem the country 's mounting fiscal problems and would drive away the wealthiest citizens			0
meanwhile president @entity14 's popularity has been tanking as the country 's unemployment continued its rise for the 19th straight month			0
