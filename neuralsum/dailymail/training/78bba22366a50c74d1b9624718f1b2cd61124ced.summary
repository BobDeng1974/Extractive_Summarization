queen of the @entity1 : @entity2 has be rumoured to be up for the role of a lifetime			1
the actress said she would like the part of the @entity7 : ' i do n't just want to be his sidekick ' @entity11 ’s best - loved hero has survived volcanoes , nuclear blasts , black holes and his own death — ten times — in his struggle against cosmic evil			1
but after @entity19 announced he intends to quit @entity21 at @entity22 , the character faces his greatest ever threat			1
it comes not from the @entity25 or sinister @entity26 , but from the man entrusted with the show ’s future			1
@entity30 , the show ’s 51 - year - old chief writer and executive producer , is threatening to fulfil an ambition that began as a joke more than a decade ago — and regenerate the doctor as a woman			1
actresses linked to the role include @entity2 , who has admitted she would leap at the chance			1
‘ i would like to play the new female @entity21			1
' i do n’t just want to be his sidekick , ’ she has said			1
other names put forward are @entity42 , who scored a double @entity44 success last month following her sensational performance in crime thriller @entity46 , and comedienne @entity48			2
the notion of @entity48 galumphing around the @entity1 is enough to dismay any @entity50 — as fans call themselves			1
other female @entity52 in the frame are thought to include @entity54 , star and co-writer of @entity57 , and the doctor ’s former companion @entity58			2
she hinted heavily , after leaving in 2006 , that she would love to return in the title role			1
her character , @entity61 , is expected to feature in the 50th anniversary special scheduled for november			2
great @entity65 bake - off host @entity63 said she was ‘ beyond flattered ’ earlier this year when a sci - fi website proposed her as a future doctor			2
but a woman doctor would be more than a disappointment to the show ’s legion of fans — it would betray a @entity65 tradition			1
the character has been a role model for three generations of boys			1
unlike conventional muscle - bound superheroes , the doctor relies on intellect and ingenuity to triumph over violence			2
there is no one else quite like him on television			2
he ’s proof that the sonic screwdriver is mightier than the sword			2
and in a @entity65 bristling with casual violence , that example is desperately needed			2
why must the doctor fall victim to a politically correct trend for ‘ gender neutral ’ childhoods ? it may come as a surprise to many in these liberated times , but most little boys still grow up wanting to be men			2
and what finer example of a man — brave , reflective , with a keen sense of heroic duty — is there than @entity21 ? departing : @entity19 ( pictured ) is leaving the show after three series			1
he has been critically acclaimed for his portrayal of the doctor and is the first actor to be nominated for a @entity44 for the role tipped for the role : @entity114 presenter @entity63 ( left ) writer and actress @entity54 ( right ) are both believed to be in line to be an unconventional doctor potential doctors : actress of the moment , @entity42 ( left ) has been mentioned as a good fit for the role , while @entity48 ( right ) would give the part a comedic edge lady who : former companion @entity58 ( left ) has hinted that she would love to return in the title role after she left the hit show in 2006			1
actress @entity129 ( right ) starred as the doctor in a @entity132 skit @entity30 , a childhood fan of the show , has done much that is praiseworthy since he took it over in 2009			1
he has brought it new emotional depth and given the doctor a love interest for the first time			2
@entity30 has revived a franchise that some had complained had grown too clever for its own good , others that it had become bogged down and boring			1
but now he seems intent on destroying all he has achieved			2
last year , @entity30 told an audience at the @entity150 that he had slipped a clue into an episode 12 months ago , an offhand line revealing that when a @entity7 regenerates , he could be reborn as a woman — a @entity7			1
‘ it can happen , ’ @entity30 insisted			1
‘ the more often it is talked about , the more likely it is to happen some day			2
’ warming to his theme , he asked for a show of hands at one convention in @entity160 to see how many would accept a woman doctor			1
about a quarter said they would stop watching , but @entity30 was undeterred			1
in fact , @entity30 has already attempted it once , in a spoof starring @entity167 and @entity129 , for the @entity168 ’s @entity132 night in 2009			1
broadcast in four five - minute episodes throughout the charity telethon , ‘ @entity172 ’ was a send - up that paid homage to the show			2
when the doctor is killed by @entity25 , he regenerates as a string of a-listers — @entity179 , then @entity180 , then @entity181 , before finally appearing as @entity129 in a low - cut tunic and greatcoat			2
doctor @entity129 exits with her arch - enemy — played by @entity185 — on her arm			0
companions : the show has gone through its fair share of female side kicks			0
the current companion is played by @entity192 ( left ) who has signed up for the next series in 2014			1
actress @entity194 ( right ) also starred alongside @entity19 it was a marvellous joke			1
but to take it any further would be to swindle countless fans			1
the essence of the character — as an archetypal hero , not heroine — would be lost			0
the doctor ’s strength is that he always wins through by thinking rather than fighting — an antidote to mainstream comic book and action movie heroes @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212			0
the doctor was specifically created to counter that trend			0
in 1963 , post-war @entity65 was outstripped by technological advances in @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218			0
the country was experiencing a ‘ brain drain ’ as our most brilliant scientists and researchers emigrated to find better paid work			0
so the @entity168 set out to invent a hero who could make the scientific seem heroic			0
the first @entity21 team working under then director - general @entity227 succeeded far beyond their hopes			1
as the doctor saved the galaxy , science became as cool as @entity233			0
@entity227 urged his team to focus on thought - provoking story - lines with lots of history , chemistry and physics lessons woven into the scripts			0
favourites : @entity243 's time in the role , alongside companion @entity58 is favoured by many of the show 's loyal fans classic : @entity250 's boundless energy as the doctor has left a lasting impression on many viewers for a generation of boys , this was eye - opening			1
they had a new figure to emulate : not just brave , but brainy			0
using only his brilliant scientific mind and his encyclopaedic knowledge , he tackled aliens armed with death - rays , and came out on top			0
the first doctor , played by @entity266 , was irritable and impossible — softened only by his affection for his grand - daughter @entity268 , the earliest of his intergalactic companions			0
the second , portrayed by @entity271 , was a superman striving alone to hold back vast tides of evil			0
but @entity250 personifies the doctor for me			0
with his silver curls and ruffs , he exuded a boundless energy			0
for many , though , it was @entity282 ’s fourth doctor who perfected the character with his charisma , eccentricities , humour , brilliance and lurking ruthlessness			0
his performance strongly influenced @entity243 as the tenth doctor			0
after five decades , the doctor remains unique in the pantheon of boys ’ own heroes			0
there are other intellectuals , of course , but in the sports - mad hurly - burly of the schoolyard , they offer little to emulate			0
@entity301 is a pompous dandy			0
@entity303 is a drug - abusing loner			0
with boys lagging ever further behind girls in school league tables and as the pressure intensifies on young males to reject education , we need the @entity7 as never before			0
the greatest detective in @entity313 is @entity303 , not @entity314			0
generations of grubby schoolboys have found much to admire in @entity317 , not @entity318			0
agent 007 is @entity320 , not @entity321			0
why ca n’t @entity30 see this distinction ? when i was six years old , peeping around the sofa at the doctor outwitting cardboard monsters on a black - and - white tv , i was in awe of this towering hero and his adventures			1
the doctor taught me some of the most valuable lessons of my childhood			0
years later , it has been a joy to share his adventures with my own son			0
these tales enthral and educate , passing on crucial lessons about morality and the importance of learning			0
they will continue to do so for generations unless the @entity168 kills off the doctor by casting a woman in the role and depriving small boys of his example for ever .			1

current @entity21 @entity19 to quit role this @entity22 after three series
was youngest @entity21 so far , taking role aged 26
producer @entity30 said to be open to casting a woman , despite fans ' *disapproval*
