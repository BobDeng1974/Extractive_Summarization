the longer he waited , the worst pain he was in , he told @entity36			1
but even as it neared closing time at 4pm , staff told him to keep waiting to see a doctor			1
around 5pm he realized that there was no one left			1
' i was apparently left there and forgotten , ' he said			0
he started to worry that he would be seen and be accused of breaking in , so he took out his cellphone to record the empty hallway and rooms as a burglar alarm started			1
where is everyone ? @entity6 pulled out his cell phone and recorded the empty rooms after he was locked in he also called 911 to explain the bizarre scenario			1
' i apparently got left in a @entity3 facility - a medical facility - and the alarm has been going off , ' he told the 911 operator			1
