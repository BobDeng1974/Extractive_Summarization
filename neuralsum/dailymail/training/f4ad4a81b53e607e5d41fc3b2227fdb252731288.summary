the @entity0 is being defrauded of more than £ 4billion a year – 12 times official estimates – a damning parliamentary report claims			2
agriculture subsidies , payments for projects in the poorest countries , bribery , corruption and cigarette smuggling are major reasons for the massive losses , said a @entity13 committee			1
in its latest budget report , the @entity14 said that £ 348million a year was going missing , but members of the @entity13 ’ justice , institutions and consumer protection @entity0 sub-committee said this was an unrealistic estimate			2
a @entity13 committee has warned fraud against the @entity0 is likely to be more than £ 4 billion - 12 times higher than official estimates it said the areas most susceptible to fraud were the @entity0 's cohesion fund - £ 176 million - and agriculture - £ 66 million - which goes to the poorest countries			1
these included the former @entity32 bloc as well as @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36			0
cohesion funds were often spent on projects to do with the environment and transport in member states where pay is around 90 per cent or less than the @entity0 average			2
from bribery and corruption to cigarette smuggling , member states - who administer 80 per cent of the @entity0 's funds - were also failing in their duty to report suspected fraud			1
the @entity0 has claimed that just £ 348 million - or 404 million euros - was missing from its budget thanks to fraud			0
however the real size of @entity0 budget losses annually is likely to be around £ 4.3 billion - five billion euros - ' or even more ' , according to @entity56 on the @entity0 's finances published by the @entity58			1
@entity59 also condemned the @entity60 for their lack of help with the inquiry after their officials cancelled their appearance before the committee at the last minute , claiming fraud against the @entity0 was outside their scope			1
officials have failed to give a realistic assessment of how much money is lost due to fraud from the @entity0 budget every year , the committee has said the committee said the @entity75 government was not doing enough and called on ministers to set up a single department to combat fraud			1
a tangled web of @entity0 agencies also led to ' weaknesses ' in @entity83 's anti-fraud system			0
@entity85 chairman @entity84 said : ' money is tight for everyone , right across the @entity0			0
it is extremely worrying that so much money is disappearing from the @entity0 's budget without anyone really having a handle on where and why it is happening and - most importantly - who is responsible			1
' he added : ' that we have no control over how other member states organise their affairs is a given , but what we can - and are failing - to do , is to monitor what is happening on our own doorstep			0
' the committee was ' alarmed ' by the lack of @entity107 engagement or ' seemingly ' , interest in , a huge problem of @entity0 budget fraud in the @entity75			1
@entity111 , a @entity112 , said : ' the hard - hitting report reinforces what conservative meps have been highlighting for a long , long time , that fraud and misuse of money is simply not taken seriously enough within the @entity0			2
' @entity120 , a @entity112 , who recently defected from @entity121 , told the committee ' all of the [ @entity0 's funding ] programmes are vulnerable ' to fraud			1
she said ' criminal elements ' were able to ' game the system '			0
in a separate move yesterday , @entity129 @entity114 refused to rubber stamp the @entity0 's annual accounts in what they described as a ' depressing ' ritual			1
the @entity0 's auditors have found that the overall error rate in the accounts has risen for the third year in a row to 3.9 per cent - despite the @entity14 claiming that the situation was ' stable '			2
mr @entity111 said : ' if the commission thinks that this is a stable situation we have part of the explanation for that rising error rate : complacency is breeding contempt for the public purse			0
' if what i say sounds familiar it is because we are in a depressingly familiar situation yet again this year			0
@entity83 taxpayers ' money continues to be wasted and the @entity155 is still being asked to grant discharge to accounts which have been condemned by the @entity158			0
' @entity59 also condemned the @entity60 for their lack of help with the inquiry after their officials cancelled their appearance before the committee at the last minute , claiming fraud against the @entity0 was outside their scope a @entity14 spokesman said : ‘ @entity14 welcomes the report as a positive contribution to further stepping up the fight against fraud on the @entity0 budget			1
it supports most of the report 's recommendations and hopes they will be taken up by @entity75 @entity177 operates a zero - tolerance policy to fraud , and has taken many measures to tighten its stance against it			0
in the last two years alone , the @entity14 has put forward over a dozen proposals / initiatives to improve the fight against fraud in @entity0 funds			0
the @entity14 is constantly calling on @entity188 to take their responsibilities more seriously in protecting the @entity0 budget			0

officials ' failed to give realistic assessment of how much money lost '
@entity0 's cohesion fund and agriculture were areas ' most susceptible ' to fraud
@entity13 committee condemned @entity60 for lack of help with inquiry
