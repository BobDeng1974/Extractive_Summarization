for the four man team of @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 – with an average age of 40 – it was also a victory over adversity			1
two of the quartet overcame serious injury , including a broken neck and fractured back , and a third faced up to the heartache of his marriage ending			2
scroll down to hear from @entity13 thrilling jump - off : ( from left to right ) @entity25 medalists @entity12 , @entity15 , @entity14 and @entity13 celebrate on the podium during the medal ceremony for the @entity28 on day 10 golden wonder : @entity30 , the horse ridden by @entity14 , rears as the crowd cheers during a victory lap after @entity4 won the gold medal for the equestrian team show jumping @entity12 , 54 , had a hip replacement last year and admits to ‘ having a problem walking about ’			1
but that did n’t stop the veteran of six @entity9 jumping clear on nine - year - old stallion @entity41 in front of a capacity crowd of 23,000 after @entity45 had finished tied with the @entity46			1
his feat was then matched by @entity15 , 29 , on @entity48 , 26 , and two @entity46 riders then had faults after knocking down fences – leaving @entity13 riding @entity52 needing to go clear in the riding equivalent of a penalty shootout			1
the 52 - year - old , who had competed in two earlier olympics for @entity57 , did not disappoint and held his nerve to huge roars of approval from the jubilant crowd as he went clear , punching the air as he completed his historic round			1
incredibly , six years ago he had feared he might not ride in competition again after a serious fall ruptured his spleen , shattering three ribs and breaking a vertebrae			2
. @entity69 ! ( from left ) @entity12 , @entity15 , @entity14 and @entity13 with their gold medals after winning the @entity28 competition @entity13 , riding ' @entity73 ' , salutes the delirious home crowd after jumping a clear round in the team showjumping final @entity14 in action on ' @entity30 ' in this afternoon 's competition for @entity15 , the victory will have been particularly sweet after difficult weeks that saw his former wife , model @entity81 , marry again shortly before the @entity9 at a lavish ceremony at the @entity84			1
the couple divorced after just 22 months of their own marriage , in july 2011 , and within four months @entity88 was engaged to her new lover @entity89 , whose multi-millionaire parents own @entity12 ’s horse @entity41			1
mr @entity89 is believed to have met @entity88 through the equestrian world and their friendship blossomed while she was still married to the international rider			2
that heartache could be put to one side yesterday as @entity12 , @entity15 , @entity14 and @entity13 doffed their hats before dismounting to collect their medals to the roars of an adoring crowd			1
@entity13 leaps over the replica of @entity105 , the last fence in the jump - off @entity13 clears a fence modeled on @entity109 and the @entity110 during his round another @entity113 - themed fence on the @entity115 course , inspired by a classic red @entity113 bus			1
@entity13 makes light work of it @entity12 riding his horse ' @entity41 ' during the @entity121 final @entity15 on ' @entity122 ' at @entity123 @entity115 goes wild : fans cheer as @entity14 of @entity4 riding @entity30 jumps their golds swinging around their necks , they then remounted for a lap of honour			1
but one was not enough and they went round again , savouring the hurrahs of the crowd			2
it was @entity4 ’s first @entity9 showjumping gold since @entity134 in 1952 when colonel @entity135 on @entity136 famously led the @entity138 team to victory on the final day – @entity45 ’s only gold medal there – and the first showjumping medal of any kind in 28 years			1
a delighted @entity12 , who overcame a broken neck and hip replacement to continue as one of the world ’s leading showjumpers , said : ‘ i ’m speechless , unbelievable			2
what a place to do it			0
i have never seen people like it			0
the lads have done great			0
it ’s a dream come true			0
great for the country , great for our sport			0
it ’s taken all these years			0
’ @entity13 doffs his cap to the frenzied crowd after coming through a tense jump - off @entity14 and @entity30 clear a fence en route to gold medal success in the @entity28 showjumping the @entity138 quartet of ( from left ) @entity12 , @entity15 , @entity14 and @entity13 leap on to the top step of the medal podium he then grabbed @entity169 presenter @entity168 and gave her a bear hug and a kiss on her cheek			1
miss @entity168 seemed a little taken aback but quickly regained her composure to continue with the broadcast			0
the gold comes after the silver for @entity178 and the three - day eventing team last week			2
the @entity138 equestrian team is likely to have further medal success today when the dressage team of @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 go for gold			2
@entity12 , who will go for a second gold in the individual event , said he was more nervous watching his team - mates than riding himself			1
‘ i wish i could have gone four times , ’ he joked			0
@entity4 went into yesterday ’s second day tied for second place with @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 , three penalties behind leaders @entity196 , the eventual bronze medal winners			2
but at the end of an enthralling second round they shared the lead with @entity192 , which set up the astonishing finale			0
@entity12 and @entity207 , riding @entity30 on his @entity9 debut , had both jumped clear , while @entity15 had an unlucky fence down and @entity13 collected five faults			1
final @entity46 rider @entity211 would have won the competition in ‘ normal time ’ had he jumped clear , but four faults then took it into extra time smiles all round as the @entity138 team soak up the crowd 's acclaim leaping into the history books : the team 's stunning achievements will be commemorated with this special stamp at 54 , @entity12 is our oldest gold medal winner for more than 40 years			1
a remarkable feat considering he retired 11 years ago after breaking his neck in two places in a @entity229 described the experience as hearing ‘ a loud crack , literally in my head ’			0
the fall caused a ligament to snap , tearing a piece of bone away from his spine			0
a year after he had titanium screwed into his head , he was back in the saddle			0
‘ if it had been just 5mm different , i ’d have been dead , ’ he said			0
‘ when they told me i ’d never ride again i was in shock			2
you ’ve done it all your life and then it suddenly just stops			0
‘ in the end it was down to my stallion , @entity251 i knew he could do everything			0
he was my incentive and inspiration			0
so when a @entity257 doctor said i could ride again , that was enough for me			2
’ since then @entity12 , who has also had a hip replacement and two knee operations , has won medals at seven championships			1
his team - mate , @entity13 , is two years younger at 52 and has also recovered from a serious spinal injury			1
he ruptured his spinal sheath and broke a vertebrae and three ribs in a fall in 2006			0
born in @entity267 to an @entity269 mother , he had spent 20 years jumping for @entity57			0
but after recovering from his fall in 2007 , he decided to switch nationality and become a @entity138 rider .			0

first showjumping gold for @entity4 since 1952 won in jump - off against the @entity46
@entity13 holds his nerve to ride clear after @entity12 , @entity15 and @entity14 record just one penalty between them
gold is @entity4 's 17th of the @entity9 and 39th overall
