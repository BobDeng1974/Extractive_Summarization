@entity1 soldiers will continue to patrol with @entity3 troops – even though @entity4 has scaled back joint missions following a series of deadly attacks by rogue soldiers and policemen			1
the recent spate of ‘ green on blue ’ killings – in which allied troops are killed by the @entity3 soldiers they are training – has prompted @entity4 commanders to reduce the number of joint patrols			2
but defence secretary @entity20 insisted the announcement by the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) would have ‘ minimal ’ impact on operations by @entity1 forces			1
@entity43 security forces have killed 51 coalition troops this year – including nine @entity1 servicemen , a quarter of the 35 killed in 2012			1
on saturday , father - of - two sergeant @entity28 , 29 , and private @entity48 , 18 , both of the @entity51 the @entity49 , were murdered by an @entity3 policeman at a checkpoint in @entity32			2
@entity55 mp @entity54 , left , today sought to force mr @entity20 to appear before mps and answer an urgent question about the decision to scale back @entity4 joint patrols with @entity3 soldiers @entity62 general @entity61 said only large strike operations will now be conducted jointly , with smaller patrols evaluated on a case - by - case basis by a senior regional commander			1
@entity22 said the measure was ‘ prudent , but temporary , to reduce our profile and vulnerability to insider attacks ’			0
but mr @entity20 appeared to be blind - sided by the announcement and was dragged before the @entity37 to clarify the @entity1 ’s approach to mentoring and training			1
he was only informed of the shift in a video conference with military chiefs on monday afternoon – fuelling concerns that the policy of training @entity3 forces was in chaos			2
speaking to the @entity37 yesterday , mr @entity20 insisted there was ‘ no significant change ’ for @entity1 troops			1
he said they would continue to train , mentor and fight alongside @entity3 soldiers and policemen in small groups after approval had come from @entity94 major general @entity93 , the commander in charge of @entity35			2
he added : ‘ there is no change of strategy			0
we will continue routinely in @entity100 to partner at lower levels			0
' the @entity94 have never , or not in recent years , routinely partnered at levels below the battalion			0
' so there is no practical impact on operations			0
’ but elsewhere in @entity3 , commanders suspended all joint operations except large ones involving more than 800 troops			2
killed : sgt @entity111 , 27 , left , and @entity112 , 40 , were the two @entity113 killed in an insurgent attack on @entity3 's @entity115 on friday it raised fresh questions why smaller groups of @entity1 servicemen and women were being placed at greater risk by living and working shoulder - to - shoulder with the @entity3 army and police			1
the latest decision strikes at the heart of @entity4 ’s exit strategy			0
the main justification for troops being in @entity3 is the training of @entity3 security forces to handle the situation once @entity1 forces withdraw in 2014			1
but the policy has been fraught with danger as the @entity136 has encouraged recruits to kill their international mentors			0
anger among @entity3 has been fuelled by the recent @entity141 film in the @entity94			0
mr @entity20 admitted the stream of ‘ green on blue ’ attacks were ‘ sapping ’ morale			1
‘ that is why we are determined to solve this problem , to nip this trend in the bud and make sure we get on top of this , ’ he said			0
shadow defence secretary @entity153 said : ‘ it does appear to be a really significant change in the relationship between @entity1 , @entity22 and @entity3 forces			1
‘ if the approach is we wo n’t automatically partner smaller @entity3 forces at company level on a routine basis , what impact will this have on training of individual @entity3 recruits by @entity1 forces ? ’ @entity167 mp @entity166 , who called the urgent debate , said @entity22 ’s announcement ‘ threatened to blow a hole ’ in @entity1 ’s exit strategy			1
@entity55 mp @entity172 was suspended from the @entity37 for accusing defence ministers of lying			1
alling for an immediate withdrawal of @entity1 troops , he said : ‘ the role of our brave soldiers at the moment is to act as human shields for ministers ’ reputations			0
dangerous : a protest in @entity184 over the film that mocks the @entity186 turned violent monday , with hundreds of men torching tires , cars and shipping containers and lobbing rocks at a @entity94 base on the edge of the capital injured : more than 20 police officers were injured by rocks before the protesters were finally dispersed by officers shooting in the air ' is n’t this very similar to the end of the @entity202 , when it was said that politicians lied and soldiers died and the reality was , as it is now , that our brave soldier lions are being led by ministerial donkeys			2
’ @entity167 mp @entity210 , a former colonel , said : ‘ i would say totally scale it back so that none of our troops are mentoring anyone below battalion level			0
‘ we ’ve had more deaths this year from that revolting phrase “ green on blue ”			0
it ’s called murder , murder by people who are meant to be our friends			0
we should get our troops out as fast as possible			0
’ looking ahead : @entity94 soldiers from the @entity226 , @entity227 arrive to a yard where they will turn in their vehicles and equipment as part of drawdown of 23,000 @entity94 troops by sept. 30 going to plan : @entity236 soldiers identify , sort , catalog and prepare for shipping military materiel that is being pulled off the battlefield in @entity3			1

second order that curbs contact , *undermining* the mantra that both sides are fighting the @entity136 ' shoulder to shoulder '
there have been 37 attacks by @entity3 *government* troops so far this year , killing 51 international service **members**
at the *weekend* two @entity1 soldiers were killed by an attacker dressed as an @entity3 policeman and *feigning* injury
@entity3 police officer shot and killed four @entity94 service **members** in @entity260 , in the south , the third attack on coalition forces in three days
@entity55 mp @entity172 suspended from the @entity266 after accusing the @entity268 ministerial team of lying over @entity3 policy
mr @entity20 had been ' humiliated ' by the news from @entity22 said @entity55 mp @entity54
