the @entity12 said the boy , believed to be from @entity14 , was found in a compartment above the rear landing gear of a cargo plane after it touched down at a military base			1
@entity20 personnel found the boy 's body sunday night after spotting an orange cloth in a small opening by the landing gear during a detailed inspection of the @entity28 aircraft when it landed at @entity29			1
when they tugged on the wet cloth , they discovered it was attached to a boy in the compartment , officials said			2
symptoms include sudden fever , vomiting and headaches there is no vaccine or cure for @entity42 , which is spread by contact with infected blood or bodily fluids the @entity12 's press secretary , navy rear adm. @entity35 , said the stowaway was a black male who may have been of @entity40 origin			1
the plane was on a routine mission in @entity61 and had made stops in @entity63 , @entity14 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 in @entity67 before arriving at @entity29			1
a senior @entity10 official said that initial indications suggest that the boy likely climbed aboard in @entity14			1
the official was not authorized to speak publicly about an incident under investigation and requested anonymity			0
@entity14 borders @entity44 , the site of the first confirmed case of @entity42 during the current outbreak , which has so far killed 672 people , infecting more than 1,200			1
@entity35 said the body had been turned over to @entity11 authorities for autopsy , and the matter is under investigation			1
he said the cause of death has not yet been determined , but lab results from samples taken from the body were negative for communicable diseases			0
a stowaway aboard a military plane is a significant security breach			1
no @entity91 senior leaders were on the flight			0
' security is going to be looked at here			0
obviously it would be , ' @entity35 said			2
' we try to provide as much security as we can for our aircraft when they 're operating in remote locations , and this will all be part of the investigation			0
' he added , however , that some of the airfields where the planes land are very remote and the security is n't always up to the standards that are followed in the @entity10 and other nations			2
@entity35 said the @entity28 cargo aircraft stopped in several @entity40 countries before it arrived sunday at @entity11 's @entity29 ( file photo ) spreading : the outbreak has hit @entity44 , @entity46 , @entity45 and has now killed a man in far more densely populated @entity114			1
the outbreak is the deadliest ever of the terrifying disease as the death toll crept past 670 @entity10 citizen @entity118 ( pictured with his wife @entity119 ) died after contracting @entity42 in @entity61 symptoms of @entity42 include high fever , bleeding , damage to the nervous system and vomiting @entity35 had no details about how well - guarded the plane was during the @entity61 stops and said it was unclear how the boy managed to get into the compartment			1
' we 'll learn what happened here , and if there 's corrective action that needs to be taken , we 'll take it , ' he said			0
the body was not detected in routine pre-flight and post-flight checks during the trip , but was found during a more detailed maintenance inspection of the cargo plane , said @entity35			1
the current @entity42 outbreak rampaging through @entity61 is the largest in history , spreading from @entity44 to neighbouring @entity46 and @entity45			1
on friday the first confirmed case of @entity42 was recorded in the @entity114 capital of @entity144			2
@entity118 , a @entity10 citizen who had attended his sister 's funeral in @entity45 after she died from the disease , died after travelling into @entity61 's most populous country by air			1
@entity35 said it is not known when or where the stowaway entered the compartment			1
the two - day delay in making the incident public was due to the process of having to remove the body , do the lab tests and provide official notifications to the @entity11 government , he said			1
the @entity20 is doing its own investigation , which will include a review of any potential security lapses			2
in april , a @entity165 immigrant survived a flight from @entity167 in @entity168 to @entity169 stowed away in the wheel well of a @entity172 767 commercial airliner			0
