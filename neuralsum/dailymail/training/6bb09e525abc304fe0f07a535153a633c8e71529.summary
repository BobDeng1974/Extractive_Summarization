perched on top of a hill overlooking the dense woodland of the @entity4 , the abandoned @entity0 has an imposing presence			0
left desolate after changing hands several times since its construction in 1901 , the five - storey building serves as an obvious backdrop for all things sinister			1
the resort , formerly the respite of @entity15 , made headlines earlier this year when searched by police in the hunt for alleged cop killer @entity19 , a survivalist accused of the murder of one state trooper and the serious injuring of another			1
for almost 50 days @entity19 evaded capture , somehow managing to keep off the radar of sniffer dogs and thermal lighting			1
the empty , junk - filled pool at @entity0 where alleged murderer @entity19 was thought to have hiden out from police during a 45 day search @entity30 coat hangers and bed frames litter the former hotel , with soiled mattresses and eerie paintings remarkably still in tact elsewhere keys hang on a chart in reception in the abandoned ill which has been sitting , quietly empty , after changing ownership over the past century ' cop killer ' @entity19 is alleged to have ambushed a @entity43 barracks @entity19 went on the run after allegedly ambushing @entity45 and cpl. @entity46 in august			1
he is said to have killed cpl. @entity46 in a planned sniper attack at his barracks in @entity43 , @entity50			2
the 31 - year - old survivalist evaded police capture for almost 50 days by , it was reported , hiding in the dense woodland of the @entity4 and @entity56 in @entity57			1
he was arrested in an abandoned hangar in september , remarkably clean shaven after more than a month on the run from police , and charged with a string of offences including the murder of cpl. @entity46			1
suspicious cuts and bruises on his face were , it was claimed , the result of @entity50 police officers ' struggle to capture him in the airport hangar where he was found			1
during the nation - wide hunt for @entity74 police faced harsh questioning on why the man , accused of the murder and attempted murder of two police officers , had not yet been arrested			1
as speculation as to his whereabouts grew , details of @entity19 's life emerged , painting him as a ' self - taught survivalist ' with a penchant for shooting			1
in his adolescence he won prizes for rifling and later he worked for the @entity94			0
on @entity96 this year , following weeks of investigation , he was arrested by @entity97			1
since then @entity19 has been imprisoned at @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity50 , where he has received no visitors			2
prosecutors have revealed they will seek the death penalty when his case is heard			1
yesterday @entity50 governor @entity104 however imposed a moratorium on capital punishment in the state , describing it as ' error prone , expensive and anything but infallible			2
' @entity98 district attorney @entity110 said he would continue to seek the penalty in @entity19 's case , responding to the governor 's claims : ' this action will not deter my efforts , nor the efforts of prosecutors across this state , to bring accused killers to justice			1
' previously prosecutors said the suspect , whose hobbies included dressing up as a @entity126 soldier to take part in war reenactments , had a longstanding grudge against law enforcement			0
he did not have a specific target in mind when he opened fire on the barracks in august , it was claimed			0
as part of an extensive police search to find him , the inn was scoured			0
no trace of @entity19 was found - he was eventually discovered in an empty airport hangar			1
now , a photographer reveals details of the abandoned resort , home to rusting bed frames , soiled mattresses and a litter - strewn swimming pool			2
' i 've written a book about abandoned resorts on the @entity151 in the @entity152			0
in that research i learned of another vacation region in the @entity151 , the @entity4 , ' said @entity155			0
' both regions differ - the @entity152 catered to a largely @entity158 clientele and the @entity4 started as more of a @entity15 destination			0
i was intrigued by the differences and similarities between these two cultural enclaves			0
' i was also interested in why both eventually became abandoned and deserted in favor of other vacation destinations			0
' ' when it comes to abandoned buildings , what interests me is the cultural history , remnants of the past			0
every building is like opening it 's own time capsule			0
i 'm formally trained as a historian , so i analyse a lot of the contents for their meaning			0
' as a photographer , my mandate is to document these structures before they disappear entirely			0
' mr @entity155 's visit to the inn took place years before it was considered in the hunt for @entity19 , though , he says , he would have been ' impressed ' if the man had been able to successfully hide there			2
' i heard about the story on the news , and it was intriguing			0
if @entity19 was able to hide away in the structure , i would have been impressed , because it is very closely watched and almost impossible to access without being apprehended by security			0
' staircases left to rot lead to cracked flooring and shattered glass panes in the hotel 's lobby , while weeds and plants have been left to grow through the disused swimming pool 's surrounding area mr @entity155 , a formally trained historian and photographer , said he was drawn to the property as it was like opening ' a time capsule ' electricity sockets and a clock in what would have once been a functioning room at the inn ( left ) and a service staircase with iron railings another of the sweeping staircases adorned in green , velvet carpet now blanketed in dust in the abandoned inn 's entrance another of the small rooms left to rot in the @entity224 inn which , mr @entity155 says , is near impossible to approach without being seen a colourful sofa in remarkably good condition is in stark contrast with the chipping paint of the hotel 's neglected walls yet another staircase once traipsed up and down by guests at the inn			2
two dusty mattresses lie askew in a former guest bedroom ( right ) while the hotel 's walls are chipped with rotting paint , artworks such as this one are strewn across the abandoned building a damaged sofa with holes in the upholstery is pushed into a room with a crumpled , dirty mattress in the former holiday resort a rusted telephone sits in front of a gaping view of the dense @entity224 woodland searched by police in the hunt for @entity19			1
right , a photograph of a woman remains in one of the inn 's former bedrooms mr @entity155 said he was drawn to the inn as , with most abandoned buildings , he feels bound to capture their existence before they are entirely destroyed by time one of the better kept rooms in the inn features dark , cherry wood panelling and a wide , gaping fireplace where guests would have been entertained another guest bedroom with two double , wooden bed - frames in the inn that was founded by @entity15 in 1901 reservation sheets and an old typewriter remain in the hotel 's office			2
the inn changed hands a number of times in the 1950s but has been left desolate in recent years a red chair lies tossed over in the middle of one of the largest corridors in the inn , where regal archways and wood panels suggest how the inn appeared at the height of its glamour a collection of disused televisions possibly gathered from the inn 's many guest bedrooms lie gathered in one of its lobbies bizarre artwork is littered across the inn , with mismatching furnishings like blue and yellow curtains also seen in some areas a bed frame and broken mattress lie toppled against the wall while an old - fashioned telephone and lamp stand in the middle of one of the rooms			2
right , colourful fabrics once possibly used for curtains are thrown in the middle of the floor peeling green walls and mould poking through the carpet of one guest bedroom where two red armchairs have pride of place another of the abandoned ballrooms of lobbies where alleged cop killer @entity19 was thought to have once been hiding the inn in @entity50 was searched as part of an extensive hunt for the alleged cop killer			1

@entity332 has been left abandoned after being built in 1901 and then changing hands several times
