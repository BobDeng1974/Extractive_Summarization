a @entity15 blimp burst into flames and *plunged* to the ground in @entity9 in 2011
pilot @entity2 was killed but ensured his three passengers survived
mr @entity2 told his passengers , all *journalists* , to jump to the ground while he tried to land safely
but once the three had leapt , the loss of weight caused the blimp to soar skywards and burst into flames before crashing
