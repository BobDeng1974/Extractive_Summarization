by @entity0 published : 17:58 est , 30 december 2012 updated : 17:58 est , 30 december 2012 holiday sales this year have been the weakest since 2008 as analysts fear that without a driving ' consumer engine ' the economy may stagnate			1
the season 's poor profits are expected to reverberate throughout the economy with stores saddled with excess merchandise , forcing them to slash prices and accept razor - thin profit margins			1
demand will soften for goods up and down the supply chain , leading eventually to a decline in orders for factory goods and weaker manufacturing			1
slowdown : holiday spending has been at its lowest since 2008 , financial analysts warned which could have a knock - on effect on the economy however there are plenty of reasons to believe that these fears are overblown , some market - watchers argue			1
auto sales are strong , as are some measures of consumer sentiment			1
home values are rising , leaving fewer americans on the brink of foreclosure and helping many feel more financially secure			1
above all , they point out , there is nothing permanent about the ' fiscal cliff ' , a set of tax hikes and spending cuts that will automatically take effect at the beginning of 2013 if lawmakers are unable to reach a deal to avert it			1
when the fiscal issue is addressed and demand bounces back , beaten - down retail stocks may turn out to be this year 's best after - @entity52 bargain			1
' there may be some caution ahead of the fiscal cliff ' because of uncertainty about tax rates , ' but it 's more of a road bump than any fundamental weakness , ' says @entity61 , chief global strategist for @entity62			2
he notes that a daily tracker of consumer sentiment , the @entity65 , rose friday to 98.9 , the highest level measured since january 2008			2
other measures of consumer sentiment appear weaker , but @entity61 believes the @entity65 data is more reliable because it is updated daily			2
most other indices rely on monthly surveys			2
@entity71 revisited : shoppers headed into the stores as early as 6am the day after @entity74 ( pictured ) , and retailers were hoping for the same kind of turn out today the fiscal cliff is n't the only reason consumers slowed down in november and december			2
americans were buffeted by a series of events that made them more likely to stay home			1
superstorm @entity85 caused steep holiday sales declines in the @entity88 and @entity89 that made the national picture appear far weaker			1
the presidential election distracted people in november , the @entity94 massacre in december			2
and the rising din about @entity97 's current budget impasse left many people unsure what their 2013 household budgets will look like			1
the outcome : holiday sales of electronics , clothing , jewelry and home goods in the two months before @entity52 increased just 0.7 percent compared with last year , according to preliminary data released on tuesday by @entity108 , which tracks holiday spending across all payment methods			1
that 's the weakest holiday performance since 2008 , when sales dropped several percent as the cresting financial crisis pushed the economy into a deep recession			1
for many , the early results were a worrisome sign of things to come			2
@entity120 , president and chief investment officer of @entity122 in @entity123 , @entity124 , called the retail sales result ' onerous ' and ' a negative overhang on the market '			1
devastating blow : the effects of @entity85 , seen here in @entity131 , @entity124 , had a knock - on effect on the @entity134 economy still , the nation 's largest retail trade group , the @entity135 , is sticking to its forecast that total sales for november and december will be up 4.1 per cent from last year			1
a clearer picture will emerge next week as retailers like @entity141 and @entity142 report monthly sales			1
that did n't keep investors from reacting hastily to the grim early data			2
retail stocks in the @entity148 fell 5.4 per cent this month , while the broader index declined only 1 per cent			2
computer and electronics retailers fared the worst , sinking 10.3 percent			2
not so fast , says @entity152 , market strategist with @entity154 in @entity155			2
she favors the consumer discretionary sector , represented in the @entity157 500 by @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity142 and @entity160 , among others			0
' the consumer has shown surprising resilience throughout this tepid recovery and we believe will continue to do so , ' @entity152 says			0
the housing turnaround ' will further aid consumer and consumer confidence '			0
sales of new homes rose in november to the fastest pace in two and a half years , the government said on thursday			1
the @entity174 ' pending home sales index also rose last month to its highest level in two and a half years			1
consumer spending is a critical indicator of economic activity			0
it accounts for about 70 per cent of the economy , so a true slowdown could have a painful ripple effect			0
that 's especially true in the final two months of the year , which contribute as much as 40 per cent of annual sales for many retailers			1
some analysts are warning that the pain for retailers has only just begun			0
@entity190 , chief equities analyst at @entity191 , says revenue results and fourth - quarter earnings forecasts , due out early next month , pose another threat to retail stocks			0
@entity190 recommends betting against some weaker brands , including teen apparel chain @entity197			0
assuming stocks continue to sink because of weak guidance and ' general market angst , ' @entity190 said in a note to clients on friday , ' the moment to potentially entertain this sector from a long perspective will be sometime before earnings season begins in mid-february '			0
according to @entity61 and other market bulls , consumers have n't meaningfully slowed their spending			0
they 're merely holding off as they wait for lawmakers to craft a deal that would prevent some of the scheduled tax increases			0
' there 's a difference between confidence and spending attitudes , ' @entity61 says			0
' people are generally feeling more confident because home prices are going up			1
' @entity61 and others believe that a deal on the fiscal cliff is all but inevitable - eventually			0
he acknowledges that the waiting could be painful for consumers , retailers and most other businesses , but says : ' if we do n't get a fiscal cliff deal , then we 'll wait and get a fiscal cliff deal			0
' analysts who doubt that spending will bounce back quite so quickly argue that consumers are still paying down debt and have less interest in shopping sprees , in part because median incomes are falling			0
despite the stronger housing market and other positive signs , ' they 're going to take the opportunity to retrench , rather than buy stuff '			0
says @entity240 , portfolio manager for @entity241			0
@entity242 , manager of the hedge fund @entity243 , says consumers may be shopping less because economic turbulence has helped people reassess the value of what they consume			0
' we 've overconsumed for so long ... how much do you really need to add ? ' he says			0
' to some extent , it 's healthy for @entity134 to live within their means			0
but clearly , this week , it 's not great for retail stocks			0

@entity85 caused steep declines in the @entity88 and @entity89
however *optimists* point to strong car sales and rising home values
