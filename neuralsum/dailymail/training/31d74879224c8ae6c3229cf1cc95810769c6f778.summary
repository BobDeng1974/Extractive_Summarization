probe : legal sources in @entity8 said the photographer facing an investigation was believed to be @entity10 ( left ) , who took images of @entity5 ( right , pictured tonight in @entity27 ) in the south of @entity6 in september @entity5 , 31 , and 30 - year - old prince @entity29 took legal action against @entity31 in september , as their lawyer , @entity32 , described the @entity5 as a ' a young woman , not an object ’			1
he said the royal couple had suffered a ' grotesque breach of privacy ' and felt ' violated ' during a ' highly intimate moment during a scene of married life '			0
ms @entity10 , whose name is pronounced ' sewer ' , has kept a low profile ever since the case , but police are believed to have arrested her earlier this month			2
she took the photos on september 5 as the couple relaxed at @entity49 's retreat , @entity50 , in @entity16			2
referring to princess @entity52 's death in 1997 , mr @entity32 said it was ' just six days after the 15th anniversary of the cynical and morbid hunt which led to the death of @entity29 's mother '			0
mr @entity32 told the court @entity29 and @entity5 could not have known they were being spied on and a photographer would have needed a long lens , even if he or she was on a public road			1
controversial images : the @entity6 magazine closer showed topless pictures of @entity5 in an issue last september mr @entity32 said that if the original digital images were not handed in , the @entity67 group - which publishes closer - should be fined £ 8,000 a day for non-compliance			1
the @entity70 and @entity5 also launched criminal proceedings against the then unnamed photographer under @entity6 's strict privacy laws			1

ms @entity10 has denied being responsible for taking any indecent images			2
she says she took pictures of @entity5 in her swimsuit but not topless			0
yet , despite her claims , no other photographer has been identified , nor even been placed in the area at the time			0
@entity88 , representing the magazine , told a court case in the @entity8 suburb of @entity92 last year that topless photographs were no longer considered shocking			0
she denied that the chateau was inaccessible to public view and claimed the magazine did not hold the rights to the pictures , so it could not be proved that it intended to republish them			0
photography spot : some pictures were shot from a public road on a hill less than half - a - mile from the former hunting lodge , close to the medieval village of @entity106 , although it is possible to get closer on foot ms @entity10 , who lives close to @entity50 , deep in the @entity16 countryside east of @entity110 , told friends there was no sign of @entity115 or @entity6 police anywhere , so allowing ' any photographer who wanted ' to take images			1
some were shot from a public road on a hill less than half - a - mile from the former hunting lodge , close to the medieval village of @entity106 , although it is possible to get closer on foot			0
the road , and nearby path , offers clear views of the @entity50 's raised swimming pool and its sun loungers , where @entity5 and @entity29 spent most of their four day break			2
