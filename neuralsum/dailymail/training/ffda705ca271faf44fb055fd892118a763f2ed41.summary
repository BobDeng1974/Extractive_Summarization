@entity8 , who is rated among the northern hemisphere 's finest number eights , is set to line up against current world leader in that position @entity13			1
read , the 2013 @entity15 world player of the year , is firmly established as a pivotal member of coach @entity18 's all - conquering @entity7 side			2
@entity0 has said opposite number @entity13 is among the best in the world ahead of their meeting @entity13 has featured in five winning @entity7 teams against @entity6 , and @entity0 is fully aware of the threat he poses			1

' he is someone you look up to and someone you can learn from			0
' he has so much to his game - there are no obvious weaknesses			1
he does everything really well , and he can create something out of nothing			0
' @entity37 8 @entity0 said @entity13 had no obvious weaknesses and was good at everything if @entity6 are to have any chance of ending their 25 - test losing run against the @entity7 , then they will need to produce a vintage performance			1
having been beaten at home by @entity48 earlier this month , despite outscoring the @entity48 on tries , and then endured a chronic struggle before edging out 14 - man @entity51 , the form guide suggests win number 26 for @entity7			1
' they are the number one side in the world , and they will be a good challenge to anyone , ' @entity0 added			2
' but that is what you play for - to measure yourself up against the best			0
@entity13 has been in five winning @entity7 teams against @entity6 and @entity0 is aware of the threat he poses ' it was pretty much a disappointing performance ( against @entity51 )			1
we got the result , but the performance was n't good enough and everybody knows that			0

' @entity6 head coach @entity79 , meanwhile , believes his players must adopt a positive approach to facing international rugby 's biggest challenge			2
' you have to play , be direct , run hard and be physical at the breakdown , ' @entity79 said			0
@entity0 scores a try as for @entity6 against @entity51 , only for it to be disallowed by the referee for a knock - on ' it is a relatively simple message			1
you have to keep possession and look to put them under pressure , and you have to be able to defend their threats because their accuracy , vision and creating space and seeing opportunities are what make them different from other teams			0
' you saw that against @entity102 ( earlier this month ) , who looked comfortable for two or three phases and then for a split - second they over-chased to the open side and left the short side vulnerable			0
' the @entity7 spotted that and ( @entity111 ) @entity110 scored from a situation where @entity102 were not under any real pressure			0
those are the things you have to be aware of to be able to stop them and put yourself in the game			0
