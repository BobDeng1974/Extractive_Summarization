passengers have been struck down by an outbreak of gastric illness and confined to their cabins for the second time this month on a luxury ship operated by @entity6			1
it is not known how many passengers have been hit by the vomiting bug on the @entity10 , which is sailing to its home port in @entity12			2
@entity6 confirmed staff are attempting to contain an ‘ extremely contagious gastric illness ’ , just days after the ship underwent a ‘ deep clean ’ in response to an earlier outbreak			0
passengers who have been struck down by the bug on the @entity10 are being confined to their cabins a relative of a passenger who is currently on board the @entity20 said quarantine restrictions have been imposed at least twice during the 13 - night return journey from @entity12 to the @entity26 and @entity27			1
the relative told @entity29 at least one swimming pool and casino tables were made off - limits to those on the vessel			0
it left the @entity36 on may 11 and is scheduled to return on sunday on a voyage priced from approximately £ 1,000 per person			0
the ship , which has a capacity of 1,350 , is scheduled to depart the same day on a seven - night cruise to @entity42 and @entity43			1
a spokeswoman for @entity6 told @entity29 : ‘ it is very frustrating that , even though we went to great lengths to “ deep clean ” and sanitise the ship before this cruise set sail , a number of guests have been affected by gastric illness			1
‘ the number of guests affected is smaller than on the previous sailing , but it is very disappointing that any guests should have their cruise holiday impacted in this unfortunate way			2
the @entity20 is nearing the end of a 13 - night return journey from @entity12 to the @entity26 and @entity27 ‘ as always , we are doing all that we can to contain the spread of this extremely contagious gastric illness , in line with @entity6 's approved prevention and control plan			1
the spokeswoman said guests who are ill are required to remain in their cabins , with complimentary room service and entertainment , to minimise contact with other guests			1
it is not the first time @entity6 cruise passengers have been hit by gastric illnesses			2
between october 2009 and may 2010 , 130 passengers fell ill on its cruise liner @entity80 , a sister ship of that involved in the latest incident			1
in 2014 , the company paid out £ 280,000 compensation to those affected			0
in march and april 2011 , 12 passengers sailing around the @entity88 became ill , again on @entity80 , with some later given £ 10,000 payouts			0
then in 2013 , the company reported an outbreak of ' a gastroenteritis - type illness ' on @entity80 after it left @entity93 for a 10 - night ' @entity94 '			2
in that case , 72 passengers were affected			0
this was followed by an outbreak on the @entity10 earlier this month as it sailed to the @entity101 fjords			0
a law firm said it has been contacted by passengers to investigate the cause of their illness			0
she added : ‘ the gastro - enteritis virus is spread very easily by contact with surfaces and from person - to - person , and all @entity6 guests are made aware of the importance of meticulous hygiene at all times			2
’ earlier this month it was estimated hundreds of passengers were hit by a vomiting bug – believed to be norovirus – that forced @entity6 to cut short an eight - day cruise to the @entity101 fjords			1
the earlier outbreak on the ship – which was carrying 1,163 passengers at the time – was so bad it returned to its home port a day early to be ‘ systematically sanitised ’ ahead of its trip to the @entity26 and @entity27			1
some of those who fell ill with diarrhoea , stomach cramps and fever have instructed a law firm to investigate the cause of their illness			0
@entity6 believed the illness was brought onto the ship , as the first case was reported within hours of its departure from @entity12 on may 3 , and it takes 12 to 48 hours for norovirus symptoms to appear			1
the company said it asks guests complete a medical questionnaire before each voyage , and reminds them to use sanitising hand gel and take other precautions on board			0
it also said frequent cleaning of all areas of the ship is carried out			0
the spokeswoman said : ‘ at @entity6 , the health , safety and well - being of all our guests and crew is paramount , and we believe that our systems for preventing the spread of illness on board our ships are amongst the best within the industry			2

the 1,350 - passenger ship is currently sailing back to @entity12
it is nearing the end of its 13 - night journey to the @entity26 and @entity27
an *unknown* number of passengers has taken ill on board the ship
@entity6 said ill passengers are required to remain in their cabins
