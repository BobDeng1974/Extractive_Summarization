beleaguered @entity1 anchor @entity0 has finally been suspended without pay amid a firestorm of criticism over false claims he was inside a helicopter that was gunned down over @entity7			1
@entity0 , anchor and managing editor of the flagship @entity11 show , had been under fire for 11 days after being called out on the overblown story by indignant veterans of the 2003 invasion			1
bosses at the network finally acted after deciding @entity0 's own decision to remove himself from anchoring for ' several days ' was not enough			1
the decision was announced by the @entity25 president of @entity26 , @entity24 , right , who has overseen a string of high - profile departures boots on the ground : @entity0 , pictured above covering @entity7 , was pulled up by veterans on an overblown story of being aboard a helicopter hit by an rpg - which it emerged he was not on at all in a note sent to @entity1 staff , @entity24 , the president of @entity1 's news division , described his puffed - up retellings of events from 2003 as ' wrong and completely inappropriate '			1
in the mean time @entity43 , who has already covered two broadcasts for @entity0 , will sit in the nightly news anchor 's chair			1
the scandal began on january 30 , when @entity0 repeated an often - told anecdote about being on board a @entity52 helicopter during the 2003 @entity7 invasion			1
he said that he was on board a chopper which got hit by a rocket - propelled grenade and was forced to land			0
in fact , he was on a completely different helicopter			0
after being called out on the tall tale by veterans who objected to his glory - grabbing , @entity0 issued an on - air apology - and said he had been in a ' following ' helicopter			1
this detail too came under scrutiny , and it emerged his chopper had been part of a different mission and was around half an hour behind			0
stand - in : @entity43 , right , will fill the nightly news anchor 's chair while @entity0 is away dead body ? another @entity0 anecdote - of seeing a dead body float down a street in @entity77 's @entity76 during @entity78 , was also called into question in danger ? @entity0 also gave a contentious account of his time covering @entity84 's war with @entity85 - once claiming there was rocket fire ' just underneath ' the helicopter ( above ) he was riding in - a detail that was notably absent from his reporting at the time tough calls : @entity24 has been behind high - profile sackings at @entity1 @entity24 , the @entity93 flown over to rescue @entity1 's news operation in 2013 , has form when it comes to cutting high - profile newsmen loose			1
after arriving to a ratings slide at several major shows , @entity24 was uncompromising in cutting out figures that some saw as staid and unexciting			2
@entity102 , the longtime moderate on the @entity105 political show , was sacked last august after @entity24 after extensively wrangling over the show 's format and guests , according to the @entity109			1
@entity102 was reportedly picking up his kids from summer camp when @entity112 broke the news that he was being replaced - which @entity1 then had to rush to confirm			1
that sacking came not long after the network got rid of @entity116 - a former @entity118 executive whom @entity24 employed for a total of just ten weeks			1
@entity116 reportedly made so many enemies in his task of reforming the today show that it became impossible to keep him on			0
in a memo to @entity1 staffers , @entity24 said : ' he and i have come to the conclusion that this is not the right fit			1
' whether @entity0 will ultimately be faced with the same conclusion remains to be seen			2
his plight worsened after other grand , personal stories - from @entity78 , @entity84 's 2006 war with @entity85 , and even a childhood tale of being mugged - were also called into question			2
in her note , @entity24 wrote : ' we have decided today to suspend @entity0 as managing editor and @entity137 for six months			1
' the suspension will be without pay and is effective immediately			0
' ' while on @entity11 on friday , january 30 , 2015 , @entity0 misrepresented events which occurred while he was covering the @entity141 in 2003			2
' it then became clear that on other occasions @entity0 had done the same while telling that story in other venues			0
this was wrong and completely inappropriate for someone in @entity0 ’s position			1
' in addition , we have concerns about comments that occurred outside @entity26 while @entity0 was talking about his experiences in the field			0
@entity155 , the ceo of @entity156 , also spoke out in the message			1
he said : ' by his actions , @entity0 has jeopardized the trust millions of @entity161 place in @entity26			2
' his actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate			0
' however , he implied that @entity0 would eventually come back from the suspension , saying he is ' committed ' to regaining his tattered credibility			2
@entity155 said : ' he deserves a second chance and we are rooting for him			0
@entity0 has shared his deep remorse with me and he is committed to winning back everyone ’s trust			2
currently off the air after he admitted to lying about being hit by enemy fire in @entity7 , a number of @entity0 ' other seemingly outlandish claims are currently coming under increased scrutiny @entity176 , @entity177 , 1970s in a 2011 interview , @entity0 recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy			1
however in a 2005 @entity184 interview , @entity0 had claimed to save not one but two puppies			0
in the same @entity184 interview @entity0 also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling @entity190 trees in the sleepy @entity177 town in which he grew up			0
a number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone ‘ stuck a .38 - caliber in my face '			0
@entity141 , 2003 over the years @entity0 has told multiple versions of a story about being in an army chinook helicopter during the @entity141 in 2003			2
last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire , an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present			0
@entity0 issued an on - air apology and wrote on @entity207 : ' nobody 's trying to steal anyone 's valor			1
' @entity78 , 2005 @entity0 has told several stories about his experiences reporting from @entity77			2
he has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city 's @entity76 – even though the area was n't flooded			0
the accuracy of other @entity78 claims , including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was ‘ overrun ’ with gangs , have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster			0
@entity84 , 2006 in a 2007 interview with @entity229 , @entity0 recalled ' katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter i was riding in ' during a trip to @entity84			0
in fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire ' six miles away '			0
@entity238 , 2006 a @entity240 vet accused @entity0 of lying to skip an event honoring members of the @entity243 so that he could appear on @entity244			0
on the day of the @entity247 event the @entity26 anchor told organizers that a ' pressing engagement ' meant he would n't be able speak at the dinner , but later that evening he appeared in a walk - on role on @entity244 's @entity252 .			1

@entity156 ceo @entity155 said @entity0 had network 's trust
