@entity1 , 46 , says his attempts get planning permission for a barn on his field in @entity16 have been blocked time and again due to opposition from residents living on a nearby estate			1
now the bitter former print manager intends to sell the 20 - acre plot to gypsies , sparking fears the site in @entity26 could become ' a new @entity27 '			1
mr @entity1 has said he would not sell the land to any of his neighbours for ' a million pounds ' , but would accept a fraction of that amount for the ' satisfaction ' of seeing gypsies move in			1
he warned residents on the neighbouring @entity35 estate : ' if you think i 'm a problem , wait ' till a hundred travellers turn up in their caravans '			2
mr @entity1 , a terrier man for the @entity16 farmers and @entity41 , has advertised the sale online and even told residents he plans to take out a full page advertisement in a quarterly magazine aimed at gypsies and travellers			1
much of the row has been played out on @entity49 , with mr @entity1 making his threats on a local community page for the @entity52			1
he warned : ' the land will also be advertised outside of @entity49 , including a full page advert in the @entity55 ’ @entity56 , a magazine for gypsies and travellers which i doubt many of you will get			2
' i have had a couple of offers for the land already but some things in life are more important than money so i will end up taking less just for the satisfaction of watching travellers take over , ' he said			2
exasperated : mr @entity1 has now said he intends to sell 20 acres of his land in @entity26 , @entity16 , to travellers aerial view : the field mr @entity1 plans to sell is highlighted in red on the aerial image , the @entity72 estate is highlighted in blue mr @entity1 's plans have left residents living on the @entity35 estate afraid the land could end up resembling the notorious @entity27 , the six acre plot in @entity82 that was @entity83 's largest illegal traveller camp until residents were evicted in 2011			1
' if you think i 'm a problem , wait ' til a hundred travellers turn up in their caravans ' @entity1 ' it 's a real concern because by publishing the land on the internet and in traveller magazines there 's a real chance that people will turn up and start to live on the land illegally , ' said one woman from the estate , who did not want to be named			1
' once they get here it is almost impossible to get them to move on			0
it ’s happened here before and it ’s happened in @entity16 many times			2
' we do n’t want to live next - door to another @entity27			0
' but mr @entity1 , who bought the site five years ago for £ 100,000 , insists he will the land to his neighbours at any price			1
' i ’ve never wanted to develop the land			0
i just want to graze some animals there , ' he said			0
' but every time i try and do anything with the land they oppose any changes			0
they have made my life hell and now i will sell it to travellers			2
' even if they offered me a million pounds i would not sell it to them			0
but if travellers offered me £ 100,000 , it ’s all theirs , ' he said			0
neighbours : mr @entity1 claims he could not get planning permission for a barn on his field because of opposition from people living on the @entity133 ( above ) blocked : the 46 - year - old has said he would not sell his field to any of his neighbours even if they offered to pay him ' a million pounds ' the land is designated as agricultural , and since the row erupted @entity139 has plastered posters around the site warning against attempting to park caravans in the field			1
the orange posters state ' the stationing of caravans without planning permission ' is banned , as is ' motor car and motorcycle racing ' and the stationing of ' any moveable structure ' without planning permission			0
a spokesman for @entity139 said : ' the landowner can sell his land to whoever he wants			0
' but we are clear this is agricultural land and it is clear what it can and can not be used for			0

@entity1 says neighbours repeatedly *thwarted* his attempts to get permission for a barn on his field in @entity16
