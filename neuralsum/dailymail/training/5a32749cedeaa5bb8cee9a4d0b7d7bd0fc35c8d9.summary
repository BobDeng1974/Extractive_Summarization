i knew if i let myself think of time , then it would cause me extra stress since the whole process took half a day to get to the hospital			2
' so i just focused on remaining calm and keeping my mind either empty or distracted which was the best thing i could do			2

spectacular : @entity5 will stop at nothing to get the perfect picture and suffered multiple injuries while taking these breath - taking extreme paragliding snaps miss @entity5 took to the air on a dual paraglider and flew at a stomach - churning 18,000ft to capture the awesome images ' it 's hard to describe on how far i 'd exactly go as every situation is different though i will continue to keep travelling to the far corners of the globe to bring back incredible images			1
' i 've always believed in trusting my gut instinct			0
if something does n't feel right , then i wo n't do it			0
' while taking pictures at such a high altitude my hands became numb and i thought it was frost bite beginning to come on			0
' i took my hand out of my mittens and began to thrash it around inside my down jacket and as the blood began to rush back into my hand , i experienced ' the screaming barfies ' i wanted to scream as the pain was so intense			0
' the other danger of flying at altitude , and especially spending extended lengths of time at altitude is hypoxia , we flew with oxygen bottles to prevent this from happening			0
' no doubt there is risk in what i do			0
the important thing is to keep yourself as safe as possible and try to take calculated risks but sometimes @entity144 will reign supreme			0
' the injuries i 've sustained have n't put me off one bit though			1
if anything , it 's only inspired me more to keep pursuing what i love to do			0
' i think it 's incredibly important to learn and grow from it rather than letting it destroy you and put you off from your dreams and aspirations			0
' when people ask me what i do for a living , it almost feels strange to say what i do is work because i enjoy it so much			0
