tests for prostate cancer may be incorrectly giving the all - clear to up to 50 per cent of men who have the disease , according to a study			1
experts believe thousands of patients with the disease could be missed every year because the standard biopsy techniques used at most @entity10 hospitals are flawed			1
and thousands more perfectly healthy people could be wrongly diagnosed with the disease and undergoing needless radiotherapy or surgery , according to a study by the @entity15 and @entity16			2
experts say @entity18 and ultrasound scans give more accurate diagnoses of prostate cancer prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men , affecting 40,000 @entity25 men a year and killing 10,000			1
most @entity10 hospitals automatically use biopsies for men with suspected prostate cancer , removing and examining tissue in an attempt to establish whether the disease is present			1
more than 100,000 of these ‘ blind ’ biopsies are carried out every year – but experts say the procedures are inaccurate and risky			2
they are instead calling for less invasive – but far more expensive – @entity18 and ultrasound scans to be used first , which they say could immediately and reliably give the all - clear to men without the disease , and allow doctors to carry out more accurate biopsies by pinpointing the area where a tumour is suspected			1
professor @entity45 , of the @entity16 , told the @entity46 : ‘ there is no other organ of the body where we carry out random “ blind ” biopsies without knowing where we are looking			0
prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men , affecting 40,000 @entity25 men a year and killing 10,000 ( file photo ) ‘ at @entity58 we have been using @entity18 , followed by a guided biopsy for several years , but there are only a handful of hospitals in this country which do this , and that needs to change			1
’ the health economists who carried out the @entity68 - funded study calculated that using the alternative procedure could mean a quarter of patients are given the all - clear without having a biopsy			0
for every 1,000 men with suspected cancer , 250 men could have been reassured after a scan			2
of 500 of the cases in which significant disease was present , just 50 per cent were detected during the traditional biopsy , compared with 68 per cent using the @entity18 - guided technique			0
one in 20 of those undergoing the traditional biopsy were wrongly found to have significant disease levels			0
using the @entity18 - guided technique , around half as many men were given a wrong diagnosis			0
@entity85 , a health economist from @entity15 , said : ‘ these findings suggest that the use of @entity18 and ultrasound not only detects far more cases , but leads to fewer false positives , in which significant disease is wrongly diagnosed			0
’ dr @entity91 , head of research at @entity93 , said : ‘ this early data suggests that giving men an mri scan before a biopsy may put clinicians in a better position to tailor investigations and treatments further down the line			2
' however , further research is necessary before we will know the true value of this method			0

thousands of *sufferers* could be missed every year *due* to ' flawed ' biopsies
experts call for *costly* mri and ultrasound scans to be used instead
