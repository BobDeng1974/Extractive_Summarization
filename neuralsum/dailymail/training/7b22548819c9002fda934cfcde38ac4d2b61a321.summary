so it comes as no surprise that the summer of 2013 has been our warmest , driest and sunniest for seven years , according to the @entity6			1

glorious : four young women enjoy a @entity13 boat ride on what has been the warmest , driest and sunniest summer for seven years , with the heat set to continue into the autumn , according to forecasters hot stuff : while the 19 - day july heatwave stood out as the most striking weather event of the season , a @entity6 report said it was ' more notable for its duration than the actual temperatures recorded ' although temperatures will cool down over the weekend , the mercury could rise to as high as @entity27 ( @entity28 ) in the @entity29 and @entity30 next week			1
the @entity6 has revealed that between june 1 and august 28 , the average temperature in the @entity32 was @entity33 ( @entity34 ) – just under the @entity36 ( 60f ) figure recorded in 2006			2
a total of 189mm of rainfall was measured , 78 per cent of the @entity32 average and half last summer ’s total of 379mm			0
in 2006 , 188.3mm of rain was recorded , along with 601.5 hours of clear sunshine that was not blocked by any cloud			0
that compares to 588 hours this summer , making it the seventh sunniest summertime since 1929			0
trying to keep cool : the @entity6 has revealed that between june 1 and august 28 , the average temperature in the @entity32 was @entity33 ( @entity34 ) - just under the @entity36 ( 60f ) figure recorded in 2006 but in a statement released yesterday , the @entity6 said : ‘ while this summer is warmer , drier and sunnier than the long - term average , it has n’t been exceptional			1
‘ it stands out because the last six summers have been wetter than average , with 2012 and 2007 both being in the top five wettest , and 2008 and 2009 also in the top ten wettest in records from 1910			2
’ and while the 19 - day july heatwave stood out as the most striking weather event of the season , the report said it was ‘ more notable for its duration than the actual temperatures recorded ’			2
the summer ’s highest temperature was not during the heatwave but on august 1 , when the mercury reached @entity65 ( @entity66 ) at @entity67 – the highest in the @entity32 since july 2006			0
@entity6 forecaster @entity68 said : ‘ we ’ve had the kind of summer we should have had , rather than the wet and cooler summers we have suffered in recent years			1
‘ there will be plenty of fine , dry weather for the south and @entity29 next week - certainly warmer than normal for this time of the year			1
it could reach around @entity77 ( @entity78 ) early in the week and perhaps a little warmer later next week			0
' but it will only be a brief sunny interlude , with conditions becoming more unsettled and temperatures back to normal by the end of the week			0
’ the unseasonal temperatures will be caused by an area of high pressure dominating @entity86 and @entity87 which will draw in warmer air from the continent			0
@entity91 forecaster @entity90 predicted temperatures of @entity93 ( @entity94 ) in the @entity29 on wednesday , with the possibility it could go higher the following day			1
she added : ‘ the average temperature for the start of autumn in the @entity29 is @entity99 ( @entity100 ) so it will be a good few degrees higher than average			1
but in the north temperatures could be up to ten degrees lower , much closer to the seasonal average in that part of the country			0
’ the @entity6 said this summer was likely to finish around eighth to tenth warmest since 1910 .			1

@entity109 could rise as high as @entity27 in @entity29 and @entity30 next week
@entity6 says weather only seems good compared to last few wet summers
‘ we ’ve had the kind of summer we should have had , ' says forecaster
