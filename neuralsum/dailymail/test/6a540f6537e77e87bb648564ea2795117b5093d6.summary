the announcement of the @entity70 following the development of software upgrades to make the @entity73 even faster			0
' @entity75 0 to 60mph acceleration will improve by ~ 0.1 sec soon via over-the - air software update to inverter algorithm , ' @entity1 founder @entity74 tweeted earlier this year			0
@entity74 was referring to something known as the ' insane mode ' which allows the car to accelerate from 0 to 60 in a little over three seconds			0
the @entity83 model , unveiled in october has two motors - one powering the front wheels and one powering the rear wheels			2
it has a top speed of 155 mph ( 249 km / h ) , compared with the current 130 mph ( 209 km / h ) on @entity1 's previous s model			0
in @entity92 , the full 691 horsepower of the electric car 's two motors is applied in one go			1
at the launch event , mr @entity74 said the car reaches 60mph in three seconds from a standstill			0
during recent tests of the @entity92 acceleration , also carried out by @entity101 , the car achieved the speed in 3.17 seconds			0

@entity9 runs on 50 kwh lithium - ion battery pack that drives six motors
it produces @entity108 ( 1368 horsepower ) and has a peak torque of 2160 @entity22
car will compete in the @entity7 in @entity112
