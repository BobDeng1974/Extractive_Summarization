interest rates could be cut even further from their already record low of just 0.5 per cent , the @entity0 governor @entity1 revealed this morning			1
the bank chief said the banking system could cope with interest rates being cut closer to zero – but refused to say how far they could fall			1
however , mr @entity1 insisted it was still more likely that rates would go up after inflation returns to normal after a period of falling prices this year			1
@entity0 governor @entity1 said interest could be cut below 0.5 per cent - but it was still more likely that they would rise mr @entity1 this morning insisted the current low inflation was temporary and will return to its 2 per cent target within two years			1
‘ what 's important is that workers and businesses understand this is a temporary phenomena , ’ he told mps			0
the bank chief added : ‘ enjoy it while it lasts because petrol prices are not going to continue to fall			1
food prices are not going to continue to fall			0
’ mr @entity1 said that three - quarters of the current weakness in inflation was due to falling prices of oil and food , which he said was a ‘ temporary , one - off development ’			2
he stressed that if there was any evidence of a sustained fall in inflation , the @entity0 could ‘ if necessary ’ cut interest rates from their current 0.5 per cent low to zero , but he emphasised that the ‘ focus of policy is towards tightening ’			1
he said : ‘ because of the resilience of banking and building societies has increased , we are in a position where we could , if necessary , cut bank rates towards zero			0
that is – to a level that is still above zero – but we have n’t specified a specific level			0
’ mr @entity1 this morning insisted the current low inflation was temporary and will return to its 2 per cent target within two years			1
today 's 0.5 per cent interest rates are already an historic low after soaring to 17 per cent in the 1980s but he said : ‘ we are not having an active discussion about it , because the focus of policy has been towards the timing and degree of tightening where appropriate			2
’ mr @entity1 added : ‘ the bank rate is more likely than not to be higher than it is at present at the end of the forecast period			0
’ the @entity0 's base rate has been at a record low of 0.5 per cent for nearly six years			0
markets are currently expecting an interest rate rise in early 2016			0
however , in written evidence to the @entity67 , @entity68 , one of two members of the @entity70 to have voted to raise interest rates late last year , said it ‘ may be appropriate to raise @entity72 rather earlier than financial markets currently anticipate ’			2
his warning chimed with an earlier speech by @entity70 member @entity78 , who said there were risks to the economy if interest rates remained at their record low rate for too long			2
