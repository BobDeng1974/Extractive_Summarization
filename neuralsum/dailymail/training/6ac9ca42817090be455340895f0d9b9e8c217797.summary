by @entity0 published : 05:15 est , 14 march 2014 updated : 08:58 est , 15 march 2014 @entity2 could make his debut for @entity4 in sunday 's @entity5 at @entity6			1
the 31 - year - old @entity8 international is yet to feature for the @entity9 since he arrived on the final day of the january transfer window			2
@entity2 signed for @entity4 with a back injury , but speaking ahead of his side 's trip to @entity15 , manager @entity12 revealed the midfielder is back in training			1
' @entity2 joined the normal training group on thursday and @entity19 , too , ' said @entity12			1
i will see how he looks			0
' @entity12 however , revealed that @entity29 , who suffered a hamstring injury in the draw at @entity32 earlier this week , could be sidelined for six weeks , while @entity33 , injured in @entity4 's win at @entity35 on @entity36 , faces a prolonged spell away from the first team			1
' @entity29 is injured and we do n't know how long - maybe minimum three weeks , but the maximum is six , ' added @entity12			1
early bath : @entity29 was withdrawn at half - time after suffering a hamstring injury in the opening minutes out of action : @entity33 , pictured at @entity45 last week , faces a further two weeks out of action ' but i 'm not specialist enough to know how long a grade two hamstring is			1
he was handicapped early on and i saw him stretching i asked my physio at the time			0
' @entity33 is a bit apprehensive with his thigh , and he could be out for another two weeks			2
' @entity29 is believed to have injured his hamstring in the opening 10 minutes of the second - leg , last - 16 clash at the @entity58 but carried on playing until half - time and aggravated the problem			1
he was checked by @entity4 ’s medical team during the break and also saw @entity32 ’s @entity64 team doctor @entity63			2
out of action : @entity66 faces two months on the sidelines after injuring his foot in @entity70 's win over @entity71 @entity29 's setback is the latest in a series of serious injuries to senior members of @entity12 's squad			1
@entity66 will miss around two months with a foot injury sustained on international duty last week and @entity79 is out until next season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament			0
' i am concerned because if you look at the list we are missing big players , ' @entity12 said			2
' we are analysing deeply why it has happened and to see if there is a link			0
' some of it is bad luck , but the rest we have to find out why			0
' @entity4 head to @entity6 looking to pull themselves back into the @entity97 title race			1
crashing out : @entity4 lost their last 16 tie despite drawing 1 - 1 st the @entity58 on tuesday night following their @entity100 quarter - final win , the @entity9 hold a match in hand on leaders @entity104 , but are seven points off top spot now down in third place			2
@entity12 is expecting a focused display from his side in what will be a heated atmosphere			0
' it has been always difficult at @entity15 , but we are in a position where of course we want to win the game , because after ( losing at ) @entity118 , it is very important , ' @entity12 said			0
' we had a good result against @entity120 , we had a good result even at @entity32 , but that we continue and have no weak moment any more until the end of the season			0
' @entity12 added : ' it is a difficult ground to go to for everybody			0
we had good and bad memories there , so let 's make sure the good comes out on sunday			0
