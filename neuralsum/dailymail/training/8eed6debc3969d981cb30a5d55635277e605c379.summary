another weekend , another blank for @entity1 in the @entity2			2
the @entity5 side 's long - suffering fans were looking forward to @entity6 when they last saw their side score with league points at stake - @entity10 putting them in front at home to @entity13 on december 20			1
rather depressingly , it was just their 11th league goal of the season and , little did they know , that tally would still be the same in early february			0
@entity1 striker @entity10 cuts a dejected figure during their 5 - 0 loss at @entity21 on sunday @entity22 reacts after @entity1 's thrashing by @entity21 , extending their goal drought to over 10 hours manager @entity25 is under increasing pressure to turn around @entity1 's season @entity1 currently find themselves just three points above the @entity2 drop zone since that 1 - 1 draw with @entity13 , @entity1 have failed to find the target against @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity21			1
sunday 's 5 - 0 thumping at the @entity38 represented a fresh nadir for @entity25 's team and it is hardly going to get any easier - league leaders @entity43 await on saturday			0
their paltry ' goals for ' tally is made to look all the more meagre by the fact there are no fewer than 14 players in @entity50 's leading five divisions that have scored more on their own this season than the entire @entity1 team			1
in the @entity2 , @entity43 's @entity53 ( 17 ) , @entity55 's @entity54 ( 14 ) , @entity57 's @entity56 ( 13 ) and @entity21 's @entity58 ( 12 ) have all surpassed @entity1 's league goals tally			2
@entity43 striker @entity53 has six more goals in league competition than the entire @entity1 side @entity55 striker @entity54 has scored 14 goals in league competition so far this season out in @entity72 , @entity66 star @entity65 ( 28 ) , @entity68 duo @entity67 ( 22 ) and @entity69 ( 15 ) , and @entity71 's @entity70 ( 12 ) all have more			1
in @entity81 's @entity80 , @entity74 of @entity75 ( 13 ) , @entity76 of @entity77 ( 12 ) and @entity78 of @entity79 ( 12 ) have each outscored @entity25 's team			2
in the @entity85 , @entity83 of @entity84 has scored 13 goals to @entity1 's 11			0
and in the @entity92 @entity87 , @entity88 of @entity89 ( 21 ) and @entity90 of @entity91 ( 14 ) have both been more prolific than the @entity93			0
@entity65 has scored 28 goals for @entity66 in @entity95 this season , 17 more than @entity1 's league total @entity68 's @entity67 has double @entity1 's total by himself in just @entity95 matches this campaign @entity74 of @entity75 ( left ) has scored 13 league goals so far this campaign there are also a further six players in those leagues that have 11 goals , the same as @entity1			1
the aforementioned goal drought now stands at 10 hours and 12 minutes ahead of saturday 's @entity43 visit and the infamously poor @entity109 side that played in the @entity2 in 2007 - 08 managed a superior goals - per - game ratio than @entity25 's men are currently trundling along at			1
given all this , it is miraculous @entity1 are n't in the relegation zone			0
but , with a safety margin of just three points at the moment , it may only be a matter of time unless they can find their shooting boots .			0

@entity1 have scored just 11 @entity2 goals in miserable season
they have n't found the net since december 20 against @entity13
their drought now stands at 10 hours and 12 minutes of league action
14 players in @entity50 's leading five leagues have scored more than them
they *include* @entity65 , @entity67 , @entity69 and @entity74
@entity25 's side are just three points above the drop zone
