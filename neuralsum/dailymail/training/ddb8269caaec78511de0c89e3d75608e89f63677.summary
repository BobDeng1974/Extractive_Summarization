by @entity0 tragedy : physics student @entity2 was battling with depression a coroner has urged the sale of helium to be regulated after the son of a top university professor suffocated himself to death with the gas			1
physics student @entity2 , 23 , had been battling depression after struggling to settle at the prestigious @entity13 college of the @entity14 , the coroner at the inquest into his death said he would write to @entity18 , the home secretary , urging her to introduce restrictions on the sale of helium so similar deaths would be avoided in the future			1
while his mother , professor @entity23 , was away on academic business in @entity25 , @entity2 placed an order for the gas			1
he was was found dead in the bedroom of his family ’s £ 250,000 @entity30 townhouse in @entity32 , @entity33			2

a note found near @entity2 read : ' i ca n’t take this anymore			2
it ’s been years since i instigated anything			0
' it also emerged @entity2 was identified as being a suicide risk by a psychiatrist whilst living in student accommodation in @entity47 , but the details were not transferred back to @entity33 where he was referred to a gp			1
but he dropped out twice and saw a psychiatrist in @entity47 before returning to his family home where he began counselling for depression			1
despite his illness , he took up driving lessons and learnt @entity56 ahead of a trip to @entity58 where he planned to help teach physics to young @entity61 students			1
tragedy struck in september last year after @entity2 ’s mother , who is a professor of @entity64 at @entity65 , went on a work expedition to @entity67 and @entity25			1
his family described him as the : ' kindest and most loving spirit with a wicked sense of humour			0
' professor @entity23 , 53 , the former director and chair of the @entity75 charity @entity74 , told the @entity33 hearing : ' he wanted to go to @entity58 with a person who was teaching physics but he wanted to learn to drive before he went because he thought it would be less of a burden			1
' about the end of may he started learning to drive and started learning @entity56			0
he passed his driving theory in july and had the practical test booked up for october and he was talking about going to @entity58 after that			0
' but he was anxious about struggling with depression and not doing very much did n’t help that			2
i wanted him to go sooner but he wanted to pass his test			0
' abroad : @entity2 's mother , professor @entity23 ( right ) , was away in @entity25 when he killed himself she added : ' it ’s difficult to say what he was feeling at certain times because i had some sense he was trying to mislead me and he did n’t want me to think he was depressive or suicidal			1
' i had no idea he had helium in his room but even if i did i would n’t have connected it with a suicide attempt anyway			2
i ’ve never done physics so i would n’t know			2
' we were going to go to @entity100 for a couple of days so he could practice his driving and he was looking forward to it			0
' professor @entity23 said that in hindsight she believes that @entity2 was trying out activities ' one last time			1
' she said : ' he wanted to go to a @entity108 restaurant we were keen on			0
looking back on it he was conscious about wanting to do certain things			0
' now it seems strange that having been identified by his psychiatrist as suicidal to then be started again at the beginning when he got back to @entity33			1
family home : he was was found dead in the bedroom of his family 's £ 250,000 @entity30 townhouse in @entity32 , @entity33			1
' why does n’t one psychiatrist ’s office refer him to a similar department ? i think if the @entity123 had referred him to a similar department and he did n’t feel like he was going back to the start i think he would have presented differently			2
' detective sergeant @entity126 of @entity127 said the note @entity2 wrote was found in between documents on his desk			2
he said police were n’t able to ascertain when the note was written or whether it was directly connected to the death			0
recording a verdict of suicide @entity33 coroner @entity134 said of @entity2 : ' he was clearly a very intelligent young boy with a scientist background and it is inevitable he would understand the consequences of what he did			1
' if @entity2 really had a better understanding of the grief and heartache he would leave behind i am sure he would have thought more than once about this			2
but he is an adult and he did n’t suffer from any diagnosable mental illness			0
he has made a choice			0
' losing one ’s own child is the greatest burden of grief any one of us will have to manage			0
i propose to write to the home secretary and point out this is another case which involves the use of helium			1
' addressing professor @entity23 ’s concerns over the transferral of documents between mental health institutions nationwide , @entity33 coroner @entity134 said : ' this is a big issue because people ca n’t get the records			1
' there is no national database			0
i can write to the trust and explain this concern which is something i ’m going to do			0
