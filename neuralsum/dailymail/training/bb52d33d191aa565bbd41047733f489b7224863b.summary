@entity0 is ready to shoulder extra responsibility at @entity2 with @entity3 ruled out of the @entity5 derby			1
@entity0 , arguably @entity2 ’s best player this season , may be asked by manager @entity8 to play in a more central role with @entity2 missing @entity3 ’s creativity against @entity11 at the @entity12			1
the 28 - year - old has played in nearly every outfield position during his career and would not be daunted by switching from wide to the centre if @entity8 opts for one up front			1
@entity0 may be given a central role in the @entity5 derby after @entity3 was ruled out @entity0 said : ‘ it does n’t bother me where i play — i just want to be in the team			1
but i think my best position is in the middle and if the manager thinks i can do a job there against @entity11 then i ’ll be ready			1
‘ i do n’t know what his thoughts are but i was bought as a central midfielder and i ’ve had a bit more time in there this season , though mainly i have been used wide			1
‘ i ’d rather be in a team with @entity3 than without him			1
he will be a massive loss for us because he is such a great player , ‘ but we have got a strong squad			2
when one top player drops out , another one comes straight in			2
’ @entity3 will miss the @entity5 derby after suffering knee injury in cup defeat by @entity40 @entity0 would have left in the summer had @entity8 let him but he ’s been a regular for club and country this season and is now open to the idea of signing a new contract before his current one expires in the summer			1
‘ i ’d love to stay at @entity2			2
that ’s the bottom line , ’ he revealed			2
‘ this is a club that is winning things , we have great players and the fans have always been great			2
‘ it ’s a no - brainer for me , i would love to sign a new contract			0
we are talking , but there has n’t been an actual contract offer yet			0
‘ obviously i ’d like things to be sorted sooner rather than later , but i ’m not putting a timescale on it			0
at the moment , all i am thinking about is keeping my place in the team			0
‘ you do n’t expect to play every game when you ’re at a club like this , but i wanted more opportunities and the manager has given them to me			1
as one of the senior voices in the dressing - room , @entity0 does n’t hide that this has been an inconsistent start to the season for @entity2			1
@entity2 striker @entity73 takes part in training on saturday they have already lost four times in all competitions and trail @entity79 in the @entity80			0
‘ we know we ’ve let our standards slip in the last couple of weeks but it has n’t been because of a lack of effort , ’ he said			0
‘ we have spoken about it as a group			0
we ’re quite harsh in the way we criticise ourselves			0
we do n’t hide behind excuses			0
‘ there is such a long way to go and we certainly do n’t feel that anything has been won or lost yet in terms of the @entity80			0
‘ this is a big game for us — but it ’s a big game for @entity11 as well — and it ’s true what they say that sometimes form counts for nothing			0
if you ca n’t get yourself up for a @entity5 derby then you ’re in trouble			1
