by @entity0 published : 11:36 est , 3 april 2012 updated : 11:36 est , 3 april 2012 in the future , robots could be ' printed off ' in an @entity4 - style revolution which could bring robot servants into every home			1
a new £ 6.25 million science project aims to speed up the creation of robots so the machines become more like @entity12 kits - or @entity14 furniture			1
ordering a robot could be as simple as buying a new chest of drawers - and a fully customised machine would be ready within 24 hours			0
' i 'm sure i ordered a @entity20 ' : new ' kit ' robots could mean that home servants will be able to be ordered , assembled and ready for work in 24 hours it 's uncertain whether the team 's robotic servants will have the camp , otherworldly charm of @entity30 and @entity31 home users would simply list the tasks they need their new robo - jeeves to handle , then a website would suggest which abilities their robots would need			1
the scientists behind the project have not speculated on how much our new robot servants might cost			1
researchers in the @entity43 have launched a project aimed at developing desk - top technology that will make household robots as commonplace as flatpack furniture			1
the key to the process is 3 - d printing , the automated manufacture of plastic and metal machine components from a set of instructions			0
scientists hope to create a platform that will enable people to choose from a ‘ library ’ of robot designs			1
once a particular problem is identified , the householder would choose from a selection of robot blueprints			0
the programme would allow a fully functioning customised robot to be assembled and ready for action within 24 hours			0
‘ our goal is to develop technology that enables anyone to manufacture their own customised robot , ’ said professor @entity68 , one of the researchers from the @entity70			0
‘ this is truly a game - changer			0
’ @entity68 's laboratory specialises in robots that operates in teams , and famously created a team of ' quadrotor ' flying robots which played the @entity83 theme			2
incredible : the flying robots are shown hovering over their individual keys , ready to press them in time currently it takes years to design , produce and programme a fully functioning robot			2
the process is costly , involving hardware and software design , machine learning and vision , and advanced programming techniques			0
the new technology would fully automate production , allowing individuals to build functioning robots from materials as easily accessible as a sheet of paper			2
a $ 10 million ( £ 6.25 million ) grant from the @entity105 is funding the five - year project			1
crash ! one robot 's job was to hover over a drum and bash it in time to the music team leader professor @entity113 , from the @entity115 's @entity114 and @entity116 ( @entity117 ) , said : ‘ this research envisions a whole new way of thinking about the design and manufacturing of robots , and could have a profound impact on society			1
‘ we believe that it has the potential to transform manufacturing and to democratise access to robots			2
’ so far prototype machines have been used to produce an insect - like robot for exploring contaminated areas , and a gripper designed to help disabled people			0
‘ it 's really exciting to think about the kind of impact this work could have on the general population , beyond just a few select people who work in robotics , ’ said dr @entity136 , also from @entity117 .			0
