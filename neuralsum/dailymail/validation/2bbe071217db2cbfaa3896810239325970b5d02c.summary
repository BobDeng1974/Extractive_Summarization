after a 14 - hour operation to remove the tumour , she said : ' @entity16 bottle saved my life			1
' had i not opened it with my teeth , i would not be here			2
' i 've lost my looks and feel disfigured			2
people stare at me in the street but i 'm alive and i can watch my kids grow up , so it 's a small price to pay			2
' now i want others to be more aware of mouth cancer - because i had never even heard of it			1

' i was cross with myself because my teeth had been weak since my last pregnancy			0
i spat the tooth into the sink and made an appointment to see the dentist in three weeks ' time			1

she said : ' when i woke up i felt like i 'd been in the boxing ring ' ' he said i could be dead within weeks			0
the first thing i thought about was my kids and who would look after them if i died			0

all i could think about was not being alive to do these things with them			0
' my two older kids needed me too , so i knew i had to be strong			0
as well as being mother to @entity54 , six and @entity53 , two , ms @entity1 , a single mother , has two older children , @entity164 , 14 , and @entity165 , 12 , who live with their father			1

' @entity172 and @entity173 scans were arranged to see how far the cancer had spread - and there was bad news when a biopsy through her revealed a golf ball sized tumour under her nose and cheek			1
ms @entity1 was horrifed to be told that had she gone another six to eight weeks without treatment , she would have died			1

it was so shocking because i 'd felt so well			0

' during the operation surgeons removed most of ms @entity1 's cheekbone and palate , then used tissue from her thigh to rebuild her face			1
she said : ' when i woke up i felt like i 'd been in the boxing ring			0
my whole face throbbed with pain			2
' i asked for a mirror straight away and the nurses hesitated but i needed to know how i looked			0

that broke my heart — she was scared of her own mummy			2
' @entity54 asked if my face would ever go back to normal and i had to explain that even though i looked different on the outside , i would still be the same mummy on the inside			1
' he just shrugged and said " i know " and jumped on to my lap for a cuddle			0
' ms @entity1 ( pictured before surgery ) says she now avoids looking in the mirror			1
' my confidence has gone but it 's a small price to pay			2
