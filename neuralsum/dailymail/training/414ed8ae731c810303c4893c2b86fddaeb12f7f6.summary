by @entity0 published : 07:26 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 12:33 est , 19 september 2013 the @entity1 this year has two big stars , @entity4 's @entity3 and the @entity5			0
but with huge numbers of young , barely dressed models also in attendance , game fans may well find their gaze drawn elsewhere			2
@entity12 's largest video game expo kicked off today at @entity13 in @entity14 , east of @entity15 , with a record number of games developers taking part			1
and judging by these pictures , they have brought with them record numbers of scantily - clad young women , leading to scenes reminiscent of a @entity26 - era car show			1
others were provocatively styled as cro - top - wearing , cleavage - baring schoolgirls , complete with the knee socks and tartan skirts more typically associated with @entity52 school uniforms			1
the contrast with the show 's visitors - mostly conservatively dressed men - offers an apt reminder of why the computer entertainment industry is under attack for its representation of women			1
but such debates were quite clearly off the cards at today 's event , where most attention was directed at the eagerly awaited new offerings from @entity4 and @entity67			2
in a reversal of the old order , both the @entity3 and the @entity5 are to go on sale first in the @entity71 and @entity72 in november , far ahead of expected @entity52 release dates slated for next year			2
@entity4 and @entity67 both say tailoring the machines for the @entity52 market takes more time but many in the gaming world see the delay as symbolic of @entity52 's loss of its pioneering and leading role in the industry			1
fancy dress : a model poses , left , dressed as a character from the game @entity88			0
the pair on the right are dressed as characters from @entity93 's @entity92 game geeks ' fantasy : two models brandish models of oversized video game - style weapons at a stand at the show not in the least bit distracted : a visitor plays video games on tablet cushion called @entity106 , while @entity106 's campaign model plays in front of him dressed in a leather playsuit with eyes on a comeback , this year 's show has a renewed focus this year on independent game software developers			1
game insiders and experts say that encouraging a new breed of game creators is crucial for @entity52 to regain its status in the game world , ceded over the years to the @entity71 and @entity72 where startups face fewer obstacles			1
it 's felt that the broader stagnation witnessed in the @entity52 economy also infected the game world , where big success was followed by complacency , and even a stifling of newcomers			1
a presentation by @entity4 executives today signalled this fresh attempt to woo independent developers			2
flashed on a giant screen was the slogan made up of the words ' ps , ' which stands for @entity3 , and ' indies , ' with a big red heart mark in the middle			0
' we are welcoming the contributions of independent developers , ' said @entity145 , senior vice president at @entity146 , the @entity15 - based electronics and entertainment giant 's game division			1
save me ! a campaign model poses in the clutches of a sculpture of a robot character from an @entity5 game at @entity67 's stand , which is one of the biggest at the show the @entity5 is displayed on a screen : along with @entity4 's @entity3 , the latest xbox is one of the stars of the show , which is the biggest of its kind in @entity12 @entity166 game producer @entity164 believes @entity52 must first recognise its failure before it can move on , as most have become too comfortable and set in their ways , resting on the laurels of past success			1
still worse , they have grown cautious , and churn out sequels of the old formulas , instead of taking risks , he said			0
' suddenly , @entity52 games were n't selling , and they did n't look as good as they used to look , compared to foreign games , ' he told @entity178			2
' we need to first confront our own defeat , and we need to start learning from the world			0
' previously a star creative at @entity183 , where over a sparkling three - decade career he was behind such hits as @entity186 and @entity187 , mr @entity164 started his own game company @entity189 three years ago			2
he says he is determined to show @entity52 is ready to reinvent itself			1
' @entity52 is going to rise again to the top , ' he said at his @entity189 office in @entity15			0
' we have to go back to our roots and rediscover what made @entity52 great			0
' visitors play a @entity197 strategy game : most of those actually attending the show on its preview day today appeared to be men visitors play @entity202 : the @entity204 video game for @entity4 's @entity3 : the @entity3 goes on sale in @entity52 in late february - three months after its release in the @entity207 both @entity4 and @entity67 insist the delay in the @entity52 launch of their machines is to give more time for preparation			1
the @entity3 , which goes on sale on november 15 in the @entity71 and @entity215 , and on november 29 in @entity72 , goes on sale in @entity52 on february 22 , 2014 - the first time a major @entity4 console is not going on sale first in @entity52			2
@entity5 also is n't set to go on sale in @entity52 until next year although its global launch is set for november 22			0
no date for the @entity52 sale is being announced			0
@entity222 , corporate vice president at @entity223 , says tailoring @entity5 for the @entity52 market is taking more time , such as making sure the voice recognition feature works and signing on partnerships for local content			0
but he denied the importance of @entity52 was diminishing for @entity67 , and stressed more software titles were in the works for @entity5 , including ' @entity231 ' from star developer @entity232			0
instead , he said the changes were more about a growing diversity in types of games because they were being played on smartphones and tablets , as well as consoles			0
' the creative capability here is without match , ' said mr @entity222 .			0

@entity12 's largest video game show kicked off in @entity52 today
it has a record number of exhibitors - who seem to have brought a record number of models along with them
but it comes as the @entity52 industry is in *crisis* and losing ground to @entity259 developers
