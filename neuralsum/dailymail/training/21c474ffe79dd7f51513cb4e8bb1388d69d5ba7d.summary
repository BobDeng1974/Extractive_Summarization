by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 vows not to bite that hand that feeds him if @entity4 delivers on his promise of a place in the opposite corner for one of his mega-million - dollar super fights next year			1
@entity11 ’s would - be successor to the throne of the mythical dominion of the greatest pound - for - pound fighter in the world watched in the same dismay and disgust as the rest of us as @entity20 sank his teeth into the @entity23 puzzle of a genius for whom he could find no solution			1
on the night the spectre of @entity29 moved from the @entity31 playing field to the @entity32 , @entity2 made no bones about what the punishment should be for any sportsman who resorts to such cannibal desperation			1
@entity4 ( right ) confronts @entity20 ( left ) about the alleged bite @entity4 ( right ) was a clear and deserved winner over the @entity40 @entity20 ( left ) @entity4 ( centre ) celebrates a unanimous points victory over @entity20 in @entity32 he said : ‘ when you do that you should never be allowed in the boxing ring again , because you ’re risking someone ’s life			1
’ @entity2 held out his clenched fists and said : ‘ these are our tools and we need them ( to survive )			1
’ by distasteful – in every sense - irony , @entity2 was sitting next to the villain and the victim of the ring ’s most infamous biting incident			1
when @entity55 gnawed a chunk out of @entity58 ’s ear he was pilloried for defacing not only his heavyweight nemesis but the hard old game itself - and @entity2 knows that boxing will be damaged by @entity20 ’s aberration			1
he says : ‘ it shames the sport			0
getting frustrated can happen to anyone but this is not the way to deal with it			0
i ’m mentally strong and i would never do anything like that			0
it is important to respect your sport and each other			0
’ it is also gruesome ingratitude for being given the chance to make a small fortune			0
@entity20 ( centre ) is $ 5 million better off after his two fights with @entity4 @entity4 was shaken by a blow to his head late in the third round while others more deserving – notably @entity2 and @entity85 – are kept interminably waiting , @entity20 has been granted two of these @entity89 opportunities for wealth and fame within four months			1
each time he has discovered that being the @entity92 from the @entity40 pampas is not enough to unseat he who is both maestro of self defence and magical conjuror of the counter-attack			0
despite being some five million dollars better off after attending this pair of master classes , @entity20 is in denial			2
‘ no , no , ’ he protested , despite being shown he video of him chomping away			0
‘ i did n’t bite him			2
’ but it was also reminiscent of @entity29 , another @entity103 with cannibal tendencies as he had added : ‘ maybe he put his glove in mouth			1
perhaps he thinks i ’m a dog			0
’ @entity4 had no doubts about what was done to his left hand in the eighth round at the @entity113 : ‘ at first i did n’t know what had happened			2
then i realised that he bit me			0
three of my fingers went numb			0
one of them busted open where he bit me through the glove			2
i could n’t feel those fingers for the rest of the fight and could only use the other hand properly			0
’ video : @entity4 claims that @entity20 ' bit through three of my fingers			1
' referee @entity128 found for @entity4 , issuing dire warnings to the @entity131 corner before he allowed the fight to continue			2
@entity128 also deducted a point from @entity131 for twice throwing @entity4 to the canvas in a manner more befitting a wrestling match			2
even so @entity20 took issue with the three other officials , saying : ‘ i won the fight but if the judges want to give it to the man who ran away then good luck to them			2
’ for what it ’s worth , my card concurred with the two who scored @entity4 the winner by 116 points to 111			1
the other made it 115 - 12			2
it may even be that we all short - changed an artist who confounded those who feared that his legs were aging and his reflexes slowing			0
@entity2 ( left ) watched the fight with @entity55 ( right ) in @entity32 on saturday night @entity161 would have been proud of some of his footwork , while his elusive head and body movement kept @entity20 missing like a drunk in a bar brawl			1
@entity2 did not see it that way , saying : ‘ @entity4 is looking older and he is slowing down			1
i do n’t want just to fight him for the money , i want to beat him			0
my speed would do for him now			0
’ @entity4 ’s saturday night victory keeps alive the hope of @entity2 being given the chance to go for a place in history as the first to beat the @entity178 man , who said ; ‘ he ’s competitive and a good fighter so let ’s see if it can happen			1
’ even more importantly in the eyes of the wider world , it revives the possibility of @entity4 finally meeting @entity85 in a long - awaited $ 300 million fight of the century			1
@entity4 said : ‘ i ’ll talk to my team about what the future holds and if a @entity85 fight can be done let ’s make it happen			1
’ given his past reluctance to so much as mention the @entity85 by name , this is cause for optimism that the obstacles dividing promoters and television companies can be overcome			2
quite when that might be is unclear			0
the arduous preparations for fights of this magnitude take their toll of a 37 - year - old and @entity4 hinted that he may pass on his next proposed date – next may – and give his body a full year to recover			1
‘ there ’s no rush , is there ? ’ he asked his @entity211 television paymasters			0
not for himself economically as he prepares to pocket at least $ 32 million from this fourth instalment of a six - fight contract with that pay - per - view network worth a minimum of $ 250 million in total			0
@entity4 ’s independence as well as @entity219 ’s was celebrated this holiday weekend by the 47th victory of his illustrious , still undefeated career			2
@entity20 ( right ) was deducted a point for shoving @entity4 ( left ) to the ground @entity4 ( right ) looks incredulously at @entity20 has he raises his arms at the end of the fight @entity20 ( right ) roughs @entity4 ( left ) up by rubbing his arm in the @entity103 's face it was achieved by bewildering @entity20 and then punishing him for those wild misses with a whole variety of laser - accurate punches – the more debilitating of them to the body - which became more wounding as the 12 rounds unfolded			1
so bemused was the challenger for all those welterweight and light - middleweight belts which were on the line that twice at the end of rounds @entity20 wandered off towards the wrong corner			1
on the second occasion @entity4 turned back to redirect him , like a traffic cop			2
that was a first for me in all these years covering boxers and the champion was amused : ‘ boxing ’s a hard business but it ’s important to keep a sense of humour			0
’ the joke was lost on @entity131			0
but then this is not just sport ’s year of the biter … …			0
. but of the biter well and truly bit			0
video : watch @entity20 's @entity29 - like bite on @entity4			1

@entity4 beat @entity20 on a unanimous points *decision*
@entity20 appeared to bite the glove of @entity4 , in a *bizarre* incident not *dissimilar* to the @entity29 incident at the @entity31
@entity2 is hopeful of facing @entity4 in the future
@entity4 , despite appearing keen on fighting @entity2 , also hinted that a long - awaited bout with @entity85 could be on the cards
