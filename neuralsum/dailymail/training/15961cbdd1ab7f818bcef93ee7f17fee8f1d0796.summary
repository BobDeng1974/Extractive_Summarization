by @entity0 @entity4 ’s comet - chasing @entity2 spacecraft is nearing the most important stage of its mission as it prepares to become the first probe to orbit a comet			1
it is now just 27,000 miles ( 43,000 km ) away from @entity11 , with its arrival scheduled in the coming weeks			0
and by 6 august controllers at @entity4 hope that @entity2 will have entered orbit , while a few months later it will unleash the @entity17 lander onto the surface - the first such landing ever attempted			1
@entity4 ’s @entity2 spacecraft is now within 27,000 miles ( 43,000 kilometres ) of its comet target			1
in this series of images , taken by @entity2 ’s scientific imaging system @entity27 in late june , the @entity23 can be seen to be rotating , giving the first tantalising hints of its shape			1
it completes one rotation in just over 12 hours ‘ @entity2 completed the fifth in a series of ten rendezvous manoeuvres required to ensure the spacecraft ’s arrival at the comet on 6 august , ’ said @entity4 in a blog post announcing the spacecraft ’s close approach			1
@entity2 , named after a block of stone that helped archeologists decipher ancient @entity46 hieroglyphs , will seek to help scientists unlock the composition of comets and thereby understand more about the origins and evolution of our solar system			0
the probe was launched in 2004 and has since travelled around the sun five times , picking up energy from @entity58 and @entity59 to line it up with its final destination : @entity62 – @entity63			0
for the coldest , loneliest leg of the mission , as @entity2 travelled out towards the orbit of @entity66 , the spacecraft was put into deep - space hibernation			1
@entity2 will enter orbit around the comet in august , before putting its @entity17 lander onto the comet ’s surface in november			1
while in orbit it will perform extensive analysis of the comet 's composition , which will provide us with an insight into the history of the solar system and discover the origin of comets			2
@entity2 is firing its thrusters to cut by almost two thirds the speed with which it 's hurtling towards the comet			2
the agency says wednesday 's burn is the first of four before @entity2 comes within 62 miles ( 100 kilometers ) of the comet in early august , beyond the orbit of @entity59			1
the final rendezvous requires two more precision maneuvers			0
the probe , launched a decade ago , will spend time observing @entity98 before dropping a lander onto its icy surface in november			2
the comet is about 2.5 miles ( four km ) long and orbits the @entity102 every six - and - a - half years			0
once at the comet @entity2 will follow it on its journey around the sun , performing extensive studies of the coma and the surface			2
and in november it will release the @entity17 lander , which if successful will be the first vehicle ever to land on a comet			2
the spacecraft 's speed will be slowed in order to remain in orbit , bringing it to roughly about walking pace relative to the comet			1
the @entity2 spacecraft launched in 2004 on a mission to study comet @entity121 ( artist 's illustration shown )			1
it will rendezvous with the comet later this month before entering orbit in august , becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet in november of this year the @entity17 lander will be sent to touch down on the surface of the comet ( artist 's illustration shown ) , which will be the first landing ever performed on a comet			1
here , harpoons will be fired into the surface to keep it anchored while it studies its surroundings the comet is heading towards the sun , so as it nears the star it will begin to melt more			0
even though it is still more than 370 million miles ( 600 million kilometres ) from the sun - more than four times the distance between @entity58 and sun - its surface has already started to warm , causing its ices to turn to gas and escape from its rock - ice nucleus			0
as the gas escapes , it also carries a cloud of tiny dust particles out into space , which slowly expands to create the coma			0
the warming will continue as the comet moves closer to the sun and activity rises , and pressure from the solar wind will eventually cause some of the material to stream out into a long tail			0
this will give @entity2 some fascinating opportunities to observe the comet 's emissions and find out more about its composition			2
@entity2 and the comet will be closest to the sun in august 2015 , when they will be between the orbits of @entity58 and @entity59			0
on 25 feb 2007 the @entity2 spacecraft returned this stunning image of @entity59 as it flew past the red planet on its way to the comet			1
the picture was taken by an imaging instrument on the @entity17 lander at a distance of 620 miles ( 1,000 kilometres )			0
below the solar array an area close to the @entity181 region is visible on the planet 's disk			0

@entity4 's @entity2 spacecraft is getting ready to rendezvous with its target
the @entity191 - *based* agency 's spacecraft will enter orbit at the start of august
a series of new images taken by the probe show the comet rotating
@entity2 's relative speed will slow to about walking pace to enter orbit
here it will study the icy rock to learn more about how comets formed
and in november it will also release a lander onto its surface , which will become the first comet - landing ever attempted
