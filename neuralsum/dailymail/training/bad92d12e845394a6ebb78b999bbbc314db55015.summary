by @entity0 @entity2 chancellor @entity1 last night threw her weight behind @entity4 to be appointed @entity6 president @entity1 last night left @entity7 cut adrift in his fight to stop an arch - federalist seizing control of the @entity6			1
the @entity2 chancellor threw her weight behind former @entity12 prime minister @entity4 to be appointed @entity6 president , despite mr @entity7 ’s view that his opposition to reform is unacceptable to @entity16			1
@entity17 confirmed mr @entity7 will force a vote on mr @entity4 tomorrow at an @entity20 summit in @entity21 – the first time one has been held on the appointment of an @entity20 chief – but signalled he will respect the outcome			1
mrs @entity1 , who told @entity2 mps it would be ‘ no great drama ’ if mr @entity7 is left isolated , was facing accusations of duplicity last night following reports that she had assured the pm last year that she would help him block mr @entity4			1
a @entity21 source said : ‘ it ’s not just that she changed her mind			0
@entity16 is upset because @entity1 actively pressured @entity7 ’s allies to switch sides			2
’ with the possible exception of @entity37 , mr @entity7 appears to have no remaining support – leaving him facing a humiliating defeat at tomorrow ’s vote			1
@entity43 prime minister @entity42 , formerly one of mr @entity7 ’s few allies on the issue , also announced yesterday that he will not now vote to block mr @entity4 ’s appointment as president of the @entity6			1
@entity16 has no veto on the issue and , with the possible exception of @entity37 , appears to have no remaining allies – holding out the prospect of a humiliating defeat for mr @entity7 tomorrow			2
mrs @entity1 was facing accusations of duplicity last night , following reports that she had assured @entity7 , pictured left , that she would help him block the former @entity12 prime minster from the top position but the prime minister – who is said to have warned mrs @entity1 that mr @entity4 is ‘ a face from the @entity60 who can not solve the problems of the next five years ’ – told the @entity63 yesterday he would take the fight against mr @entity4 ‘ all the way to the end ’			1
yesterday , mr @entity4 said he was confident of securing the post but , in an apparent dig at mr @entity7 , was being forced to wait because common sense was ‘ very unequally distributed ’			1
two pro-eu cabinet ministers yesterday rounded on mr @entity7 over his public campaign to block mr @entity4 , warning it risked damaging @entity16 ’s wider relations with @entity74			1
@entity76 veteran @entity75 said the row was ‘ out of all proportion ’ to the threat posed by mr @entity4 , who he said was ‘ not an arch - villain ’			2
‘ no one knows what he ’s supposed to have done wrong , ’ he said			0
‘ the idea he ’s an arch - federalist , a sort of public enemy number one which the media have made him in the last few days flat , is slightly exaggerated			0
’ business secretary @entity90 also criticised mr @entity7 ’s approach , saying : ‘ it has n’t been good for @entity7			2
mr @entity7 warned he would take the fight against mr @entity4 ' all the way to the end ' ‘ i think he was right to take the position he did , but the way it ’s been done , unfortunately , has not helped @entity16 punch its weight in @entity74			1
’ in an arch response to mr @entity90 ’s comments , mr @entity7 ’s official spokesman said : ‘ we ’re always grateful for advice , particularly 24 hours before a summit			2
’ but a @entity106 poll for the @entity107 yesterday suggested voters believe mr @entity7 is right to try to block mr @entity4 ’s appointment			1
some 43 per cent said he had taken the right stance , with just 13 per cent saying he was wrong			0
mrs @entity1 and mr @entity42 both last night telephoned mr @entity7 to urge him to drop plans to force a vote on mr @entity4 when @entity20 leaders meet to discuss the issue tomorrow			1
@entity17 said that , despite the row , the pair had ‘ underlined their support for @entity16 ’s continued membership of a reformed @entity20 and their ongoing commitment to working with the prime minister as he renegotiates @entity16 ’s relationship with the @entity20 ’			2
number 10 also confirmed that mr @entity7 will force a vote – the first time one has ever been held on the appointment of an @entity20 chief – but signalled he will respect the outcome			2
meanwhile , the @entity129 treasury chief secretary @entity128 reopened the row over the potential cost of @entity16 leaving the @entity20 by claiming new @entity133 figures showed more than three million jobs would be put at risk			0
mr @entity128 , who once led the pr campaign for @entity16 to join the euro , said a new ‘ treasury analysis ’ revealed that 3.3 million jobs are ‘ connected to @entity16 ’s place in @entity74 ’			0
in a speech in @entity142 , he added : ‘ that is the measure of the risk that isolationists would have us take			0
’ @entity76 sources last night dismissed the analysis , saying it was a ‘ dusting down ’ of previous , discredited figures			0
the @entity133 declined to publish details of the analysis referred to by mr @entity128			0
former @entity76 cabinet minister @entity153 yesterday dismissed mr @entity128 ’s claim as a ‘ lie ’			0
mr @entity153 said it appeared to be a ‘ rehash ’ of previous claims , adding : ‘ if the @entity16 left the @entity20 there would be a trade deal - as the rest of the @entity20 has always accepted - because they sell us more than we sell them			0
‘ the claim that three million jobs would go is not news – it is not even interesting old news			0
it is simply a lie			0
