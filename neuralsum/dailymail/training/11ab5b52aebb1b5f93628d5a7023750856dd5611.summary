by @entity0 last updated at 5:45 pm on 19th january 2012 the future of the world 's timekeeping could be set to change if a @entity5 led coalition is able to force through a proposal to abolish the leap seconds that keep clocks in line with the @entity11 's rotation			1
currently an extra second is added every few years to keep the time measured by atomic clocks synchronised with time as measured by the position of the sun in the sky			2
but there are now calls for these leap seconds to be abolished in favour of a man - made standard of time some say is more precise in an electronic age			1
delegates to the @entity24 have set their alarms for the beginning of a meeting in @entity28 , @entity29 , this afternoon where the proposals will be debated			0
under threat : the @entity5 wants to move to a new man - made standard of time that disregards the position of the sun in the sky , rendering sundials useless opponents , including experts from the @entity41 and @entity42 , say such a change would mean time shifting out of sync with people 's everyday experience of night and day			1
@entity48 , minister of state for universities and science , told the @entity50 : ' the @entity41 position is that we should stick to the current system used throughout the world			0
' without leap seconds we will eventually lose the link between time and people 's everyday experience of day and night			1
' coordinated @entity60 ( @entity61 ) has , since the @entity67 , been the agreed universal standard which dictates what time it is in every time zone on the planet			0
@entity61 is kept by averaging the time from 400 atomic clocks on earth and sometimes differs from time dictated by day and night , due to fluctuations in earth 's rotation			1
atomic clocks measure time to incredibly precise accuracy by measuring vibrations caused by the decay of radioactive particles to count the seconds			2
the speed of the @entity11 's rotation varies , however , meaning that while one rotation is one day , some days are a few milliseconds longer or shorter than others			1
scientists allow for these fluctuations by adding leap seconds roughly every year - and - a - half to keep @entity61 synchronised with our traditional , sun - based concept of time			1
they are added once the @entity92 , which monitors the planet 's activity , finds the two measurements of time have drifted apart by 0.9 seconds			2
outdated : supporters of the reforms say that a man - made absolute time system would be more useful in an age of gps and electronic communication but that tiny difference could be disastrous , according to dr @entity105 , head of the time department at @entity107 in @entity108			1
the @entity110 - based bureau aggregates the readings from atomic clocks worldwide and issues the results to timekeepers around the world			0
dr @entity116 told the @entity117 last month : ' it is vital for global navigation satellite systems such as @entity102 to have a continuous time scale , not @entity61 with its leap seconds			1
' that means there is a 15 - second difference between @entity61 and the time gps uses			2
someone who is unaware of this could make a tragic mistake when landing an aircraft , for instance			0
' ' and a one - second difference in the communication between stock exchanges could provoke a gain or loss of millions of dollars			0
' but supporters of leap seconds , like @entity139 , senior researcher in time and frequency at the @entity142 , @entity143 , say the problems they cause do not justify getting rid of them			1
he told the @entity50 abolishing them would be ' perhaps the most fundamental change to timekeeping for hundreds of years			0
' ' for the first time , civil time worldwide would be based purely on man - made clocks and no longer tied closely to the @entity11 's rotation , ' he said			1
@entity152 : the position in the sun in the sky has , for millenia , been mankind 's established method of determining the time as a result of such a discrepancy in just a few decades the difference between @entity11 - based time and atomic clock time would amount to several minutes			2
over 500 years the two standards of time would be out by as much as an hour			0
over millenia , the discrepancy could grow to such an extent midday would fall in the middle of the night			0
it is not the first time the @entity5 has campaigned against leap seconds			1
in 2005 @entity5 experts proposed that they be replaced with a leap hour , but @entity24 members rejected the plan			2
if agreement over the time keeping proposal can not be reached among the @entity24 's 200 member states , the issue will go to a vote			0
a 70 per cent majority would be needed for leap seconds to be abolished			2
if they are , the change would come into force from january 1 , 2018			0
â–ˆ the @entity41 's atomic clock , based at the @entity142 , @entity143 , has been judged to be the most accurate in the world			0
@entity5 researchers from @entity192 last summer found it would n't stray by more than a second in 138million years .			0

leap seconds added to allow for @entity11 's rotation
@entity5 - led coalition wants shift to man - made time
change could see midday come at nighttime
