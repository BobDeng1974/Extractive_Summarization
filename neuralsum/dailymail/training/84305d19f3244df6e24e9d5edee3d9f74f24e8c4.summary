@entity0 to worry about ? ! ear lobe surgery is on the rise first there were cankles			0
then there was back fat			0
last week we were told about swoobs , mere moments after we 'd come to terms with our big fat thutts			0
but it seems the beauty industry has n't yet run out of body parts they want to make us hate , then yearn to rip up and rebuild , stuffed full of collagen and @entity18			0
well , not quite yet			0
and the object of their contempt now ? our poor little earlobes			1
yes , try as they might to hide way up high behind hair and earrings , even these adorably plump dinky danglers are not safe from the surgeon 's knife			1
while most of us probably had n't noticed our ears dangling lower than usual ( or ever considered it much of a problem ) , cosmetic clinics are adamant that as we age our earlobes can begin to sag and grow longer , developing wrinkles and creases			1
and luckily for us girls , experts say this condition is generally only present in females , and is often made worse by the use of earrings over the years			2
however , with ear accessories such as the use of stretching tapers growing ever more popular with men , there is an increasing number of cases of male earlobe droop			0
one clinic is even offering an earlobe rejuvenation treatment , claiming that with the application of dermal fillers such as @entity54 and @entity55 you can now ' revolumise and restore your earlobes to give them a more youthful looking appearance '			1
experts use a hyaluronic filler , such as @entity62 , @entity63 or @entity55 , to create this tissue - expanding earlobe effect			0
and while @entity18 notoriously wears off after about four months , the clinic claims that the use of dermal filler in the earlobe tightens the lobe for far longer than when used in other areas , mainly due to the lack of wear and tear or any muscle movement in the area being treated			1
regency aesthetics in @entity76 offer the £ 195 treatment , and describe it as the ideal ' lunch - time earlobe lift ' - and proclaim you can , thank goodness , even wear your earrings immediately after treatment with no swelling or bruising			1
speaking about the new treatment , dr @entity84 said : ' women come to us to subtly enhance their look and opting for treatments such as @entity90 enables them to give the appearance of true youth in the places that matter			1
' time to ditch the bling ? experts say this condition is generally only present in females and is often made worse by the use of earrings over the years , especially big , heavy ones favoured by the likes of @entity102 body image and wellbeing expert @entity103 of @entity105 said : ' i 'd love to think that this is some kind of practical joke thrown out by the beauty industry , but it 's nowhere near @entity111 yet - so i can only assume this is real			2
' it 's comical , really - unless anyone actually falls for it			0
every time these cynical surgical types - who are quite clearly looking to make a quick buck out of people 's insecurities - publicise a treatment like this , they 're just perpetuating a " perfection at all costs " myth , and making people think negatively about a part of their body that nobody should ever , ever worry about			2
' when i 'm trying to work out how to show my true youth in a place that matters , i can safely say my earlobes are ( and should be ) categorically the bottom of the list			2
' it 's absolutely ridiculous , and i hope people see it that way - and spend their lunch times having a bite to eat , rather than an over-priced , ridiculous beauty treatment ! '			2
how bizarre : while it 's most common among women , trends such as stretching tapers , left , have made earlobe droop more common in men			1
in some countries like @entity151 , elongated earlobes are revered			0

@entity90 sagging is most common in women , particularly who wear earrings
@entity90 treatment uses dermal fillers
claims to ' revolumise and restore earlobes to give them a youthful look '
regency aesthetics offer the treatment for £ 195
