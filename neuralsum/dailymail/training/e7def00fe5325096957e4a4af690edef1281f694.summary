forget everything you learned about volcanoes in your geography class			0
the textbook explanation of magma being spewed out from narrow jets deep within @entity7 is wrong , according to a new study			0
researchers now believe that these narrow jets â€“ called mantle plumes - do n't exist , and they say basic physics can back up their findings			1
but scientists now believe this theory is incorrect ' mantle plumes have never had a sound physical or logical basis , ' said @entity26 , a professor at the @entity27			1
according to current mantle - plume theory , heat from @entity7 's core somehow generates narrow jets of hot magma that gush through the mantle and to the surface			1
they have been assumed to exist , originating near where the @entity7 's core meets the mantle , almost 1,860 miles ( 3,000km ) underground - nearly halfway towards the planet 's centre			1
while the top of the mantle is a type of fluid sludge , the uppermost layer is rigid rock , broken up into plates that float on the magma - bearing layers			2
what is driving this motion is not heat from the core , but cooling at @entity7 's surface			2
when material in the planet 's crust cools , it sinks , displacing material deeper in the mantle and forcing it upward			1
@entity54 , which is less dense than the surrounding mantle , rises until it reaches the bottom of the plates that run through them the textbook image ( left ) of magma being spewed out from narrow jets deep within @entity62 ( right ) is wrong , according to a new study			2
researchers now believe that those narrow jets do n't exist @entity54 from the mantle beneath the plates bursts through the plate to create volcanoes			0
' much of solid - @entity7 science for the past 20 years - and large amounts of money - have been spent looking for elusive narrow mantle plumes that wind their way upward through the mantle , ' said professor @entity26			1
top - down tectonics suggest that plate tectonics is driven by causes at the surface			0
instead of narrow jets , known as mantle plumes , there are broad upwellings of heat , which are balanced by narrow channels of sinking material called slabs			1
what is driving this motion is not heat from the core , but cooling at @entity7 's surface			2
when material in the planet 's crust cools , it sinks , displacing material deeper in the mantle and forcing it upward			1
@entity54 , which is less dense than the surrounding mantle , rises until it reaches the bottom of the plates or fissures that run through them			0
stresses in the plates , cracks , and other tectonic forces can squeeze the magma out , in a similar way to how water is squeezed out of a sponge			0
that magma then erupts out of the surface as volcanoes			0
now , thanks in part to more seismic stations spaced closer together , analysis of the planet 's seismology is good enough to confirm that there are no narrow mantle plumes			1
instead , data reveals that there are large , slow , upward - moving chunks of mantle 620 miles ( 1,000km ) wide			1
in the mantle - plume theory , professor @entity26 explains , the heat that is transferred upward via jets is balanced by the slower downward motion of cooled , broad , uniform chunks of mantle			1
the new measurements suggest that what is really happening is just the opposite : instead of narrow jets , there are broad ' upwellings ' , which are balanced by narrow channels of sinking material called slabs			0
what is driving this motion is not heat from the core , but cooling at @entity7 's surface			2
in fact , professor @entity26 says , the behaviour is the regular mantle convection first proposed more than a century ago by @entity146			0
when material in the planet 's crust cools , it sinks , displacing material deeper in the mantle and forcing it upward			1
' what 's new is incredibly simple : upwellings in the mantle are thousands of kilometres across , ' professor @entity26 said			0
when material in the planet 's crust cools , it sinks , displacing material deeper in the mantle and forcing it upward			1
@entity54 , which is less dense than the surrounding mantle , rises until it reaches the bottom of the plates or fissures that run through them , according to the theory he calls this theory ' top - down tectonics , ' based on @entity146 's initial principles of mantle convection			2

stresses in the plates , cracks , and other tectonic forces can squeeze the magma out , in a similar way to how water is squeezed out of a sponge			0
that magma then erupts out of the surface as volcanoes			0
the magma comes from within the upper 124 miles ( 200km ) of the mantle and not thousands of miles deep , as the mantle - plume theory suggests			2
' this is a simple demonstration that volcanoes are the result of normal broad - scale convection and plate tectonics , ' professor @entity26 says .			0

conventional theory is that mantle plumes bring magma to the surface
the thin jets are assumed to exist but scientists have never seen them
new seismic data reveals large upward - moving chunks instead of jets
what is driving motion is not mantle heat , but cooling at the surface
when material in the planet 's crust cools , it sinks , displacing material deeper in the mantle and forcing it upward , claims scientists at @entity27
