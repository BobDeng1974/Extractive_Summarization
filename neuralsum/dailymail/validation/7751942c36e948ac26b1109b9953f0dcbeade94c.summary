@entity0 may be pondering a recall for @entity2 but @entity4 openers @entity3 and @entity5 are ready and waiting to answer the call should selectors opt for new blood in the @entity9			1
@entity0 play three tests in the @entity11 next month , where they will hope to shake off the ignominy of their woeful @entity14 campaign			0
the identity of captain @entity17 's batting partner is likely to be one of the most vexed questions during selection meetings this week , with incumbent @entity21 on shaky ground and @entity2 reportedly being considered for the first time since departing the 2013/14 ashes with a stress - related condition			1
@entity2 is reportedly being considered for an @entity0 recall ahead of @entity9 tour @entity4 batsmen @entity3 ( left ) and @entity5 are ready and willing to provide top order cover he made his name as a @entity32 but with another @entity4 batsman , @entity33 , having made that slot his own , @entity2 is being considered for a promotion			1
even if the 33 - year - old travels , @entity0 may be tempted to take top - order cover and the title - winning pairing are first in line			1
@entity3 was the top scorer in @entity41 of the @entity42 last summer , making 1489 runs and scoring six centuries , while 21 - year - old @entity5 made 971 runs is rated as one of the country 's brightest prospects			1
' i feel like i 've had a good winter with @entity51 and hopefully i get the telephone call which i think i thoroughly deserve , ' @entity3 told @entity53			0
' i 'm looking forward to what might come for me			0
you can see how many people in recent years have gone on from playing @entity51 cricket to representing @entity0 and hopefully i can be the next one			0
@entity5 and @entity3 were instrumental in winning the @entity42 with @entity4 last year @entity2 has not been selected by @entity0 since departing the 2013/14 ashes with a stress related condition ' if that 's not the case all i can do is keep scoring runs for @entity4			1
' @entity3 and @entity5 are an unusual study in partners as rivals - as well as batting together throughout the county season they also played for the @entity51 in @entity68 over the winter			2
even now they are leading rival @entity4 teams in an inter-club friendly in @entity73 , but their relationship remains strong			0
' of course i get on really well with @entity5 and if he gets the nod i 'll give him a pat on the back and say well done , but i obviously hope it 's me , ' added @entity3			2
captain @entity79 faces the press after @entity0 's disastrous exit from the @entity14 @entity0 vice captain @entity82 looks dejected as he leaves the field following defeat by @entity85 @entity5 is aware of the interest he has attracted as a stylish young opener , but is attempting to remain on an even keel as speculation over a test call builds			1
' i know i 've had a good 18 months or so but i 've got to keep knocking on the door and getting those runs , ' he told @entity93			0
' personally the talk does n't affect me , positive or negative , because people are always going to have their opinion on you and you just have to focus on your game			0
' there is a spot with @entity0 and there 's a few players in the mix. i think there will be an opportunity for somebody this year			2
' it 's quite refreshing that both me and @entity109 are in the mix , we can really push each other on to be our best			0
' that 's good for us and hopefully it 's good for @entity4			2

@entity4 batsmen @entity3 and @entity5 may be selected for @entity0 's three @entity117 tour of @entity9
