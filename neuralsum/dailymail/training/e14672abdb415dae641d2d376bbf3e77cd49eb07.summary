even still , this occurs very rarely and only in the second floor bathroom			0
' ' slightly haunted ' : this possessed 1901 @entity32 house at 1217 @entity34 house in @entity35 , @entity13 ( center ) is on the market for $ 144,000 packed with poltergeists : @entity11 has put his @entity14 , @entity13 home on the market for just $ 144,000 - and he has assured potential buyers it 's not so creepy and it gets creepier			1
@entity11 described occasionally hearing voices in his daughter ’s room when she was an infant			0
' it sounded like there was a person in the room with her talking			0
we ’d go in , and she was just sitting there			0
but she normally cried constantly , ' he said			0
even though @entity56 law does n't require that @entity11 disclose a haunting , he decided it would be fair to be upfront			0
and his honesty seems to have paid off			0
@entity11 said he has been inundated with queries since listing the four bedroom property , which was built in 1901 , about six days ago			1
' when i was writing it , i had been thinking about it , and i went back and forth , ' he told @entity24			0
' the way i worded it — i was trying to keep it light			0
i have been reading online , and people saying you are supposed to disclose it			0
i do n’t know the laws here , but thought better safe than sorry			0
' i ’ve gotten a lot of offers			1
i guess any publicity is good publicity			0
i think it ’s helping in the long run			0
it ’s a nice house			1
if it ’s getting it out there and a buyer likes the house , they probably wo n’t be dissuaded			1

' @entity85 , but it ’s an old house			1
it ’s not that often			0
i used to have roommates , and my wife ’s friend swears the house is possessed			1
i have other friends that come over and say it ’s the most calming house they ’ve been in , ' he said			2
buyer beware : the seller says you may find ' the occasional ghastly visage lurking behind you in the bathroom mirror			2
even still , this occurs very rarely and only in the second floor bathroom ' ( pictured ) eerie : the sounds of phantom footsteps can be heard on the staircase and throughout the haunted house although the spine - tingling property is not for the fainthearted , lovers of the paranormal may consider the home a steal			1
according to the listing , the spacious home boasts stain - glass windows , a study / library with a secret door behind a moving bookcase which leads into a small office , a large crawl space behind a concealed door hidden in a bedroom closet and a basement with a wet bar			2
for some buyers , the supernatural activity may be an added extra			0
a recent survey by @entity128 found that more than half of home buyers are open to purchasing a haunted house			1
about 35 percent of the nearly 1,400 respondents said they have lived in a haunted home			2
' when purchasing a home , buyers want to know what they are getting into and that includes anything potentially spooky , ' @entity134 , vice president of corporate communications for @entity136 , which operates @entity128 , told @entity142			2
' our data reveals that while the majority of consumers are open to purchasing a haunted home , many buyers conduct research on a home ’s history to be aware of any weird incidences			2
' but , she added , while some people ' are willing to purchase a haunted home at a discounted price , many say levitating objects , ghost sightings and objects moving from one place to another would deter them from purchasing a home			2
