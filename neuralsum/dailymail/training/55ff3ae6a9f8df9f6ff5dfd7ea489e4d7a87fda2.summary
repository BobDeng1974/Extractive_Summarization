by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 heads into @entity4 's summer break with a smile on his face after believing he has proven himself in times of adversity			1
@entity2 could have been cut severely adrift of @entity12 team - mate and title rival @entity9 in the championship standings following disastrous qualifying sessions in the last two races			1
but from 20th on the grid in the @entity18 @entity17 following a brake disc failure , and a pit - lane start in @entity21 on sunday in the wake of a fire sparked by a fuel leak , @entity2 battled through to third on both occasions			1
time for a toast : @entity2 did well to find himself on the podium in the @entity21 @entity17 on sunday close : @entity2 fought off @entity12 and championship rival @entity9 to secure third place with eight races of the campaign remaining come @entity4 's resumption in @entity33 in three weeks ' time , @entity2 's deficit to @entity9 is only 11 points			1
@entity2 has used the phrase ' damage limitation ' all too often this season , but is able to head away on holiday relieved to still be in the hunt for motor sport 's prized crown			2
' we 've had some difficult weekends throughout this season , but if i 'm honest , looking back at it now , i would n't want it any other way , ' said @entity2 on the team 's official website			1
' sometimes it 's nice to have things easy , but i love a challenge and i love a fight			0
it 's not the times of ease that show who you are - it 's the times of adversity			0
' i definitely feel like the tough breaks i 've had this year have made me stronger , and hopefully i 've shown i 've got heart			0
' to have taken two podiums from two difficult weekends before the break has been really satisfying			0
' more than that , it allows me to smile and enjoy this time off knowing i still have an opportunity to fight for this championship			0
' @entity2 has revealed his holiday time will combine lazing on a beach with working out at the gym , the latter to put on extra muscle lost earlier this season to accommodate the new weight regulations			2
the recent removal from all cars of a particular suspension system will allow @entity2 ' to bulk up a bit '			2
beyond that , it will then be full - attack mode from @entity2 for the final eight races in which he will be hoping for more luck when it comes to reliability			1
fight until the end : @entity87 currently leads by 11 points with eight fascinating races remaining spinning off : @entity2 seems to be at ease with his car once again after some questionable recent laps ' i 'm happy with our performance so far this year in terms of the pace we have in the car , ' added @entity2			1
' the team have done a great job with that			0
we just need to work on the reliability , and i know that 's the priority for everyone back at the factories			0
' i have to say , though , over the last two weekends in @entity18 and @entity21 in particular , the guys have been amazing			2
' it 's tough for everyone involved when reliability comes into play			0
' to see these issues happen after all the long hours and hard work they 've put in , i know it hurts them as much as it hurts me			0
' to then fight through , get the car back together , get me out there and not give up or lose hope , i ca n't thank them enough for everything they do and that 's what 's going to keep me going right through this year			0
' there 's still a long , long way to go and i know both the guys and myself will keep pushing right to the chequered flag in @entity129			0
' we 'll be back stronger than ever in @entity131			0
' talking it over : @entity134 's @entity133 came out victorious in the final gp before the mid-season break meanwhile , @entity136 is convinced @entity137 can push @entity12 all the way when @entity4 returns from its summer break			1
@entity137 have been a revelation this year , scoring almost as many points in the first 11 races as they have managed in the previous four years following the introduction of the new scoring system			1
unfortunately for @entity136 , in his first year with the team after many seasons of service with @entity149 , the @entity150 has been plagued by bad luck and involved in a number of incidents			2
it means @entity136 has scored only 40 of @entity137 ' 135 points in total , compared to the 95 for team - mate @entity157			1
but the 33 - year - old has no doubt he and @entity137 can deliver over the final eight races , in particular in the opening two in @entity33 and @entity162 where the power circuits of @entity131 and @entity164 should play to the car 's strengths			1
keeping cool : @entity136 believes @entity137 can compete with @entity12 when @entity4 returns ' i 'm sure we can have a very good second half of the season looking at the behaviour of the car until now , ' said @entity136			1
' @entity131 and @entity164 should suit us , maybe @entity174 and @entity150 , and in the last race in @entity129 there are some good straights			0
' the car can be competitive at many tracks , not just @entity131 and @entity164 , but maybe at those two we can be stronger than the others			2
' it wo n't be easy , but it 's not impossible that at these tracks we will have more of a chance against @entity12			2

@entity2 just 11 points behind @entity12 team - mate @entity9
@entity187 driver finished third in @entity21 @entity17 last sunday
comfortable in car , *insists* he can push on to win championship
@entity136 believes @entity137 will be competitive again upon *restart*
