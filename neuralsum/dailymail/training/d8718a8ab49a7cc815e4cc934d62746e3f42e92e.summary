by @entity0 published : 04:09 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 09:50 est , 24 january 2013 relatives of a pastor 's son accused of killing his parents and three siblings in @entity6 claim the teenager is not a ' monster ' but a may have suffered a mental breakdown			2
@entity10 , 15 , allegedly used his father 's .22 rifle and @entity14 semiautomatic rifle to shoot his sleeping mother @entity15 before killing his nine - year - old brother @entity16 and two sisters , @entity18 , five , and @entity19 , two			1
it is claimed he then lay in wait at least four hours for his father , @entity21 , to return to the family home in a rural area southwest of downtown @entity24 and then shot him dead late on saturday night			1
police believe the video game - obsessed teen - who had allegedly spent a week plotting the murders - then spent the rest of the day at his local church			1
but his uncle has claimed the teenager was a doting older brother who could not be responsible for the horrific killing spree			1
however , we are deeply concerned about the portrayal in some media of @entity65 as some kind of a monster			0
' it is clear to those of us who know and love him that something went terribly wrong			0
whether it was a mental breakdown or some deeper undiagnosed psychological issue , we ca nâ€™t be sure yet			0
' what we do know is that none of us , even in our wildest nightmare , could have imagined that he could do something like this			0
' he is a troubled young man who made a terrible decision that will haunt him and his family forever			2
' five lives have been senselessly and needlessly ended			0
ruining one more without trying to get to the bottom of what really happened and more importantly - why - would be equally tragic			0
' it comes as police revealed that @entity10 spent the rest of day after the killings wandering the church grounds while sunday school teachers were being trained on how to deal with a shooter			1
the teen then allegedly told a pastor he had found his family dead in his home			1
former police officer and @entity24 security chief @entity95 , who was teaching the @entity98 security class , then took @entity10 to his house where he discovered the murdered family			1
crime scene : authorities investigate the death of pastor @entity104 and family members at his home on sunday morning filling in the gaps : sheriff @entity107 ( right ) and lt. @entity108 ( left ) said that the teen has been ' very unemotional ' throughout his questioning and is currently being held in the local juvenile detention center religious : the boy 's father , a former pastor , was thought to be working at a local mission at the time that his wife and three children were killed , and only returned home at around 5am when his son then allegedly shot him he said : ' when i met @entity10 , i knew something was n't right			1
i could feel it , i could see it in his eyes and i could see it in his behavior and his demeanor so the red flags went up and that 's when i called the sheriff 's department			0
' @entity95 , who had known the @entity10 family for about 10 years , said he drove the teen back to the family 's rural southwest @entity24 home to meet authorities , interviewing him along the way			1
' he went into detail of where they were , where the guns were and he was very matter - of - fact , really cold so i knew something was n't right , ' @entity95 said			0
after finding the bodies , sheriff 's officials say , they took the teen to headquarters			0
during questioning , they say he confessed to shooting his mother and three younger siblings in their beds shortly after 1 am			0
investigators said he admitted he was ' frustrated ' with his mother , but only seemed to show emotion when he spoke about video games he loved , such as @entity158 and @entity159 they say he then waited in a bathroom with a military - style semi-automatic rifle to ambush his father upon his return from an overnight shift at a homeless shelter			0
he allegedly also told them he had reloaded the family 's rifles and taken them with him in the family van with plans to randomly shoot more people			2
suspected shooter : @entity10 , 15 , was said to regularly wear military camouflage gear around the neighborhood ' quiet ' : @entity65 was not registered with the school district so he was thought to be home schooled ' that sends chills down my spine , ' @entity95 said			1
@entity95 said several people spotted @entity10 at the church but thought nothing of it until his arrest			2
he said officials then reviewed security video and found the teen had spent much of the day there			2
he said he does n't know why @entity10 decided to come to the church , but that it was like a second home for the boy , who was schooled at his house			1
' it was a familiar place to him , ' @entity95 said			0
' i think if he did have in his mindset to do something foolish and start shooting people there also , i think his demeanor was tamed a little bit because he saw people there he knew			0
' a prayer vigil was held at the church on wednesday night for victims @entity206 , 51 , his wife , @entity208 , 40 , and three of their children - a 9 - year - old boy , @entity212 , and daughters @entity214 , 5 , and @entity215 , 2			1
before the start of the vigil , members of the crowd shared hugs and handshakes as photographs of the victims were displayed on large digital screens at the front of the church			2
