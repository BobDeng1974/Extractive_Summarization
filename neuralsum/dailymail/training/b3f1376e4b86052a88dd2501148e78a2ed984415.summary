the @entity20 want the new center to provide tickets , restrooms and a shop selling sandwiches			1
ms @entity9 said : ' people come to experience the fantasy , the wonder and beauty of that world			0
' if the first thing they see upon entering the gates of this magical kingdom is a new building selling plastic shrink - wrapped sandwiches , it will forever change their enjoyment of the visit			2
' the neighborhood association filed the lawsuit friday in @entity40 against the @entity20 , which owns several mansions in this seaside tourist town , operating them as museums			1
the @entity4 a national historic landmark which includes 70 rooms , is its crown jewel and draws 400,000 visitors annually			1
national landmark : a proposal to build a visitors center on the grounds of @entity4 , the @entity9 family mansion and national historic landmark , is dividing @entity5 's preservationists , neighbors high profile descendants : @entity10 ( left and right ) with her son @entity58 and her @entity13 anchor son are living relatives of @entity61 - the famous railiway magnate proposed visitors center : the @entity20 says it took painstaking care to have its architects design a structure that would blend into the landscape and incorporate lovely style elements of the 19th century sore point : the @entity72 ¿ s ' cottage ' in @entity5 , @entity73 , draws 400,000 visitors a year			1
a proposal to build a visitors center on the grounds is raising hackles modernization : a rendering of the proposed visitors center at the @entity4			1
portable toilets are there now the group wants to build the center on the 13 - acre grounds of the mansion to provide visitors with services including ticketing , accessible restrooms and prepared sandwiches			1
the neighbors group argues in its lawsuit that the plan violates a number of provisions of the city zoning ordinance , including because it is in a residential neighborhood and a museum and because it would house what the group says is a restaurant			2
lawyer @entity103 argues the zoning rules do n't allow that			0
a spokeswoman for the preservation society disagreed in a written statement			0
' @entity110 believes the lawsuit is completely without merit and we will vigorously defend against it , ' society spokeswoman @entity109 said			0

' stunning : the @entity4 , named for the breaking @entity117 waves it overlooks , is one of the most popular historic house museums in the @entity120 historic : the estate opened in in 1895 , during a time when @entity5 functioned as the nation 's summer social capital , and became the crown jewel in a city populated by mansions plans : the @entity20 's plan calls for a 3,700 - square - foot building reminiscent of a conservatory to be built inside a grove of trees , where it says it would not be visible from the house or street			1
for : the @entity20 , the nonprofit group that owns the 70 - room mansion , says the center is badly needed to serve @entity4 ' 400,000 annual visitors the dispute over the welcome center has grown rancorous since the @entity20 publicly announced the project last year			1
the neighbors group and members of the @entity9 family , including designer @entity10 , have argued against building the center on the estate 's grounds , with several arguing a better location would be directly across the street in a parking lot			1
the society says it has explored the alternatives , but none of them are feasible			0
building it across the street would take up too many parking spaces and would be too far away from the house , the group has said			1
many of the state 's influential economic development and tourism officials have lined up in favor of the project			2
the @entity168 also weighed in , saying in a letter it was concerned the plan could damage the national historic landmark and asking the group to reconsider			2
but a few days later , it retracted the letter and apologized for sending it on the eve of a critical vote by the city 's zoning board in january			2
the board ultimately gave the project the go - ahead , overturning a decision by the @entity185 that found the project was incompatible with local historic standards			0
@entity188 , who lives near @entity4 and is a member of the neighbors group , said on monday that the neighbors also plan a separate lawsuit to appeal that zoning board decision			1
against : many opponents agree something is needed , but they want it across the street in the parking lot or elsewhere , not on the 13 - acre grounds of the property , which they say would be irreparably damaged history : the @entity5 homes were they were built during the so - called ' @entity19 ' in @entity120 history which was the period roughly from 1877 to the turn of the @entity207 grand : the @entity4 ( pictured ) was one of the finest of the holiday ' cottages ' built by wealthy families in @entity5 during the late 19th and early @entity207 the @entity4 , named for the breaking @entity117 waves it overlooks , is one of the most popular historic house museums in the @entity120			1
the estate opened in in 1895 , during a time when @entity5 functioned as the nation 's summer social capital , and became the crown jewel in a city populated by mansions			1
by the middle of the 20th century , though , many of the once - splendid homes had fallen into disrepair			0
the @entity20 was formed to save some of those buildings			1
plan : those who visit @entity4 today must either pay admission at a small ticket booth or at a tent erected on the grounds during warmer months			1
a new building will allow guests to pay and gather on site but away from the main house it purchased @entity4 from @entity9 's descendants in the 1970s and today owns 11 properties that collectively receive more than 900,000 visitors annually			1
wealthy families from @entity243 and @entity244 built huge houses with sprawling gardens in @entity5 in which to holiday in the summer and to entertain guests			0
they were built during the so - called ' @entity19 ' in @entity120 history which was the period roughly from 1877 to the turn of the @entity207			0

@entity257 : the @entity258 was built between 1888 and 1892 for @entity259 and @entity260			0
its construction is credited with helping to transform @entity5 into a holiday destination for @entity120 's wealthiest families picturesque : @entity265 was built as a @entity267 - style villa for @entity268 , a merchant in the @entity271 trade			2
it is now open to the public as a museum the buildings became key symbols of status within @entity243 high society , with families trying to outdo each other with the expense and beauty of their homes			0
the mansions , which were known , ironically perhaps , as ' cottages , ' costs tens of thousands of dollars to build ( millions of dollars in today 's money ) and boasted features such as marble floors and fire places , palladian columns , electricity and other luxuries of the time			0
perhaps the finest of these houses was @entity4 which was built in 1895			2
the grandiose @entity258 , which was built between 1888 and 1892 by the @entity9 , is credited with helping to attract other wealthy families to follow suit by building holiday homes in @entity5			0
design : built between 1881 and 1883 , the @entity299 , @entity5 , is considered to be one of the finest @entity302 houses in the @entity120 finery : built between 1898 and 1902 , @entity304 was built by @entity304 - a ' silver heiress ' from @entity306 families came to @entity5 for the social season holding grand parties			0
however , for all their grandeur , the houses often had relatively few bedrooms , as the guests were expected to have their own property nearby			0
many of the mansions were designed by the renowned @entity243 - based architect @entity317 , who had a house in @entity5 himself			0
many of the mansions remain in private use , although a number are now card for by the @entity20			2
others were converted into academic buildings for @entity325 in the 1930s			0
decorative : @entity328 is one of the first summer ' cottages ' to be built in @entity5			0
the house is owned by the @entity20 and is open to the public			2

the @entity20 , the nonprofit group that owns the 70 - room mansion , says the center is badly needed to serve @entity4 ' 400,000 annual visitors
while opponents agree something is needed , they want it across the street in the parking lot or elsewhere so it will not disrupt the look of the estate
@entity10 , the designer , mother of @entity13 's @entity12 and scion of the famous family , has also spoken out against plans for the center
