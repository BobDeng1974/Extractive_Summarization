the @entity10 champion has registered his name as a trademark with the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , which will cover branded knickers , suspenders , boxer shorts , socks and dresses			1
however , @entity2 fans hoping the tennis ace is about to launch his own underwear brand , as @entity5 did last year with @entity21 , are set for disappointment as the sportsman is thought to have made the move to stop others cashing in on his fame with unlicensed merchandise			1
net profit : wimbledon champion @entity2 has trademarked his name , including on items such as lingerie , suspenders and boxer shorts @entity2 's trademark covers more than 100 items , including computer games , sportswear , dvds and stationary , as well as more unusual items such as @entity40 costumes , greetings cards , toy dolls , slippers , bath toys , roller skates , colouring books , paddling pools and surf boards			1
although @entity2 's team say he is unlikely to bring out his own lingerie line , the trademark will prevent others from doing so			2
' it 's unlikely he 'll make millions selling sexy bras with ' @entity2 ' written on them but who knows ? with this trademark being approved it means that he could if he ever wanted to , ' a source told @entity59 in action : @entity2 takes to the court during the @entity62 this week			2

there had already been attempts made to trademark ' @entity2 ' , ' @entity113 ' , and ' @entity114 '			2
it was rubber stamped on @entity117 after no objections to the trademark were received			0
the reigning @entity121 's move is understood to be part of a plan by his management team to turn him into a global brand , with other stars who have successful trademarked their names , including @entity5 and @entity130			0
@entity2 's tennis rival @entity131 successfully trademarked the logo of his @entity134 brand			0
and @entity136 footballer @entity135 has trademarked his heart - shaped goal celebration as a logo			0
@entity139 , the head of trademarks legal team at @entity141 , who handled @entity2 's application , said the trademark would stop goods being produced under @entity2 's brand without permission			1
the trademark will also protect firms who have signed a deal with the sportsman to sell items bearing his name - including @entity75 , @entity155 rackets , and water company @entity156			0
' it gives the person the legal monopoly over their own name to stop counterfeit use , and to be able to licence the name to third parties , ' he said			0
