bad break - up : @entity6 ( left ) took ex-girlfriend @entity7 ( right ) to court accusing her of not giving back his record collection when they split as part of a messy break - up , miss @entity7 last year made a legally - binding promise at @entity24 not to damage or dispose of any of his things left behind in the flat they once shared			1
but mr @entity6 claims that despite attempts by his mother and himself to collect the valuable record collection , some 7,000 are still missing			1
among the vinyl lovingly gathered over 18 years and which he says are worth £ 17,500 , are a valuable early pressing of @entity9 ’ @entity31 and a copy of @entity34 ’s eponymous debut lp , he says			1
in march , the music graduate tried to have miss @entity7 jailed for allegedly breaking her promise - but a @entity16 county court judge believed her when she said she had no more of his property			2
as well as being a couple , mr @entity6 and artist @entity11 ran an art and rare record shop , called @entity15 , in @entity16 , before the split mr @entity6 , whose record collection still numbers 6,000 , took his case to the @entity47 , where he said what he really now wanted was his records back , or cash to compensate him for losing them			1

included in it are the entire back catalogues of the @entity73 , @entity74 and five			0
some are also signed by the artists			0
holding out some hope for mr @entity6 , mr @entity52 said his case was not one for an appeal , but that his fresh evidence could justify a new case going to the county court			2
' mr @entity6 is a serious collector of records and his whole collection he has itemised , from @entity86 , in a lengthy schedule which runs to 70 pages , ' said the judge			1
' it is a most impressive document and he says that , because he bought every one himself , he has been able to complete that from his own memory			0
' not only is he seeking the return of the items , but he is seeking instead , where appropriate , compensation in lieu of the return of the items			0
