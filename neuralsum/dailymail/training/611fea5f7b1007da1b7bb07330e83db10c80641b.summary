the second man to walk on the moon said @entity7 should abandon a plan to bring an asteroid into lunar orbit and concentrate on the @entity3 , calling progress since his 1969 mission ' slow '			1
speaking at a space conference in @entity14 , @entity1 said : ' if we were moving outward from there and an asteroid is a good stopping point , then fine			0
' but now it 's turned into a whole planetary defense exercise at the cost of our outward exploration			0
' the current plan would see a @entity7 robotic mission ' capture ' an asteroid and bring it back to the moon 's orbit in the early 2020s			1
then a team of astronauts would fly to the asteroid to take samples and run tests			0
@entity7 's @entity33 is currently exploring @entity3 , sending back pictures from the surface and collecting samples			1
@entity1 , who was the lunar module pilot on @entity38 , called for @entity7 to ' commit to permanence on @entity3 ' , reports @entity40			2
' we 'd become a two - planet species , ' he said			0
' in @entity3 , we 've been given a wonderful set of moons [ ... ] where we can send continuous numbers of people			2

@entity1 , photographed by fellow astronaut @entity56 , explored the @entity58 region of the @entity59 on july 20 , 1969 the one - way trips should begin with three people landing on the planet 's @entity62 , spending 18 months overseeing the robotic deployment of a base , he suggested			0
@entity1 , promoting his book @entity67 : my @entity68 , says @entity7 should have spacecraft on a cycle to and from the planet , sending more and more humans to expand the colony			0
@entity7 administrator @entity75 told the conference at @entity77 that the asteroid plan was a step towards a @entity3 mission			1
he said that @entity3 was ' the ultimate destination in our solar system and a priority for @entity7 ' while the asteroid exploration was ' critical for future @entity3 journeys '			2
@entity7 's @entity33 is currently exploring @entity3 , sending back photographs of the surface , but @entity1 says the agency should concentrate on establishing a colony @entity1 and @entity56 became the first humans to walk on the moon on july 20 , 1969			1
' it 's been 44 years since we stepped on the lunar surface , and i think the progress since then is a little slow , ' he said			0
' i want the next generation to feel as we did back when i was privileged enough to be a part of @entity100			0

the second man to walk on the moon wants the @entity2 to drop an asteroid plan
