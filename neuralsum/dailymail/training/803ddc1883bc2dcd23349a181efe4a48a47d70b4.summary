researchers claim those of @entity3 descent still living on the continent are related to each other through a common ancestry dating back just 1,000 years after centuries of almost endless conflict , it would be hard to claim @entity3 is one big family – but that 's just what we are , say scientists			1
those of @entity3 descent still living on the continent are related to each other through a common ancestry dating back just 1,000 years , they claim			1
even people geographically separated by thousands of miles , such as a @entity21 and a @entity22 , are distantly related			2
@entity24 researcher @entity23 said : ' what is remarkable is how closely everyone is related to each other			0
' on a genealogical level , everyone in @entity3 traces back to nearly the same set of ancestors only a thousand years ago			1
' professor @entity23 made the claim after checking the dna of more than 2,000 @entity3 for common segments that have been passed down the generations			1
as these chunks of dna get shorter from generation to generation , it is possible to work out how far back they date – and so when we shared ancestors			1
it might seem incredible that everyone who was alive in @entity3 in 1013 and had children is an ancestor of everyone on the continent today , the researchers say that simple maths backs them up			2
this is because the number of ancestors a person has doubles with each generation – you have two parents , four grandparents , eight great - grandparents and so on			0
the number grows so quickly that just 1,000 years back , or 30 generations , you have roughly one billion ancestors			1
this is far more than the population of the world , far less @entity3 , back then			1
as a result anyone from 1,000 years ago who left any descendants is related to every @entity3 alive today			1
the dna analysis showed that the number of ancestors shared by two people falls the further apart the pair live			1
so someone from the @entity71 is on average more related to another @entity21 than a @entity72			2
however , they have more dna in common with the @entity72 than with a @entity74			0
however , there are some blips			0
for instance , people in @entity71 have more distant cousins in @entity80 than they do here			1
a modern - day person living in the @entity71 shares ancestors with people across @entity3 , according to a study from the @entity85			1
this map shows the spread of ancestors up to 540 years ago			2
the larger the circle , the more ancestors of a certain person live in that location			0
you can see that even 540 years ago , the ' green ' person had a small cluster of ancestors in other parts of @entity3 professor @entity23 made the claim after checking the dna of more than 2,000 @entity3 for common segments that have been passed down the generations this , the journal @entity103 reports , is likely to be a result of migration from the smaller population of @entity80 to the larger one of the @entity71			1
@entity108 , professor of statistical genetics at @entity110 , said that it only takes a small amount of movement for new genes to gain a foothold in a population			0
he said : ' you do n't need a lot of migration , you just need some and that is pretty much what we see all through history , mainly through wars but also through trade and people looking for new pastures			0
' geneticists have previously estimated that only have to go back 3,500 years ago for everyone in the world to be related			2
these maps show where the distant cousins of modern - day people in the @entity71 live			2
bigger circles mean more ancestors , and numbers give average number of shared genetic ancestors			0
the further back in time , the more widespread the shared ancestors			2
in other words , many of us can trace our roots back to the same colourful characters			0
the charity sense about @entity146 has warned this devalues expensive mail order tests that claim to trace a person 's ancestry from a sample of their dna			0
it also means that claims that someone is related to a famous figure such as @entity158 or has @entity159 blood – are often as likely to be true for the person having the test as their boss or next - door neighbour			0
the researchers also revealed population spreads from other countries			0
the home country is starred , with populations over time shown in other colours			0

study looked at dna samples from 2,000 people across @entity3
people in the @entity71 have @entity180 ancestors that only date back 1,000 years
