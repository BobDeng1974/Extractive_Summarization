' wrong in whose definition of it ? ' @entity10 responded			2
@entity21 continued and slammed @entity10 's sexual encounter with @entity11 was ' not right ' but the pair were curious to find out what other species he was attracted to			1
' i have had some experiences with the family dog when i was an adolescent , ' @entity10 said			1
curious @entity21 asked : ' what did you do ? ' @entity10 responded : ' i tried to have intercourse with it and it was n't successful so i dropped that			1
' but before @entity20 and @entity21 could continue to bombard their questions , the interview was abruptly ' dumped ' by the radio 's censor			1
' this station you 've been listening to has been dumped			0
this means someone said something inappropriate and is currently getting in trouble , ' the radio said			0
' i started rubbing her ' : in new film , @entity31 , which premiered this week , @entity10 discusses his taboo relationship sneaking off : @entity10 has previously described how he was trusted to be alone with the dolphins , and waited until after nightfall to have sex with @entity11 it follows after a new film based on @entity10 's love affair , @entity75 which was premiered in january at the @entity76 in @entity77 , @entity78			1
@entity76 , which takes place at the same time as the more famous @entity80 , is seen as its edgier alternative and hosts more niche films			0
in the fifteen - minute video , @entity10 tells the cameras : ' i started rubbing her along her back , working my way to her flukes â€“ her tail			1
' and as i was rubbing her and moving my hand towards her tail , @entity11 was slowly rolling around her long axis			2
' according to @entity93 , @entity10 went on to describe the sex in even more detail , while an ' animated interpretation ' of the encounter was played			1
in previous interviews about this encounter , which he also turned into a novel called @entity100 , @entity10 has claimed the relationship was consensual			1
the relationship reportedly lasted a year			0
last year he told @entity104 's @entity103 : ' there 's something quite transcendental about making love with a dolphin			0
' the dolphin is very aware , the dolphin is an intelligent and creative creature and making love is a consummate act			0
' he added that their courtship began when @entity11 ' announced her intentions to me by positioning herself so i was rubbing against her			2
' he then detailed how he was often left alone with @entity11 and the other dolphins , whom he was photographing at the time			2
this allowed him to sneak off with her after closing time to have sex			0
in another interview , @entity10 said : ' it 's like being with a tiger or a bear			1
this is an animal that could kill you in two seconds if it wanted to			0
' performer : @entity11 , pictured above during a show , lived at the @entity136 theme park in @entity16 defunct : the park no longer exists , but used to offer sealife shows , as well as steamboat trips such as the one shown above according to @entity10 's blog , the screening of the film was ' well - received ' by its initial audience , and nobody walked out			1
in a personal verdict on the film , he describes the sex animation as ' beautiful '			1
he also says it is ' oddly accurate , without being graphic or vulgar			0
' he also reveals that some animators turned down the project once they discovered the controversial content of the film			0
@entity10 's acts would be illegal today			2
but @entity34 only enacted a law banning bestiality in 2011 , so the encounter he described in 1971 would not be covered			2
filmmakers @entity157 and @entity159 have defended their film 's content , say that @entity10 's experience is ' unique ' and an ' appealing ' subject for a documentary			1
they told the @entity165 : ' however uncomfortable it can be as a subject matter , what @entity10 experienced is unique and very real and very serious to him			2
' he is a member of a community ( zoophiles ) who live on the outermost fringes of society			0
' their reality is something most of us can not comprehend , relate to or know much about - all of that makes it all the more appealing to me as a subject to tackle			0
' while @entity10 's experience is undoubtedly out of the ordinary , there are other recorded incidents of dolphins having sex with humans - or at least trying to			1
one well - documented case involves a female scientist who started having sex with a dolphin in the 1960s as part of a @entity193 experiment to try to teach the creatures to speak @entity195			2
@entity196 was stationed in a flooded house in the @entity199 @entity198 in 1963 , where she was tasked with trying to teach an adolescent dolphin called @entity202			0
' precious and gentle ' : @entity196 , who had sex with a dolphin called @entity202 , above , in 1963 , has also opened up about her relationship at first she let @entity202 relieve his urges with female dolphins kept nearby - but later claimed it helped the experiment to let him have sex with her , instead			1
in a @entity213 film about the relationship , she said : ' @entity202 liked to be ... with me			2
he would rub himself on my knee , my foot or my hand and i allowed that			0
' i was n't uncomfortable - as long as it was n't too rough ... it was just easier to incorporate that and let it happen , it was very precious and very gentle , @entity202 was right there , he knew that i was right there			0
' ' it was sexual on his part - it was not sexual on mine , sensuous perhaps ... i was there to get to know @entity202 , that was part of @entity202			2
' dolphins also often target their advances on humans who have no interest in reciprocating			0
several tourists at dolphin swimming events have been leaped on and mounted by aroused dolphins , often to the amusement of onlookers , whose videos of the events have gained significant attention			0
however , the dangers of an advance can in some situations be very real , given the strength and size of dolphins , who often weigh more than 400lbs			0
in 2002 , swimmers on the @entity254 were warned of a dolphin which tried to attack a series of female swimmers in the sea by encircling them and isolating them from their companions .			0
