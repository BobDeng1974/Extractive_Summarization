you can then save your selfie , share it on social media , and purchase the products directly through the app. facial recognition : the virtual make up stays in place as you move your head and change your expression in real time and works in different lighting conditions - pictured are individual lip gloss and bronzer products makeover : while @entity68 editor @entity67 liked testing the individual products , she found the pre-set ' looks ' ( above ) a bit over the top ... and one setting added unsightly red blotches to her chest ( left ) according to @entity10 , the app works on all ethnicities and in over 400 different lighting conditions to ensure how the make up appears in the app is accurate to the product			1
@entity81 road - tested the app on a handful of staff , with mixed results			2
i tested out two looks - ' @entity88 ' and ' @entity89 ' , as well as the more natural - looking individual products like bronzer and eyeliner			2
the app was impressively accurate at placing the make up on my face , though it took a bit of adjusting to get some of the eyeliner looks perfect			2
while some of the ' looks ' bordered on scary drag , testing out individual products was proved more successful			2
the bronzer and lip gloss looks appeared perfectly and gave me a solid idea of how they would look on my skin			0
subtle : news reporter @entity107 tried subtle eye shadow and lip gloss looks , and thinks the app managed to apply make up better than she could do herself news reporter @entity111 tested ' @entity113 ' look , as well as the ' @entity115 ' look			2
she also tested some subtle bronzer and winged eyeliner			0
' i thought it was a really smart way of trying out new looks without having to stand in a make - up aisle and test things in front of tiny smudged mirrors , ' she said			0
' it ’s also much more hygienic than using testers in the shops			0
' the make - up looked like it had been applied professionally – probably better than i could actually do myself ! ' editorial assistant @entity128 liked the naturally sunkissed look the @entity130 gave her			0
impressed : editorial assistant @entity128 liked the subtlety of the lip gloss ( left ) , and bronzer ( right ) and says it gave her a good idea of the looks she could achieve with the products ' i thought it was a really great way of trying out the range of products available , ' she said			2
' although you do n’t get the chance to feel how the products work on your skin and how they apply as you would in a shop , you certainly get a good idea of the looks you can achieve with them			0
' showbiz reporter @entity148 was less impressed , struggling to get the eyeliner and eyeshadow looks to place accurately			0
‘ while it was definitely a bit of fun trying out the different looks , the app seemed to put the make - up over my left eye a lot for some reason , despite trying to “ calibrate ” a number of times , ' @entity148 said			1
the major drawback of the app is that it sucked the life out of my phone - my battery , which had been at 100 per cent , was almost gone after 20 minutes playing with my make up			0
dramatic eyes : showbiz reporter @entity148 enjoyed the effect of the bold winged eye liner , but found it took several attempts to get the placement of the make up right the app has been downloaded 10 million times in the @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 , and @entity179 is predicting 500,000 downloads in @entity18 this year			1
