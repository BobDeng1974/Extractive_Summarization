by @entity0 a former offshore processing official says refugee advocates are encouraging asylum seekers in @entity5 's immigration detention centres to self harm so the advocates can use the incidents for their own political agenda			1
@entity10 told @entity11 a handful of ' extreme ' refugee campaigners coached ' ringleaders ' in detention centres who stood over more vulnerable asylum seekers , forcing them to sew their lips together , make suicide attempts and harm themselves to gain publicity for the advocates ' cause			1
' then these advocates are ready with a media release to promote their cause , ' he said , ' they often know about the incident before the minister or the department does and that 's because they organised it			2
' he said the practice was confined to a minority of advocates , but that it was ' despicable '			0
former immigration official @entity10 says actions by extreme refugee advocates to pus their political barrow caused the fatal riot staged riot : a violent clash between asylum seekers house on @entity54 detection centre ( pictured ) , north of @entity66 , was the result of extremist refugee advocates encouraging violence to further their political cause back in @entity5 ' i 'm not saying this is the majority of advocates - most refugee advocates are genuinely interested in giving a voice to the voiceless and making people aware of the circumstances around asylum seekers			1
' however there are some who do and i am sure that this is what happened before the violent protest on @entity54 which resulted in the death of @entity56			2
' ' in reality there is a lot of self harm by detainees in immigration detention centres which is due to mental health issues which they experience while in detention			2
' but some high profile advocates are using people to prey on the more vulnerable among them to lip sewing and other harming activities			2
' mr @entity56 was killed on february 17 during a riot inside the @entity54 detention centre in @entity66			1
political agenda : @entity10 ( pictured ) says that while most refugee advocates genuinely care about giving refugees a voice , but that an unscrupulous few entice ringleaders to stand over more vulnerable asylum seekers , forcing them to sew their lips together , make suicide attempts and harm themselves to gain publicity for the advocates ' cause the 23 - year - old @entity57 allegedly died after he was beaten with a wooden stick and kicked , before being hit on the head with a rock , during a confrontation between detainees and @entity66 locals in which 62 people were injured			1
mr @entity10 is a former @entity122 regional manager who once worked in @entity37 detention centre			1
he resigned in december 2012 and has since been critical of both sides in the immigration and asylum seeker debate			0

he was responding to questions about a claim by the @entity133 that ten women in detention on @entity47 had attempted suicide this week so that their orphaned babies might be brought up in @entity5			1
the @entity5 reported the @entity133 spokesman @entity138 had ' backed down ' from his earlier claimed that ' 10 mothers in the family camp have attempted suicide in the last two days on @entity47 '			1
the newspaper quoted mr @entity138 as saying he ' probably should n't have said attempted suicide ' because ' people drinking concoctions of shampoo or detergent generally do n’t die — was it a drastic cry for help ? yes , it was , and it remains that way '			1
mr @entity138 told @entity11 that his apparent ' backdown ' was nothing of the sort and had arisen out of a discussion about how the incident should have been reported			0
' i am not resiling from what took place and that is self harm , ' he told @entity11			0
' there are degrees of self harm			0
some people slash their stomachs , some people drink concoctions			0
' they drank shampoo , cut themselves , attempted to cut themselves			0
drinking shampoo can kill you			0
' probably if i 'd said ten women were self harming , there is n't any distinction between self harming and suicide			2
' @entity47 : claims of women attempting suicide in @entity47 detention centre this week so that their orphaned children could become residents of @entity5 appear to have been exaggerated			1
the island which lies in the @entity186 2600km northwest of @entity187 attracts boats like the vessel pictured off the island 's @entity190 in august , 2011 , from nearby neighbouring countries such as @entity193 the detention centre on @entity47 ( above ) opened in 2001 and now houses more than 1200 asylum seekers who arrived on boats from @entity193 and other neighbouring countries island detention : asylum seekers at @entity54 detention centre ( pictured ) attempt self harm because of mental health issues , but some are induced by the political agendas of extremist refugee advocates mr @entity138 denied encouraging individuals to self harm for his own political agenda			1
' it 's the system which encourages self harm , ' he said , ' it breeds anxiety			0
' i do n't know individuals who actually self harmed			0
i do know some of the families			0
i got calls after the event			0
' mr @entity138 said it was impossible for him or other advocates to call into detention centres , but that detainees could call them			2
he said mr @entity10 's claims about advocates coaching detainees to self harm was ' sheer fantasy '			1
immigration minister @entity227 has denied the claims that mothers had attempted suicide on @entity47 so their children could gain @entity5 residency			1
up to 14 female asylum seekers on self - harm watch were being monitored by female staff , @entity47 shire councillor @entity236 told @entity238 immigration minister @entity227 is advised female staff are on hand to help women placed on watch when they are undertaking ' personal care tasks '			2
