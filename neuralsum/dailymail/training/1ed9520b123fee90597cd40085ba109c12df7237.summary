by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor former @entity3 minister @entity2 uses a new book to attack his own party for being too timid and not being bolder on tax and spending voters do not know what the @entity3 stand for because @entity10 is too focused on trying to please his critics , a former minister has claimed			1
@entity3 mp @entity2 warned people with liberal views do not see his party as their ' natural home ' as he urged mr @entity10 to be more radical in the last year of the coalition			1
the @entity19 mp called for the top rate of tax to be cut to 40p , said state schools should be able to make a profit and says the @entity24 should not be protected from spending cuts			1
in a new book , he claims the coalition has been paralysed by ' political procrastination '			2
he also takes a swipe at both coalition parties for indulging in a ' @entity32 auction ' of expensive , vote - winning policies at a time when the public is also being told to face many more years of austerity			2
mr @entity2 , who was sacked last autumn , has written @entity37 to counter the idea that the @entity3 stand for nothing more than being equidistant between the @entity40 and @entity41			2
the former @entity43 and @entity44 minister warns that @entity45 is failing to prepare for the ' @entity46 ' when @entity47 , @entity48 and other emerging economies in the @entity50 will dominate			2
in a preface to his book he said : ' we can not afford the political procrastination that is too often our default mode when faced with big decisions			0
' instead of a new hub airport , we have a new hub airport commission			1
instead of returning the top rate of tax from 50p to 40p , we uneasily split the difference at 45p			1
' instead of addressing the real causes of low wages - low productivity and educational failure - we pretend that artificial distortions of the labour market will painlessly make everyone wealthier			0
' and in an interview to promote the publication he went further , and suggested the @entity3 risk appealing to fewer voters by trying to please everyone			0
' i regret if people do n’t think the @entity3 are liberal and i think that is a real challenge for my party , of why a lot of people who have liberal views do n’t see the @entity3 as their natural home , ' he told @entity85 's today programme			2
he also suggested that mr @entity10 has failed to convince voters that he is a liberal , because he has sought to placate critics on the left of his party			1
' i do think @entity10 is a natural liberal ; i think he has sometimes felt forced to meet his detractors halfway and that has blurred his liberalism , but i think he is at heart a natural liberal and i think people who exhibit natural liberal tendencies tend to have the right answers to our national predicament			1
' his comments will be seen as a direct challenge to the authority of mr @entity10 , who is thought to have personally vetoed a further reduction in the top rate of tax			1
mr @entity2 's comments will be seen as a direct challenge to @entity10 , who he warns has ' felt forced to meet his detractors halfway ' obscuring his liberalism @entity3 treasury chief secretary @entity109 , the party 's leading voice on economic policy , has ruled out a further cut in the top rate of tax			1
speaking in february he said : ‘ i think it is right at 45 per cent			0
i would n't go to cutting below 45 per cent			0
i would say that would happen over my dead body			0
’ in the last weeks of the @entity41 government then - chancellor @entity117 increased it from 40p to 50p			0
@entity121 chancellor @entity120 then cut it to 45p in 2012 , claiming the measure had raised ‘ next to nothing ’ for the @entity124			0
@entity126 has vowed to return it to 50p if @entity41 wins the next election , but @entity40 are pushing for it to be reduced further to 40p			0
@entity3 treasury minister @entity109 has insisted the top rate of tax will be cut ' over my dead body ' but mr @entity2 says opposing a further cut was a major mistake which has left @entity45 with a top tax rate that is ' still too high '			1
' authentic liberals should feel uneasy about confiscatory levels of taxation , ' he writes			0
' if a 40p top rate of tax was high enough for @entity139 and @entity140 ( until his last few weeks in office ) then it should surely have been high enough for @entity143 and @entity10			1
' at a time of real economic difficulty , the government 's priority has been to cut income tax for people with low and middle rates of pay			0
' it has made commendable progress , but the timing of the cut in the top rate was regrettable , and suggests the government has a tine ear for the politics of austerity and shared sacrifice			2
' he says that the decision to cut the top rate of tax should have been delayed until this year , when it could have been tied to the increase in the personal allowance for ordinary workers			1
he also warns that it is ' unnerving ' to see both sides of the @entity171 unveiling costly spending pledges in the run - up to the next election despite the continuing need for austerity			0
he says mr @entity10 's plan for free school dinners for all infant children and @entity143 's introduction of a marriage tax break send out a ' confusing ' message that the need for spending cuts is over			1
' what would be a terrible let down now would be for the government to wobble , ' he says			0
' it is confusing for the public to see child benefit and the education maintenance allowance being cut on the grounds of affordability , only for the government to then announce a couple of lavish spending commitments			0
' mr @entity2 is on the @entity195 of the @entity3 , but denies he would consider defecting to the conservatives .			2

@entity2 urges his party to be more radical in last year of coalition
warns @entity10 has lost his liberalism by trying to placate critics
backs a hub airport , 40p top tax rate and @entity24 being *unprotected* from cuts
