by @entity0 footballer @entity1 was right - scientists have established that seagulls really do follow a trawler , for up to seven miles to be precise			1
the @entity6 star left most people baffled with his philosophical musings			0
but it was his most famous utterance , delivered to a press conference in 1995 , that any football fan can recite at heart : ‘ when seagulls follow the trawler , it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea			1
’ @entity1 , pictured , told bemused journalists at a press conference : ' when seagulls follow the trawler , it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea '			1
he was addressing the media after he had kung - fu kicked a @entity28 fan in 1995 the @entity29 was speaking about press interest following his kung fu kick on a @entity28 fan			1
but now scientists have established that his words were literally true			1
a study has found that sea birds really can sense a fishing boat from miles away and alter their flight patterns to zoom in			2
the research , by scientists at the @entity42 and @entity43 in @entity44 , found that a boat creates a ‘ halo of influence ’ for seven miles in every direction			1
gannets , @entity51 ’s largest seabird , can even differentiate a fishing boat from any other vessel			2
they are less likely to be attracted to boats that simply drift along than to boats whose crews are actively fishing			0
dr @entity59 of @entity43 said seabirds can recognise different types of boats and whether they are actually fishing @entity64 ’s dr @entity63 , who led the study tracking six colonies of northern gannets , said : ‘ while we knew that seabirds , including gannets , regularly followed fishing vessels , we were surprised at the distance at which the birds ’ behaviour was affected , expecting it to be a more localized phenomenon			2
’ the researchers tracked the movements of 74 individual birds around the @entity79 using high - resolution gps trackers			0
they compared their flight patterns to the gps logs of fishing boats , establishing that each boat had a remarkably wide impact on the birds			0
the study , published in the journal @entity89 , said the findings demonstrate that fishing vessels which throw discards into the water have a far bigger ecological footprint than previously thought			0
dr @entity59 of @entity43 said : ‘ the fact that birds responded differently to boats depending on whether they were fishing or not , and the type of gear they were carrying , indicates just how finely attuned these animals are to the opportunities humans can provide			0

@entity1 spoke about seabird feeding habits at a 1995 press conference
however , almost *20* *years* later scientists have proved him entirely correct
seabirds will follow trawlers for up to seven miles in the hope of a fish *supper*
