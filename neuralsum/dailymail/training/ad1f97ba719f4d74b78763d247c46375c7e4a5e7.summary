application : mr @entity1 hoped to get a job at the @entity3 call centre based in this building in @entity27 ' there was an enormous difference in the way i was treated when i used a @entity10 name , ' mr @entity1 said			1
' when i was first sent a rejection , i could n't understand it - i thought i had provided a very good cv			0
' i 'd offered advice to clients over the telephone before , so i believed i was a very good candidate for the job			2
