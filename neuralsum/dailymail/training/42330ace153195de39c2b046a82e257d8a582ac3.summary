as speeding tickets go it was just one of thousands handed out in the 1930 's as the car took over a once provincial @entity4 and the autobahns opened the country up to the common man			2
but the man who received it was no ordinary motorist			0
he was @entity10 , in the driving seat of the @entity12 , and definitely not amused the day he was booked for going too fast in his supercharged @entity14 limousine			1
but was he driving ? documents revealed @entity10 had asked chauffeur @entity16 ( pictured behind the wheel ) to drive fast after he was given a speeding ticket near @entity19 in 1931 @entity10 's long lost speeding summons has been found in a @entity22 archive			1
he was handed the fine in the tiny hamlet of @entity25 , south of the city of @entity27 , on september 19 , 1931 - a little over two and - a - half years before he became chancellor and @entity29			1
a senior police officer called @entity31 from the @entity22 gendarme station @entity32 put in his notebook how a car travelling at 1.37pm on the road towards @entity36 was travelling at a ' high speed '			1
taking the blame : @entity16 , right , stood to be banned after he was clocked driving more than twice the speed limit in @entity10 's personal @entity14 he also put down the number plate - @entity40 â€“ 19357 - which happened to be @entity10 's personal car and sent to details to superiors in @entity36 to learn who the car 's owner was			1
the incident happened long before the days of speed cameras			0
in his report @entity31 wrote : ' the speed of the vehicle was determined by two officials with two stop watches			0
' the car drove over a measured distance of 200m in 13 seconds , which results in the average speed of 55.3 km per hour ( 34.3mph )			0
' in a hurry : @entity10 , pictured in @entity60 in 1934 , may have been rushing back to @entity36 after his half - niece @entity61 shot herself in the flat they shared this was double the permitted speed limit on the road at that time and should have resulted in an immediate ban			1
three days later @entity31 received the information that the car belonged to one @entity71 @entity10 , who lived at @entity72 and he issued the speeding ticket			2
@entity10 's former flat still exists only now it is , ironically , a police station			0
but it is doubtful if @entity10 or his party ever had to pay a fine			0
certainly no document surfaced alongside the original report stating that he had to cough up			0
there was , however , another document found in the archive with the word ' settled ' stamped on it relating to the incident			0
staff : @entity10 poses for a signed photograph with members of the @entity91 in 1929			0
( from left ) adjutant @entity93 , @entity16 , @entity10 , future @entity95 colonel @entity94 and psychiatrist @entity96 @entity10 said he was not at the wheel at the time but that it was being driven by his chauffeur @entity16 and that he had instructed him ' to drive as fast as possible ' without saying why			1
but history records the probable reason			0
the day before his 23 - year - old half - niece @entity61 , with whom he lived and who he loved madly , shot herself with @entity10 's pistol at the @entity36 flat			1
it sent @entity10 into a profound depression and senior nazis on trial at @entity60 after the war said no other single incident during the whole of the @entity12 affected him more			2
historians speculate he was in something approaching a blind panic to get to @entity36 to begin the damage limitation exercise that he knew he must put in place to protect his burgeoning image as the saviour of @entity4			2
as to @entity31 , there is no indication that he ever advanced further in the police force for daring to send a summons to the future @entity29 of @entity4 .			1

documents reveal future @entity29 *claimed* his *lookalike* chauffeur @entity16 was driving at the time
@entity12 leader was travelling in personal supercharged @entity14 near @entity27 in 1931
may have been speeding back to @entity36 after half - niece shot herself in flat they shared
