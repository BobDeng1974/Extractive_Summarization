a suburban @entity1 school district has paid a private firm to monitor its students ' social media activities			1
the @entity5 last year hired the firm @entity6 to snoop the social media postings of the 14,000 or so students in the area to screen for any signs of bullying , self - harm , drug - use or violence , at a cost of $ 40,500			1
critics believe the screening sets a dangerous precedent and stifles free speech , but school district authorities and @entity6 say the purpose of the exercise is student safety			1
unaware : @entity25 students @entity26 ( left ) and @entity27 ( right ) , both 16 , only found out that their social media posts are being monitored by the @entity29 through media reports @entity6 provides @entity32 district officials with a daily report based on students ' post from social media platforms such as @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
the firm 's analysts search for terms that indicate violence , drug - use , bullying , self - harm or suicidal thoughts , racism and sexual harassment and alert the school district to anything untoward			1
however , the firm does not engage in hacking or tracking private correspondence , only monitoring public posts and comments			0
' all of the individual posts we monitor on social media networks are already made public by the students themselves			1
therefore , no privacy is violated , ' a @entity6 spokesperson told @entity65 , adding that the company does not ' monitor email , sms , @entity69 , phone calls , voicemails or unlock any privacy setting of a social network user			0
' cyber bullying : the @entity29 is seeking to nip online bullying in the bud by monitoring its students ' social media activity @entity6 ceo @entity79 says his firm was not given a list of children 's names , but the firm does n't disclose how the company deduces whether teens are students of the @entity32 district			1
@entity79 told @entity88 that the way kids communicate is different nowadays , and that the firm does n't spy on kids , but rather listens more effectively			0
two area students committed suicide last school year , including a 15 - year - old from @entity95 in the @entity96			2
following the tragic deaths , the @entity5 hired @entity6 for a pilot monitoring program of students from its three high schools , @entity32 , @entity101 and @entity102			2
according to @entity79 , the pilot program helped prevent the suicide of a student after the company alerted the district to worrying posts on social media , resulting in an intervention			1
following that success , the district contracted the firm for a full year			0
' we think it 's been working very well , ' superintendent @entity114 told the @entity117			0
' it 's designed around student safety and making sure kids are protected			0
' high school spies : according to @entity6 , students ' privacy is not invaded by the practice of social media monitoring , but some students disagree students were unaware their social media accounts were being spied on until media reports of the practice emerged			1
@entity131 student @entity27 told the @entity117 that he found out about the monitoring program on @entity37			0
' i heard rumors that @entity5 was doing a little bit of monitoring - but nothing as official as this , ' he said			2
' the only way students were finding out about it was through social media			1
our principal has n't said anything about it			0
' free speech advocates say school districts reading students ' social media posts is an invasion of the students ' privacy - especially if they 're punished for activities engaged in outside of school hours			1
@entity156 , senior staff attorney for the @entity157 , a nonprofit that defends privacy , free speech and consumer rights			1
told the @entity117 the program is essentially ' stalking ' school kids			2
' people say that 's not private : it 's public on @entity37			0
i say that 's just semantics			0
the question is what is the school doing ? it 's not stumbling into students - like a teacher running across a student on the street			2
this is the school sending someone to watch them			0
' communication skills : teens do a lot of their communicating online these days - which is why the @entity32 district says it 's necessary to monitor what students are saying on social media the response from @entity32 district students themselves are mixed			1
some feel anything that helps prevent bullying is a good thing			0
others expressed outrage that the district spent money on a monitoring program when other areas need funding			0
' @entity5 instead of paying 40k to stalk students uh ca n't y'all spend it on things that matter like @entity206 for the bathrooms and quality food , ' tweeted one			0
another @entity38 user said , ' @entity5 payin 40,500 for monitoring but we have like the worst campus , no class set textbooks , and teachers have @entity217 print out our own papers ? ' superintendent @entity114 will make an appearance at the school district 's @entity222 meeting later this month to discuss the program with parents and address any concerns .			2

@entity1 's @entity29 has been monitoring its 14,000 students ' social media accounts for about a year
authorities say the practice is necessary to ensure any *problems* , such as online bullying and self - harm , are identified
critics say the screening is essentially ' stalking ' and violates students ' right to free speech
