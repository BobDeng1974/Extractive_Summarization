it was good while it lasted , but nothing lasts forever			2
you may be the current @entity5 champion , even the reigning @entity6 champion , until sunday at least			1
but you have won nothing all year , you are 27 years old and the shades of night are falling fast			2
@entity11 tennis expects rather more from its heroes than a string of near - misses and might - have - beens			1
the old guard is changing , time to move aside			2
or so we were told			2
the reaction to @entity0 ’s defeat in the @entity6 quarter - finals carried the whiff of an epitaph			1
he had not merely lost a tennis match , he had disappointed his public , he had let the country down			2
worse , he had n’t behaved terribly well			2
video : scroll down to see fans react to @entity0 's @entity6 exit @entity29 : people were quick to criticise @entity0 after his quarter - final defeat to @entity32 at @entity6 aggressive : @entity0 is believed to have screamed foul - mouthed words during the straight - sets loss it was reported that the court - side photographers — innocent folk who are strangers to profanity — apparently heard him yell ‘ shut the f * * * up ! ’ in the direction of his box			1
the same delicate souls also claimed to have heard him shout “ five minutes before the f * * * * * g match ! ’ , when he was standing beneath the @entity44 , which was occupied at the time by the @entity46 and @entity47			2
my dear , the shock ! and the shame ! now nobody is justifying the cavalier use of industrial language , but the presence of royalty seems wholly irrelevant			2
@entity57 experienced seven - and - a-half years of full - time military service , while @entity47 is a graduate of the @entity59			2
it is just possible that they may have heard the charmless term a time or two before			0
@entity0 is the week ’s designated whipping boy , and as such he could expect no mercy			1
in fact , he behaved with genuine dignity in the aftermath of his loss			0
he paid handsome tribute to his conqueror , @entity32 : ‘ he was the better player from start to finish			1
’ he conceded his own shortcomings : ‘ i need to make some improvements to my game			0
’ he spoke of the need to ‘ work harder , get stronger and become physically better ’			0
and he offered this philosophical reflection : ‘ you can have bad days as an athlete			0
you do n’t win all the time			0
sometimes , you just have to take it on the chin and move on			0
’ class act : @entity0 was respectful to @entity32 after the match , typifying the champion he is disappointing : new coach @entity87 watches on at @entity88 on wednesday he could not have expressed himself more eloquently			1
and he spoke as an authentic achiever			0
@entity0 was the first @entity11 man in 77 years to win the singles title			1
he had won 23 of his previous 24 matches at @entity6 , his single defeat being inflicted by @entity94			1
he is ranked five in the world , while the next - best @entity96 is ranked 143rd			0
the state of @entity11 women ’s tennis is almost equally dire			1
they are the poor bloody infantry ; natural victims for whom the second week of a @entity102 tournament is a distant dream			0
at this level , @entity0 is our only player , certainly our only star			1
and he carries the burden pretty well			0
he faces the questions , tells his tale and asks to be judged by his performance on court			0
he is not the most avid attention - seeker in his sport ; indeed , he may not be the most avid in his own family			0
but he goes about his work with scrupulous diligence , he wins with grace and loses without recourse to trite excuse			0
he comes across as a serious man who has emerged into impressive maturity from a faintly gauche adolescence			2
waving goodbye for now : but @entity0 has matured well , and is carrying the state of @entity11 tennis on his shoulders shame : but he is still not fully accepted in this country yet still he is not fully accepted			1
he is too intense , too chippy , simply too @entity131 for the @entity133 crowd which sits in judgment on such matters			0
there is a suspicion that @entity6 has never really forgiven him for not being @entity138			1
in fact , @entity138 ’s verdict on @entity0 was a model of fairness and concision : ‘ there ’s not much to analyse ’ , he said			1
‘ @entity0 did n’t play well and his opponent took full advantage			1
’ but of course , we ca n’t leave it there			0
and so we hear that he surrendered rather too easily ; that he might have pushed himself a little more vigorously ; that he should have worked harder to retain his grip on the title			0
all this to the greatest tennis player that @entity11 has ever produced — and we must discount @entity156 ’s remarkable record on the grounds that he was playing a different sport with different equipment at a quite different pace			1
legendary : @entity0 is the greatest tennis player @entity11 has ever produced this time last year : @entity0 was the hero at @entity6 , and nobody would dare say a bad word about him @entity0 is a towering example of what may be achieved by a combination of immense natural talent and ferocious dedication			1
after generations of pointless poseurs who imagined that being no 1 in these islands represented the end of the rainbow , @entity0 taught us to reject the mundane , to raise our sights , to believe in better			1
yet despite all this , he is fatuously chastised , pushed aside long before his time			0
and all on account of a single defeat by an urgently emerging talent			0
i sense there is unfairness verging on injustice at work here , for the young man is possessed of a talent which @entity11 tennis scarcely recognises or deserves			1
reports of @entity0 ’s professional demise have been pitifully exaggerated			1
soon it will be time to revel in his rebirth .			0

the criticism of @entity0 after his @entity6 2014 exit is unfair
@entity11 no 1 was knocked out in straight sets by @entity32
but he was just beaten by the better man on the day , he will return
he is carrying the state of @entity11 tennis on his shoulders
made history last year by winning @entity6 on @entity88
he is the greatest player we have ever produced
