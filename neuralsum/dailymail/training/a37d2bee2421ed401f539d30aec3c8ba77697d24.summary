by @entity0 @entity1 , 24 , was left needing stitches to her lip and chin after allegedly being punched in the face by a taxi driver following a night out in @entity7 on july 27 these photos show the horrific injuries a woman suffered after being punched in the face by a rogue taxi driver following a night out			1
@entity1 , 24 , said she was assaulted by the taxi driver in an ' isolated ' street after she told him she did n't have enough money to pay the fare as he took her home on july 27			1
she had enjoyed several drinks with a friend in @entity19 prior to the incident and was on her way home at about 2.30am when the taxi driver allegedly locked the doors before driving to the random street			1
the insurance company worker said she realised during the drive home she did n't have enough money and asked the taxi driver to stop off at a cash point			1
however , he ended up dropping the two young women off in the secluded street – miles from home – before allegedly assaulting miss @entity1			2
she said : ' we had £ 14 but he wanted £ 20 so we asked him to take us to a cash point			1
' he refused , locked us in the cab and said he was going to take us back to where he collected us			0
' but in fact he dumped us in ( another road ) which was dark , but to be honest we were just glad to be able to get out the cab			0
' then as we walked away he got something out the boot of his car and sprayed us with water			0
' i went back to ask him why he had done that and it felt like he punched me in the face			2
' there was certainly a lot of force because it knocked me to the ground and i hit my face on the kerb			0
' the young women , from @entity56 , @entity7 , called the emergency services and police officers took @entity59 to hospital where she had several stitches to her lip and chin			1
however , the cabbie - which the girls believe was run by @entity67 and had an @entity69 driver who was in his 20s – drove off and police have been unable to track it down			1
miss @entity1 said she told the taxi driver she did n't have enough money to pay the fare as he took her home in @entity56 , @entity7 , and asked to be driven to a cash point			1
it was then he apparently punched her in the face @entity81 and @entity82 were informed of the incident but have now closed the investigation due to lack of evidence , infuriating @entity59 , who thinks they have done the ' bare minimum '			1
a force spokesman said : ' a thorough and detailed investigation was carried out based on the limited information and evidence available			2
' @entity92 was checked but there was no film showing the incident or a good shot of the actual taxi			0
' @entity99 - to - house investigations were also carried out and private @entity92 checked but no relevant footage was found			0
' because miss @entity1 has a right to complain if she feels we have not carried out a thorough investigation , this has been reported to the force 's professional standards department to review			2
' ms @entity1 has now gained the support of her local mp , @entity109 , who said : ' seeing the photos of this horrific , violent and cowardly attack on @entity1 has left me feeling sickened			2
@entity81 and @entity82 has closed an investigation into the case which miss @entity1 blasted them for , saying they had done the ' bare minimum '			1
she now has the support of mps who said the attack was ' cowardly ' ' this is the second attack that has been brought to my attention regarding taxi drivers becoming violent and assaulting their passengers			0
' with all the cctv we have in @entity7 this should be being picked up			0
' mp @entity128 added : ' taxis should be seen as a place of safety for people , not a place where you risk being assaulted			0
' it seems sad but perhaps we need to encourage people to note down taxi licence numbers when they get in a taxi			0
