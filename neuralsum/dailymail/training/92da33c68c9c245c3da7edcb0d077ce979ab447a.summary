by @entity0 published : 04:47 est , 31 august 2012 updated : 11:24 est , 31 august 2012 for some , her unconventional lifestyle proved to be an eyesore			2
while for others it offered a romantic image of the vagrant ' rag lady ' surviving against the odds			2
but now homeless former concert pianist @entity9 is devastated after workmen pulled down the makeshift shelter she has lived in for the last decade			1
tearful miss @entity9 , 75 , said it was ' wanton , wicked vandalism ' after she discovered the men from @entity16 tearing down her den at @entity18 in @entity19 , west @entity20			1
the @entity21 of @entity19 : @entity9 , now 75 , sits among a pile of rubbish several years ago after workmen destroyed a previous shelter she had been living in over the last ten years , the pensioner - known as the rag lady of @entity19 - had become used to bedding down in the undergrowth and cultivated a small bed of shrubs , plants and fruit trees			1
despite offers of shelter and charity , she continued living among the vegetation while surviving on scraps of food and the occasional snack from nearby cherry and plum trees			2
her future on the embankment now looks uncertain after the @entity46 workers this week cut back the trees and put up a security fence to keep out vandals			2
' it 's wanton , wicked vandalism , ' miss @entity9 told the @entity52			1
' this was a lovely patch of garden			2
i was doing nobody any harm			2
it seems that if they do n't like the look of something they can just knock it all down			0
' miss @entity9 wanders along the street with bags on her feet while carrying a few possessions the blue @entity69 consul from the 1960s that miss @entity9 had lived in after being kicked out of her flat is towed away in march 2002 in a move that bitterly divided neighbors this satellite image shows the tube station where @entity76 has been bedding down , just a short distance from @entity78 where she used to live in a flat miss @entity9 once played at @entity79 in central @entity20 and was tipped to be one of the greatest pianists of her generation			1
but after a man ' broke her heart ' her life went into freefall and she was evicted from her flat in leafy @entity87 , in @entity19			1
aged 39 , she began sleeping in her blue @entity89 in echoes of miss @entity91 from the @entity92 play @entity93 in the @entity94			1
but ten years ago neighbours began to complain about her and her car was towed away			1
she built a similar shelter in a car park piled high with earth and compost from skips - sprouts fuchsias , geraniums , wallflowers and pansies donated by locals and garden centres			1
miss @entity9 's plight has echoes of @entity92 's play lady in the @entity94			1
the story is based on his own experience of an eccentric elderly woman called miss @entity91 who lived on his driveway in run - down vans over the course of 15 years			1
@entity92 , who stars as himself , eventually builds up a friendship with miss @entity91			1
miss @entity91 camped close to his home in @entity118 , north @entity20 , just ten miles from @entity19 where @entity76 lives			1
the most striking similarity is that miss @entity91 was also a musician who took to living on the streets after running into financial problem			1
the play has been written for stage , radio , published as a book and released in an essay form			1
it is one of @entity92 's most popular productions and continues to be staged at theatres across the country			1
then that was also ripped down by council workers who believed it to be wasteland			0
it was then that she is believed to have found her small patch of land on the embankment of the underground station			1
her day normally begins when she wakes at her shelter , washes in public toilets and cleans her clothes with a hosepipe at a petrol station			2
they are wrapped in newspaper to dry			0
she spends her mornings wandering among shops picking rubbish from bins to feed herself and the pigeons			0
she regularly listens in on court cases , indulging an interest in law held since childhood			0
once a week she immerses herself in books and scores at @entity162 music library - her only concession to her former life , of which she refuses to speak			2
but miss @entity9 now says she is uncertain about how her lfie will continue			1
she said she was stunned when she saw her ' home ' being knocked down			0
she added : ' i started screaming : '' police , police ! '' i could n't understand what had happened			0
i thought it was beautiful			0
why would anyone do something like that ? ' neighbour @entity175 said she found miss @entity9 ' trembling with shock ' and crying			1
they claim that the clearing by @entity16 had little to do with ' safety concerns '			0
@entity181 added : ' this is her house			0
she is a valued member of the community who deserves much better than this uncaring treatment			0
' friends say she has money - she was one of the shareholders to benefit from a windfall when the @entity191 building society became a bank in the early @entity193 - but offers of accommodation and charity are refused			0
speaking about the last time her shack was destroyed , she said : ' i 've had so many hardships in my life , so many disappointments and failures			2
you would n't call me one of life 's successes			2
you do what you can			0
' i made a little square in the corner of the asphalt to do my cooking			0
every time i cooked the fire would melt away a bit more asphalt and , little by little , i chipped it away			0
' @entity16 said the work was being carried out to replace a damaged section of fencing that posed a security risk			0
a spokesman added : ' earlier this week , some contractors , working on our behalf , near @entity18 removed some overgrown vegetation to replace a section of damaged fencing			0
this damage was a risk to the security of the railway and the safety of any intruder			0
' the contractors were not aware of the special significance this piece of land had for @entity76 and their primary concern was dealing with a safety critical issue			0
obviously we very much regret the distress caused to @entity76			0
' mrs @entity9 made her home in the shadow of the @entity246 line near @entity18 station			1

@entity9 , 75 , has survived at side of station for the last decade
once tipped as star pianist but life *collapsed* after *heartbreak* in 1970s
lived in her car for 20 years like miss @entity91 in @entity92 play
