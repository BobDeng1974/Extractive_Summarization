younger sibling , @entity10 , 26 , terrified she 'd be the ' fat sister ' signed up too by @entity11 published : 08:36 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 18:22 est , 8 january 2013 @entity0 , 29 , was shamed into shedding the stones after a woman offered her a seat on her morning commute - mistakenly thinking she was pregnant			1
embarrassed @entity0 hit the gym and began a strict diet - and the pounds were soon melting away			0
and when her younger sister , @entity10 , 26 , saw how much weight she 'd shed , she decided to sign up to the same diet - terrified she 'd be known as the ' fat sister '			1
after six months of spurring each other on through the tough times , the sisters , from @entity21 , @entity22 , have lost almost 10 stone between them - and can now both slip into a size 10			0
older sister @entity0 pictured before and after remarkable weight loss @entity0 said : ' we have always been bigger than our other sisters - we are both quite tall so we 've always just thought we are not meant to be skinny people			1
' i 'd noticed i was struggling to fit in my size 18 clothes , but it was n't until the day someone assumed i was pregnant that i actually did anything about my weight			1
' i 'd managed to find a dress that i thought was quite flattering , but as soon as i stepped onto the train this lady looked at my stomach , smiled and offered me her seat			2
' i could have died of embarrassment			0
i could n't bring myself to tell her that i was n't pregnant , so i just said that i was getting off at the next stop			0
' i went straight home in tears - and the first thing i did was log onto my computer and start looking up diets			0
younger sister @entity10 pictured before and after her impressive weight loss @entity0 said she noticed she was struggling to fit in size 18 clothes , ' but it was n't until the day someone assumed i was pregnant that i actually did anything about my weight ' ' i remembered seeing @entity6 had lost weight on the @entity5 , so i signed up the same day			1
' within a few weeks , retail manager @entity0 had lost more than a stone - and was the envy of her younger sister			1
and after realising that @entity0 was melting away before her eyes , @entity10 also pledged to sign up to @entity66 - and like her sister , started shedding the pounds			1
since joining the plan in july , 5ft 8in @entity0 has lost a staggering four and a half stone - shrinking from a whopping 15st 12lb and struggling to squeeze into a size 18 dress to a slender 11st 6lb - and a size 10 to 12			2
and sister @entity10 , who is 6ft tall , now weighs just 12st 2lb - after originally tipping the scales at just under 17st			2
the sisters say : ' our mum is so proud of us - she ca n't believe how much weight we have lost ' @entity10 , a teaching assistant , said : ' we 've both managed to keep on track thanks to a bit of sisterly competition			1
' when we were bigger , we used to convince each other that we were never supposed to be skinny girls - that we did n't have the skinny gene			0
' but now , we 've started to convince each other that there 's no reason we ca n't fit into a size 10 - and we 've helped each other get there			0
' we were inconstant competition to keep up with each other 's weight loss , and that kept us going			0
' @entity0 added : ' one night when our weight loss had had slowed a bit , i remember standing at the fridge , rummaging for chocolate			2
' then my phone beeped with a message , and it was @entity10 saying she 'd lost four pounds that week - i slammed the fridge shut straight away			1
' we 've both joined a gym and we try to go to work out together - it 's so much easier when there 's someone else egging you on			0
' if you 'd told us both we 'd have been going to a gym a year ago we 'd have both said you were mad - but it 's true ! ' our mum is so proud of us - she ca n't believe how much weight we have lost			2
' we keep getting compliments wherever we go and it 's a great feeling			0
' over @entity114 , we actually lost weight , rather than put it on - it was amazing			2
' i 'm sure we 'll help each other motivated enough to keep it off too			0
