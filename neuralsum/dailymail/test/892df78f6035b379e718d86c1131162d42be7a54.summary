when @entity1 loaned out her beloved horse magic to help a young girl learn to ride , she did n't realise she would never see him again			1
miss @entity1 , 21 , was horrified to discover that the family looking after @entity6 had sold him at auction for just £ 200			1
@entity6 's fate has sparked fury in the equestrian community , and an appeal for his whereabouts has been shared 58,000 times on social media sites			0
@entity1 , 21 , was shocked to discover the family she loaned her beloved pet horse magic to had sold the animal ( pictured right and left being ridden by @entity19 ) for £ 200 selling a horse at auction is notoriously risky – bidders are not vetted and some horses are bought for slaughter			1
miss @entity1 said : ' we would never in a million years have considered sending @entity6 to auction – they 're horrible places			1
the thought makes me cry			0
' it was two months before she discovered the horse had been sold – making it all the more difficult to trace @entity6 , who could have been taken out of the country or sold to an abattoir			1
miss @entity1 , who had owned the 17 - year - old chestnut pony for seven years , said : ' i consider him like a child , he thinks of me as his mum and he 's been taken from me			1
' he could be anywhere by now , i do n't know how to find him and even if we do , what state will he be in ? ' the care assistant from @entity46 , @entity47 , advertised for a temporary owner last year after the cost of his upkeep went over £ 4,000 a year			2
a woman in the @entity52 responded and took @entity6 to help her daughter improve her riding			0
miss @entity1 pictured with her new horse lad after her previous pet was sold at auction without her knowledge miss @entity1 said : ' he was getting very expensive			1
loaning a horse is common for people who ca n't afford the expense of the purchase but can afford the upkeep			2
so while they do n't have ownership , they have a duty of care			0
the woman i loaned to seemed very respectable and said she wanted her 12 - year - old daughter to get more experience riding			2
' but after six months , @entity6 's temporary owner said keeping the pony was too expensive and he was proving too difficult for her daughter to ride			2
they agreed that she would help miss @entity1 look for an experienced rider to buy him for £ 500			1
but just 12 days later , on february 10 , @entity6 was auctioned			0
however , miss @entity1 did not find out until last week when she decided to bring @entity6 home			2
' he has always been treated like a prince , so being fought over at an auction by a crowd looking for a quick deal makes me sick			0
' her mother @entity86 , 53 , said the woman had no right to auction @entity6 , adding : ' the arrangement was that if she had any interested parties , she would pass them to me			0
' in no way was @entity6 to be sold without our knowledge			0
' last night , the seller insisted there was ' another side to the story ' , but declined to comment further .			0
