by @entity0 published : 10:37 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 13:52 est , 9 january 2013 at a fleeting glance , these pictures look like a windsurfer impressively speeding across choppy waters			0
but on closer inspection this is n't your standard windsurfer - he 's skating across sheets of thick ice			1
@entity13 @entity12 clearly is n't one to be deterred by sub-zero temperatures from showing off his impressive surfing skills			1
@entity16 : @entity13 @entity17 sailor @entity12 takes to the ice on @entity19 , @entity20 , to show off his ice windsurfing skills athlete : @entity12 is slightly more accustomed to the water than the ice - he competed in the men 's laser class sailing at last summer 's @entity27 and the 2008 games in @entity29 perfect conditions : @entity13 can only skate on the lake for one week of the year when the ice is thick enough and the snow is not too deep he took to the ice on @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity13 , to take part in the extreme sport and reach frightening speeds of almost 40mph			1

every pixel has to count , to leave its mark and emotion			0
' in sports photography i look for action , strength and a challenge			0
i like to seize the moment in the heart of the battle			0
stunning : ice at the vast frozen lake is between 15 and 20 cm thick when ice surfers take to it each year balance : surfers keep their balance by using smaller boards than when windsurfing and attaching ice skating - type blades to the bottom of the board dangerous : @entity12 dangles perilously close to the ice as he reaches speeds of almost 40mph on the lake ' then i concentrate on the faces , muscles and on the details that give the idea of the effort and strain being exerted			1
' a picture is worth something when it can give you an emotion every time you look at it			0
' the sport , invented by frustrated @entity87 windsurfers during a particularly harsh winter , is something of a hybrid of wind surfing , ice yachting and snow boarding			1
riders can reach staggering speeds of 70mph and - like windsurfing - there are no brakes			1
the @entity13 ice speed record is a slightly slower 55mph			0
some ice windsurfers even claim to have hit 90mph on a particularly windy day			2
a smaller board is used than regular windsurfing and riders balance and glide by attaching ice - skate type blades to the bottom			2
@entity13 can only windsurf on the lake for one week each year when the ice , at 15 - 20cm deep , is thick enough and the snow is not too deep			1
