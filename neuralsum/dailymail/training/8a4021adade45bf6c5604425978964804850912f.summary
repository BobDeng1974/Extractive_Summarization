as a zoologist , explorer and nature programme presenter , i ’ve always loved animals			1
but when it comes to picking a favourite , i ’m not interested in the usual furry pandas or cheeky meerkats			2
no , in my opinion , the best animals by far are sloths — nature ’s most misunderstood creature			1
sloths get a lot of undeserved bad press			2
let ’s face it , being named after one of the seven deadly sins was never going to be a good start			2
so spa so good : sloths with skin problems take the occasional splash in green tea , which keeps their skin healthy			2
they 're surprisingly good swimmers , but do n't like bathtime and often look very sorry for themselves they spend more than 70 per cent of their time resting and move incredibly slowly , which means they ’re often dismissed as lazy and stupid			2
but their chilled - out nature is what helps them to survive in the jungles of @entity38 , their native habitat			0
they are the masters of staying silent and hidden from predators			0
beyond the pail : buckets are the sloth 's favourite way to travel at the sanctuary			1
it 's fast and means they can snooze on the move			0
naturally solitary in the wild , they 're paired up with a sloth ' cuddle partner ' when they arrive at the sanctuary , and enjoy chilling out together toy story : babies cling to their mothers for the first 12 months before going it alone , so orphaned sloths get stuffed toys to hug instead			1
@entity61 refuses to be separated from his giraffe called mr @entity63 @entity65 style : these little chaps ca n't control their own body temperature like other mammals , and nights can be chilly for the orphans without a mummy to cling to			0
so the sanctuary make special onesies , crafted from sports socks , to keep them cosy they ’ve been around for a long time , too : fossils have revealed some of their ancestors grew to the size of elephants , had claws and ate leaves much like the present - day versions			1
these cuddly couch potatoes are among the smartest , eco-friendliest , cutest and most amazing animals on the planet			1
and i ’m on a one - woman mission to prove it			1
i ’m so passionate about these tree - hugging balls of fluff that in 2010 , i travelled thousands of miles from my home in @entity94 to @entity95 , where i visited the @entity97 sloth sanctuary — the world ’s first sanctuary for injured and orphaned sloths — to meet 150 of them			1
hanging tough : sloths in the wild spend their lives hanging in trees			0
their long arms and four - inch curved claws keep them hooked to the branches			0
babies at the sanctuary have a daily workout on the climbing frame safe and snuggly : orphans often arrive with broken bones after falling from trees or being hit by cars , so the sanctuary has its own ' slothspital ' to treat injuries your cue : sloths do everything upside down - eating , sleeping , mating , giving birth - and climb down from the trees just once a week to answer the call of nature			1
so playing a trick shot on the pool table is no problem founded 20 years ago , the sanctuary cares for sloths who have fallen from trees ( either breaking bones or being separated from the mothers they ’d normally cling to for the first year of life ) , been the victim of attacks by dogs or even run over on the roads that cut across their natural jungle habitat			1
there , i fell in love with their sweet smiles , slow - mo lifestyles and innate hugability			0
i vowed to change public attitudes , making people see that being slothful is a virtue , not a sin			1
i ’ve since made a documentary about them called meet the sloths for the @entity160 channel			0
where 's @entity162 ? this little fellow was rescued by locals and named @entity162			0
he took a long time to learn how to climb upwards			0
however , he has n't yet learned to reverse , and often has to be rescued from the top of the climbing frame by members of staff basket case : in the wild , sloths eat leaves that would poison other animals - it takes their stomachs four weeks to digest each meal , breaking down the toxins			2
so , while they might look lazy , inside their bodies are hard at work i ’ve also launched the @entity182 , and even created sloth fans along the way , such as @entity185 and actor @entity186 , who have spread the word about these wonderful animals on @entity190			1
now , i ’m sharing my @entity192 photo albums with the world in a new book , @entity195			0
once you ’ve read it , i promise you ’ll never look at these mellow fellows in the same light			0
not convinced ? let me talk you through some of my favourite snaps ... the @entity195 is published by @entity202 , £ 7.99			0

the @entity97 sloth sanctuary in @entity95 is home to *hundreds* of the *abandoned* animals
these adorable animals are some of smartest and most eco-friendly on the planet
@entity212 is on mission to change opinions on misunderstood animals
