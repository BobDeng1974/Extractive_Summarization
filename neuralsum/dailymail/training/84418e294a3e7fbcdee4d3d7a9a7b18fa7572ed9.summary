@entity0 celebrated his move to @entity2 with the winning goal as @entity4 heaped more misery on @entity6 flops @entity7			1
the former @entity9 frontman climbed off the bench to bag the only goal of the game 16 minutes from time when he thumped the ball past @entity15 to earn @entity17 ' side a deserved victory at the @entity19			1
@entity7 dominated possession but they failed to muster a single shot on target as @entity24 was a virtual bystander between the @entity26 sticks			1
goals : @entity56 @entity7 : @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity38 , @entity59 , @entity37 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity44 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64			0
following a disastrous @entity6 campaign , @entity65 looked to the new generation after midfield duo @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 decided to hang up their boots on the international stage			0
however , it was @entity4 who appeared the more dangerous on the counter attack in the first half in @entity79			0
@entity53 was a constant thorn in @entity7 's side			1
he had the first sight of goal that was easily saved by @entity57 , then failed to get a proper connection when the ball dropped to him in the box			0
@entity45 shot straight at @entity57 , while @entity54 's thumping effort hit @entity90 square in the face			0
rebuilding job : @entity65 's new - look spain side offered very little danger man : @entity4 frontman @entity53 sees a shot well saved by @entity15 blinded by the lights : @entity34 ( left ) and @entity7 's @entity58 attempt to win the ball with their eyes closed old head : @entity4 full - back @entity50 vies for possession with @entity58 chalked off : @entity53 's effort was ruled out by the linesman 's flag @entity53 forced a good save out of the @entity108 man before the break , but eventually had the ball in the net at the beginning of the second half when he converted @entity33 's perfectly - weighted cross			1
however , the @entity116 frontman was wrongly denied by the linesman 's flag as the visitors escaped once again			0
@entity7 failed to create any clear - cut chances and a frustrated @entity41 was withdrawn midway through the second half along with @entity2 team - mate @entity62			1
however , while it was agony for two @entity124 stars , it was ecstacy for another minutes later			2
@entity33 's flick played in @entity34 , and he cut the ball back for sub @entity0 to crash the ball past @entity57 from eight yards into the top corner			2
@entity7 rallied , but @entity131 failed to take a couple of chances to equalise as they slipped to another defeat ahead of their opening @entity137 qualifying campaign			2
video we 're growing in confidence - @entity53			0

@entity0 shows @entity124 team - mate @entity41 how it 's done after climbing off bench to score only goal of the game
goal rounds off fine week for the @entity26 frontman following his *£* *10.5million* move to @entity149
new - look @entity7 side failed to shine as @entity65 's stars could *n't* muster a single shot on target
