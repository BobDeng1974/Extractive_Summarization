by @entity0 @entity2 's only deckchair manufacturer is working flat out this summer due to the glorious weather and rising temperatures			1
@entity5 , 54 , designs and builds the classic sun loungers which are so in demand they are snapped up for use on most beaches across the country			1
his @entity12 business sells several thousand of the traditional recliners every year and is doing a roaring trade during this seaside season thanks to the heatwaves			2
no time to lounge around this year : @entity5 has turned his love of the seaside stalwart into a thriving business that now numbers @entity21 , @entity22 and even @entity23 amongst his customers @entity5 's passion for the deckchair began in 1981 when he was a student , and used to work as a beach attendant			1
after university he struggled to find work and instead launched his own business renting the seats out to members of the public			0
he then bought two old furniture manufacturing machines dating back to before the @entity35 , that had been altered to make deckchairs			0
branching into clothing : @entity23 stock shirts based on traditional deckchair patterns over the last 20 years @entity5 has refined the process and he is now the only producer of them in the @entity2			1

@entity5 said : ' it began in 1981 when i was at the @entity51 and i worked as a beach attended throughout the summers and really enjoyed it			2
' after university i struggled to find work and did n't know what to do , so i applied through the council and set up a business renting out deckchairs to people			0
seaside chic : @entity5 has also lent his deckchair design to making accessories like these bags ' after about a year the chairs were getting ropey but new ones were really expensive , and then i heard about some old machines that were going			1
' i put the machines in a rented workshop and started trying making the deckchairs myself , i eventually got them going and the first one took three weeks to do			2
' i started selling them to local councils across the country and since then it has gone from strength to strength			0
' when i first started selling deckchairs it was something that was on the decline because since the 1960s package holidays had taken over			0
iconic red stripes : a model wears one of the new @entity23 designs turning back the clock : @entity5 as a deckchair attendant on @entity90 beach in 1983 ' people were leaving holidays at seaside resorts like @entity94 and @entity95 in favour of trips to @entity98 , usually @entity99			1
' the resorts were almost preserved as they were and feel like they have been in a time warp and that 's why @entity105 seasides are so lovely			2
' with the nice weather i think we could see a boom in sales , especially as they seem to appeal to the younger generation now which could be because of the vintage trend			0
