aged just 32 and weighing 24st 7 lb at a size 32 , @entity9 was warned she would not live to see her 40th birthday unless she lost weight @entity9 , pictured after her weight loss and surgery to remove six pounds of skin which bought her total weight loss to 14st , will wear a bikini in public for the first time on her 40th birthday @entity9 , a health care worker in a nursery school , said : ‘ i worked so hard to lose all the weight on my own but being left with all that skin was awful			1
‘ it was like wearing a permanent rubber ring of skin around my waist			1
‘ i used to wear two pairs of tights to try and smooth it down but nothing could flatten it			0
‘ but now i ’m about to turn 40 and in the best shape of my life which is not bad considering i was once told i was so fat that would n't live to see it			1
’ @entity9 began struggling with her weight as a teenager			1
when she started her first job as a trainee hairdresser she admits spending all her money on takeaways			2
she explains : ‘ it was a special treat to have a take away so when i started earning my own money i started treating myself			2
‘ i ’d have chips or an @entity64 meal for supper after work			0
’ but soon she was spending money on bacon rolls for breakfast and fish and chips for lunch too			0
she was already a size 20 weighing 17st when she met engineer husband @entity24			2
@entity9 from @entity74 , says : ‘ he was n’t bothered about my weight at all so after we got together i just kept on eating and growing			1
locked in a cycle of self - loathing and comfort eating @entity9 's weight continued to rise and she became breathless even from walking despite wishing to slim she just could n't ditch the take away meals - until later that year her doctor delivered a stark warning four years later the couple holidayed in the @entity85 with @entity9 weighing 24 stone and a dress size 26			1
she says : ‘ i was sweating buckets the whole time we were there			0
i tried to cover up in t - shirts but that just made me ever hotter			2
‘ i was so big even walking left me out of breath			0
i watched the other women on the beach in bikinis and wished it was me			0
’ but all attempts to diet failed as @entity9 was locked in a cycle of self - loathing and comfort eating			1
she was even bigger when the couple flew to @entity105 on holiday in 2000 @entity9 was mortified to need a seat belt extension on the flight			1
she recalls : ‘ it was so embarrassing			0
i was worried i would n’t even be able to fit into the seat			0
’ but there was more shame to come when she realised she was too fat to fit into any of the rides at @entity114			0
she says : ‘ i was queuing for a rollercoaster when staff took me to one side and said i needed to sit in the sample seat to make sure i would fit			2
‘ i followed them and sat down but the seat belt would n’t close			0
i was told i was too big to ride			2
’ she fled and was too embarrassed to try any other rides			0
‘ i knew it would be the same			0
i could n’t believe we had wasted so much money going there			0
’ but it was in 2003 , the year she married @entity24 , that her weight peaked and she reached a dress size 32			1
she says she tried almost every bridal shop in @entity130 looking for a dress in her size and eventually had to order one from @entity134			2
she says : ‘ even then it was so tight i could barely breath and being so uncomfortable ruined the day			0
’ the years of overeating had left a giant flap of skin known as an apron hanging from her stomach and she was told she would need surgery to remove it but she was mortified when in 2006 a child at the school where she worked drew a picture of her as a big round blob			1
@entity9 says : ‘ she gave it to me as a present and i just took it home and cried			1
bless her she had no idea it had upset me but she was right , that was how i looked			0
’ but despite wishing to slim she just could n’t ditch the take away meals - until later that year her doctor delivered a stark warning			2
aged just 32 and weighing 24st 7 lb , @entity9 was warned she would not live to see her 40th birthday unless she lost weight			1
she recalls : ‘ he did n’t mince his words			0
he said i would suffer a heart attack and die unless i lost weight			2
’ @entity9 ate a strict diet of only fresh fruit , vegetables and lean meat to drop the pounds he offered to refer her for gastric surgery but @entity9 was determined to try again to lose the weight herself			1
this time she joined a local slimming club and in the first week in january 2007 lost a stone			0
the diet involved eating only fresh fruit , vegetables and lean meat			1
@entity9 says : ‘ i had n’t eaten like that for years and was surprised to actually enjoy it			1
’ it took four years for @entity9 to lose 13st 7lb and reach her goal weight of 11st			1
she says : ‘ i set little goals and worked towards them			0
it took years to get that big i knew it would n’t come off overnight			2
’ finally in 2011 she reached a size 12			2
she says : ‘ i felt fantastic and was happy in my clothes but underneath that there was a problem			0
’ the years of overeating had left a giant flap of skin known as an apron hanging from her stomach over her pubic area			1
@entity9 was so ashamed of it she rarely let her husband see her naked and was still unable to wear clothes she liked			1
she tried to disguise it with spanx and even considered wrapping it in cling film			0
but even worse were repeated skin infections caused by the folds of flesh rubbing together			2
she says : ‘ it would get very sweaty and inflamed and my gp was always prescribing antibiotics and creams to calm it down			0
‘ i never regretted losing the weight but i felt disappointed that i could n’t enjoy it as i hoped because of the skin			1
i just hoped if i kept exercising it would go			0
’ eventually in 2012 she spoke to her gp who confirmed her worst fears , that the skin would need to be surgically removed			2
he referred her for the procedure known as an apronectomy , but before being given the green light @entity9 first needed to demonstrate that she would indeed keep the weight off			1
@entity9 , pictured with her husband @entity24 , went bikini shopping for the first time in her life just weeks after her surgery , snapping up four different costumes to wear on a holiday to mark her 40th she said : ‘ i had maintained for a long time by then so i was confident that i would pass the interview			1
