by @entity0 a blogger well known for her stance on body image issues , as well as her own experience with body dysmorphia , has petitioned @entity6 , ceo of @entity7 , to stop using painfully thin models in its campaigns			1
@entity11 , a 48 - year - old mother of two pre-teen daughters , was outraged when she stumbled across a @entity7 ad campaign in @entity14 last month , starring what appears to her to be a severely ' malnourished ' model			1
' my first reaction was , what the hell ? ' she writes on her blog @entity22 , labeling the image ' cruel ' , both to the model ' if she is n't naturally thin ' , and to the young girls who will be exposed to it			1
' she goes on to point out that less two per cent of all women ( and men ) in the @entity43 are genetically inclined to be this thin naturally			1
' this means 98 per cent of women would have to deprive themselves in order to achieve this look , ' she laments			1
inspired by a 16 - year - old girl who successfully petitioned @entity49 to stop photoshopping their models , mrs @entity35 launched her own on @entity52 , and quickly amassed over 40,000 signatures			1
' we request that you stop using images depicting models who may be malnourished or have a dangerously low @entity60 , ' the petition reads			2
high fashion : mrs @entity35 considers the images ' cruel ' both to the model ( pictured in another shot from the same campaign ) and to the impressionable girls who are exposed to it it goes on to suggest that booking these girls is sending a message to other models that they have to be ' uber thin to get work ' and to lead young girls and women into ' serious eating disorders ' , some of which may result in death			2
a representative for @entity7 was unavailable for comment when contacted by @entity82			2
mrs @entity35 is already known for her vocal stance on issues surrounding body image			1
in 2012 , at the age of 46 , she stripped down to recreate a nude photo shoot she had taken part in some 20 years ago , posting the images from both side - by - side , along with her own surprised reaction			2
' who is that fat , dimpled , wrinkly , broad - flanked person ? that is n't me ? that ca n't be me ? ? ! ! ' she wrote in her piece for the @entity99			2
she later made her peace with her age - morphed body shape and is evidently now keen to make changes to the industry she believes , in part , spawned her negative self - image			1
naked ambition : mrs @entity35 posed nude at 25 when she hated her body ( left ) and again at 46 ( right ) and was herself horrified by the more recent photographs the passage of time : the mother - of - two has since accepted the skin she lives in but is trying to make changes to the industry she feels prompted her body dimorphic disorder in the first place it 's not a belief shared by fellow blogger - and incidental friend - @entity121 , who penned a rebuttal to @entity124 's petition , which was later published on the @entity99 , entitled , do n't make the @entity125			1
' my problem is that we do n't know that this young woman is actually anorexic , ' she writes			2
' is n’t assuming all skinny girls are anorexic just as bad as assuming all bigger girls are unhealthy ? ' ms @entity121 , also a mother of two , and a former self - confessed member of the two per cent elite , claims she had been naturally thin all her life ( until she had two children , she points out ) and suffered repeated accusations of anorexia as well as being branded ' toothpick , ' ' boobless , ' and a ' stick figure			2
' ' i ate four large meals a day , numerous snacks , and spent several months on weight gain shakes so the name calling would stop			2
it did n’t , ' she recalls			2
clash : ms @entity146 ( right ) wrote a rebuttal to @entity124 's ( left ) petition , arguing that banning thin models is n't the answer and that we should be demanding all body types to be represented instead ms @entity146 admits that being thin did ' open doors ' to a short but lucrative career as a fashion model and tells @entity82 that she ' absolutely ' misses her naturally skinny days			1
however , as she struggles to feel completely comfortable with her post-baby body , she does n't blame the media for making her feel pressured			1
' @entity159 thin models and calling them anorexic is n’t the answer			0
thin - ness is n’t the enemy – exclusivity is , ' she argues			0
' instead of banning one body type , we should instead be demanding all body types			1
' she pointed to @entity169 as one of the companies leading the departure from favoring ' a certain body type ' to include women of all shapes and sizes , and believes the industry is changing			1
@entity159 thin models and calling them anorexic is n’t the answer			0
instead of banning one body type , we should instead be demanding all body types			1
ms @entity146 sparked a heated debate on what @entity124 described as her ' skinny bashing ' , with many readers hitting back at her standpoint			0
' thin women who occasionally receive negative feedback from their thinness can cry me a river , ' responded one			0
' you look sickly and bony and if others try to emulate you they run the risk of becoming sick too , ' commented another			0
ms @entity121 subsequently wrote a follow up piece on her blog , @entity197 and she stood her ground			0
' dissecting and judging someone else 's body , and then using that to pass judgement on them and their life as a whole should not be acceptable , ' she wrote , suggesting that this was not taking the right path toward ' promoting healthy body image			1
' ever since waifish supermodel @entity209 exploded onto the scene in the late nineties with her lean ' heroin - chic ' aesthetic , a new standard was born and the debate on what should be acceptable in the fashion industry has raged ever since			0
following intense pressure , there have been repeated efforts in the past on behalf on key fashion influencers to buck the accusations that they are irresponsibly leading young women into eating disorders			0
@entity225 banned size zero models from her @entity229 show in 2010 , while the @entity231 fashion houses @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234 have all said they have done the same			0
@entity235 : @entity209 , pictured here in 1992 , sparked the long - enduring skinny trend when she first hit supermodel stardom , causing a debate that has raged for decades and in 2012 @entity241 editors from across the globe , led by @entity243 , pledged to ban the use of models under 16 in photo shoots and promised not to use models they know to be suffering from eating disorders			0
still , true to form , this year 's @entity250 featured a number of excruciatingly thin models , including @entity254 winner , 21 - year - old @entity253 , who faced a bitter backlash for her noticeably gaunt appearance at @entity258 's @entity257			0
in line with ms @entity146 , the model hit back at her critics , posting a photo to her @entity264 account yesterday of her breakfast , which included two butter croissants and a banana			0
' love my job , love food , i am who i am , deal with it ' [ sic ] she wrote alongside it			0
courting controversy : model @entity253 faced a recent backlash after appearing at this year 's @entity250 looking skeletal , in spite of many designers and fashion editors promising over the years not to promote an irresponsible ideal in the case of @entity124 's blog post on the @entity7 ad , the writer later tweaked her rhetoric ' in order to be more respectful to the model in the photo ' - but the petition stands			0
' i still think my petition has value and is important for the 99 per cent of women who are not underweight in @entity43 , ' she writes			0
as for relationship between the opposing friends and bloggers , ms @entity146 says to @entity82 : ' i think @entity11 and i share the same goal , which is to see a wider range of bodies represented in the fashion industry and media			1
' just under 5,000 more signatures are required for @entity124 to reach her target of 50,000 , and she says that if she is successful in her mission , she intends to begin a movement to get all advertisers to use healthy woman , ' one ad campaign at a time			0

@entity11 has spoken publicly of her own struggles with body dysmorphic disorder
