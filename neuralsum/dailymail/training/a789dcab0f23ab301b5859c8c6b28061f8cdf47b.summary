by @entity0 parking wardens could be dishing out higher fines after transport secretary @entity3 said the current price may not be enough of a ' deterrent ' parking fines could rise by as much as £ 50 because the current cap on charges may not act as enough as a ' deterrent ' for drivers			1
currently , motorists outside @entity12 pay a maximum of £ 70 for a parking fine but transport secretary @entity3 said this is under review			1
it means drivers could be forced to pay as much as £ 130 for a parking ticket - if the @entity12 charge cap is introduced around the country			1
mr @entity3 confirmed to mps at the transport select committee meeting yesterday that a review on fines is underway - the first on charges outside of @entity12 since 2001			1
he said @entity29 have faced escalating fines after both @entity31 and @entity32 increased the cap			2
however , fines outside the capital have remained static			2
the @entity37 mp said : ' it can be argued that if the cost of legitimate parking rises to such a degree that the penalty no longer becomes a deterrent then that should be looked at ' , he was quoted in @entity44 as saying			1
the review has been criticised by motorist groups			0
@entity47 , president of the @entity48 , told @entity44 : ' our concern would be that local authorities become reliant on the fines as income '			0
he added there was a danger local authorities use parking fines as a source of revenue rather than a measure to prevent illegal parking			0
mr @entity3 admitted that any rise would prove unpopular with drivers , who are already being squeezed at the pumps			1
@entity29 have faced rising fines - currently capped at £ 130 - but charges elsewhere have remained static mr @entity3 admitted increasing the fines may ' send out the wrong message ' he told @entity22 that rises may hit struggling town centres hard and ' send out the wrong message ' to motorists			1
however , mr @entity3 refused to tell the committee what decision he is likely to make			2
the @entity73 supports councils who want to increase penalty charges			0
the association said in its 2013 parking masterplan that it wants fines to be reviewed at least every four years			0
it says on its website more frequent reviews are needed ' to ensure they remain effective and fit for purpose and that charges are set locally '			0
the association said : ' there is an urgent need to change these penalty charges since they often fail to act as a deter rent and sometimes encourage non-compliance with traffic management and parking rules			0
' this is costly and unfair on council tax payers who will be subsidising parking enforcement and undermines effectiveness of local transport policies			0

transport secretary @entity3 opened review into parking fine cap
outside the capital drivers pay up to £ 70 for a fine but in @entity12 cost if £ 130
mr @entity3 told @entity22 that charges should be looked as cost of parking so high in some places that fines no longer a ' deterrent '
