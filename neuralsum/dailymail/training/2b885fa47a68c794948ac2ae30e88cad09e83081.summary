shocking figures : four out of ten parents say their children have been exposed to internet porn more than four in ten parents say that their children have been exposed to internet porn , an official survey reveals			1
almost a third say their sons or daughters have received sexually explicit emails or texts and a quarter say they have been bullied online or on their phones			1
many others have been exposed to websites promoting anorexia , self - harm and even suicide			0
the frightening insight is contained in a round - up of responses to a @entity24 consultation on parental internet controls obtained by this paper			1
the @entity27 is campaigning for an automatic block on online porn to protect children , with over- 18s only able to access adult material if they ‘ opt in ’ following a strict age verification check			0
the consultation reveals that 57 per cent of the 757 parents who responded to the consultation were in favour of stricter controls , including 47 per cent who wanted an opt - in system			1
however , in total , just one in six of the 3,509 respondents – most of whom were not parents – supported the full opt - in solution			0
two - thirds of the respondents were from just one pressure group called the @entity49 , which is against default filters to block net porn			0
children ’s charities will be concerned that the consultation has been swamped by those opposed to stricter controls			1
@entity57 ’s media spokesman @entity56 , who wants to see an opt - in system , criticised the @entity24 for still not having published the results of the consultation two months after it ended			1
@entity62 says ' we need to see action from the government on children 's access to pornography ( stock image ) two meetings of the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) to discuss the consultation responses have been cancelled , leading to accusations that ministers are dragging their feet			0
‘ it is shocking that despite the findings of the consultation being known , and the urgency of this issue , the government has yet to respond to the consultation , ’ said miss @entity56			2
‘ in particular , the finding that 41 per cent of parents say their children have been exposed to pornography shows why the government should take urgent action			1
’ the consultation asked parents whether their children had been exposed to a range of online dangers			1
highest on the list is pornography , with 41 per cent of parents saying their offspring had seen it			2
the second - largest danger was sexually explicit messages , with 31 per cent of parents saying their children had received so - called ‘ sexts ’			1
some 27 per cent of parents said their children had been exposed to violence , 26 per cent to gambling and 23 per cent on bullying			1
another 22 per cent believe their children have been abused by text , while a similar proportion have been exposed to drink or drugs			2
other online dangers reported by parents include websites promoting self - harm ( 10 per cent ) , anorexia ( 9 per cent ) , suicide ( 8 per cent ) and radicalisation ( 8 per cent )			2
some 9 per cent of parents said that their children had been exposed to the risk of sexual grooming by men			2
the document concluded : ‘ children ’s online safety is the responsibility of parents or a shared responsibility between parents and businesses			0
‘ the majority of respondents were opposed to all of the three options for parental controls consulted on			0
‘ parents are concerned about potentially harmful content such as pornography and violence , and behavioural issues , such as sexting and bullying			0
‘ increasing the level of education and awareness among parents will make it easier for them to use parental controls , and limit exposure to risks online			0
’ the document advised @entity71 to support an industry - designed scheme under which customers choose the option that is ‘ right for their family and circumstances ’			0
‘ providers will take measures to check that the person setting up the parental controls is over the age of 18 , ’ it said .			0
