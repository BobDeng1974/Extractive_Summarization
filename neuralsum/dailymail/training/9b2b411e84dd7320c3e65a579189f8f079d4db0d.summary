by @entity0 published : 04:05 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 11:26 est , 10 april 2013 @entity1 will leave several children behind when he goes to jail friday for his part in the hair and beard - cutting scandal against other @entity7 @entity7 schoolchildren held their end - of - school celebration early yesterday so their parents could attend before they are jailed for beard - cutting			1
nine members of the @entity14 sect led by @entity15 are already in prison after being convicted of the hate crime against rival followers , and five more will join them this friday			1
four women and one man will start jail terms of between one and seven years , leaving nearly three dozen children without one or both parents for the duration of their sentences			1
they were convicted of cutting off the hair or beards of fellow @entity7 in a campaign of assaults said to have been orchestrated by the leader of the breakaway sect @entity32 the incidents are considered deeply offensive in @entity7 culture as the beard is considered a symbol of manhood and faith			1
usually the @entity7 settle disputes within their communities , but in this instance the police were involved because of the seriousness of the assaults , in which victims were said to have been pinned down , screaming , as their beards were hacked off by ' howling ' aggressors			2
yesterday 's end - of - school celebration was brought forward from its usual date at the end of april so that the convicted parents could spend some time with their children before going to jail			1
men played baseball in buttoned shirts , work boots and blue pants with suspenders			0
their wives , some barefoot , sat on simple wooden benches and chatted , their long - sleeved , blue and green dresses and white head scarves fluttering in the wind			2
their children relaxed nearby , dressed like smaller versions of their parents			2
' it 's a happy day on the outside , but not on the inside			0
on the inside , a lot of times we 're crying , but we have to keep our spirits up for the children 's sake , ' said @entity77 , whose husband , @entity78 , was accused of orchestrating the hair - cutting attacks and was sentenced to 15 years , the longest term of the 16 defendants in the case			1
glimpses from the news media are limited in @entity7 communities , but the members of @entity32 's group in @entity106 said they were open to sharing their story because they feel they 've been treated unfairly by the justice system			1
@entity7 , who shun many facets of modern life , are deeply religious and believe the @entity112 instructs women to let their hair grow long and men to grow beards and stop shaving once they marry , which means cutting the hair would be shameful and offensive			1
@entity120 , left , and @entity121 , right , will leave their small children in the care of others when they go to jail @entity1 , who will go to prison later this week , carries his son to the schoolhouse for the party @entity7 girls gathered outside the school house before the start of their final day of class yesterday @entity134 adjusts her traditional @entity7 bonnet as she surveys the farewell celebrations for those convicted of hate crimes the defendants do n't deny the hair - cuttings - some say they regret what happened , others do n't - but contend they stemmed from family disputes that should have been handled internally			1
they say that they are bound by different rules guided by their religion and that the government had no business getting involved in what they did			0
' we 're not exactly saying it was wrong , and we do n't say it 's right , either			0
... it 's something that will never happen again , i can tell you that , ' said @entity134 , a daughter of @entity157 who was not charged			0
a little girl enjoyed a ride on a miniature pony , left , while @entity1 crosses home plate at the party @entity7 women wait to hear their children sing during the final day of class yesterday @entity7 men sat apart from their womenfolk before the school celebration in @entity169 yesterday @entity7 girls enjoyed a picnic in the sunshine in @entity106 , @entity169 , as part of farewell celebrations for four women and one man from their sect all 16 defendants have appealed , arguing that the group 's conviction , sentencing and imprisonment in separate facilities as far away as @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 violates their constitutional rights and amounts to cruel and unusual punishment , an argument prosecutors reject			1
the defendants say the distance to the facilities is too great to travel by horse - drawn buggy or even by using a hired driver , so most of their families likely wo n't be able to visit			0
the five reporting to prison on friday said they 're scared and not sure what to expect , but they 're hopeful about being released early for good behavior			0
they 're sewing clothes , plowing ground and finishing other chores to make life easier for their loved ones who will remain in the community			0
two women were bracing for their first plane ride , to prisons in @entity185			0
@entity7 boys walk to the schoolhouse on their final day of class before saying goodbye to five members of their community a family of @entity7 walk to the school house in the sunshine yesterday where the children were to perform their departure will leave nearly three dozen children without at least one parent , and some without both because their fathers already are incarcerated , so the adults have made alternative arrangements			1
in some cases , older siblings will look after younger ones			0
the spouses and 15 children of two defendants , @entity120 and @entity1 , are merging under one roof while they serve their one - year sentences			2
@entity233 is beginning a similar sentence and giving @entity77 custody of her eight children until she returns because her husband is in @entity238 on a seven - year sentence			2
the case has shocked the @entity7 in @entity241 and shone a light on their strictly traditional ways @entity7 children from first through eighth grade sang songs in @entity248 and @entity249 for their parents @entity121 was convicted and sentenced to prison for her role in the hair and beard - cutting scandal before the trial , the @entity7 rejected plea agreements that offered leniency and could have helped some of the young mothers avoid prison			1
several said yesterday that they rejected those deals , either because they did n't want to admit guilt to a hate crime charge or they did n't want to testify against @entity32 and say things they do n't believe			2
the community members say they 're working together to ensure the group perseveres by handling home repairs and various chores that would have been the responsibility of the incarcerated members , with the remaining men especially bearing the burden of extra work			0
among them is the 19 - year - old grandson who took over running @entity157 's 700 - acre farm .			0
