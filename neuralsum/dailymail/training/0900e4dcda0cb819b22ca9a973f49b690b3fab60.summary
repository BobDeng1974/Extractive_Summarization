when @entity1 revealed last year that its 2015 @entity3 ad would be starring a nine - week - old puppy named @entity5 , viewers could never have anticipated the cruel twist it would take			1
the domain name company released the advert on tuesday - five days before it will be viewed by more than 100 million people during the @entity10 and @entity12 game - and it was met with outrage			1
the advert opens with the golden retriever puppy riding in the back of a truck , as it parodies @entity19 's commercials featuring a dog and its @entity22 horses			1
but instead of enjoying the view , @entity5 is thrown from the bed of the truck and he faces a treacherous journey home across train tracks and bridges and through mud and rain			2
do n't be fooled : @entity1 's @entity33 advert , which was revealed on tuesday , opens with @entity5 the puppy looking out from the bed of a truck - but it soon takes a dark turn plot twist : the truck hits a rock and the golden retriever puppy is thrown from the back of the truck finally , he sees his owners ' farm and runs towards them , as they open their arms in joy			1
but it 's no happy ending : the only reason they 're glad to seem him is because they 've sold him on a website they set up with the help of @entity1			1
the pup is promptly put in a van and driven away by @entity1 spokesperson @entity55			2

on track : @entity5 , who was nine - weeks - old when they shot the commercial , tries to find his way home treacherous : in other scenes , he cowers in the cold as he tries to get back to his family 's farm ' poking fun at a puppy mill is not a laughing matter , ' wrote @entity85			1
' and i hope they get bombarded with calls and emails letting them know how disgusting the commercial is			0
' ' what kind of monster do they have running their marketing department ? # @entity91 , horrid , shameful , ' @entity95 tweeted			0

reunited : but when @entity5 finally makes his way back home , his owners have some unexpected news @entity113 , @entity5 ! the pup has been sold via a website they set up with the help of @entity1 heartbreaking : @entity5 is driven away by @entity1 spokesperson @entity55 to his new home in 2013 , the company 's advert featured model @entity121 kissing a geeky actor , to show how the domain - name registrar mixes smart and sexy			1
ahead of this year 's reveal , @entity125 of @entity126 9000 , the advertising company behind the ad , had told @entity129 they would be ' playing with @entity3 clich√©s '			1

' but he warned : ' it 's not going to be sappy			0
' anger : viewers took to @entity104 to complain about the advert			2
the company said it was parodying other @entity3 adverts featuring puppies - but viewers said there was nothing funny about puppy mills annoyed : @entity146 , a pet trainer and host , also vented her anger on @entity104 on tuesday			1

@entity1 released its 2015 @entity3 advert on tuesday
the commercial features a golden retriever puppy who makes his way home after being thrown from a truck - only to find out he 's being sold
his owners used @entity1 to make a website to sell him
the company said it was parodying other puppy @entity3 adverts
but viewers were outraged and *slammed* the company for making light of puppy mills and *irresponsible* dog *breeding*
