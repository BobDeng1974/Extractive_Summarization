unless they are building roads all day or running a multi-national corporation , i expect they have just lost sight of priorities			0
if you wish to stay connected and happy in your marriage , my advice to you is to never be too tired or too busy to feel love for your partner			1
when your life is nearly over , you will regret it if you look back and recall too many nights when you made excuses instead of making love			1
always greet your partner ' if you want your relationship to survive and to thrive , you will have to train yourself to focus most of your attention on the person you love			1
when your sweetheart comes into the room , whether it 's just from taking care of some chores in the garage or from a long day at work , your job is to put down whatever you 're doing , look him in the eye , and verbally express your delight at seeing him again			0
it 's really so little to ask , and delivers so much - to both of you			1
keep the romance alive , even when you have children ' it 's true that when your babies are small , there is n't much time left over for romantic gestures			0
but the wonderful thing about romance is that it is the quality , never the quantity , that matters			0
so when the baby is napping , throw a blanket on the living room floor , slice some peaches or plums or whatever you have in the house , pour a glass of something bubbly , and enjoy a mini picnic			0
write love notes to each other and slip them in between the clean diapers			0
be creative , and if you want your love to flourish , it certainly will do so			0
be honest about money problems ' the most important ingredient for getting through tough economic times is the truth - it 's so important it should be capitalized and italicized			1
so this means that if you have any financial secrets you are keeping from your partner , you must put them on the table			1
does n't that sound scary ? i am sure it does , but as with so many unpleasant things that only get bigger and stronger in the dark , these secrets have a funny way of shrinking in the light of the truth			0
and as they get smaller , your stress and worry will fly away			0
there 's never a better time to be honest with your partner and yourself and make a plan for dealing with your debts and your excess spending - together			1
i promise , you will not regret it			0
control your anger ' have you ever noticed that you ca n't spell dangerous without anger ? i 'm no linguist , but i do n't think that 's a coincidence			0
when you 're ready to blow , you might say anything hurtful , things you would normally spare the person you love from hearing			0
do n't say something you 'll regret forever			0
do n't give your partner an excuse to come back to you with his or her own resentments			1
instead , find a way to get your anger under control			0
for myself , i simply run through my mind a short movie of how foolishly i have been acting			0
you may have better luck singing a silly song , or patting your head while rubbing your tummy , or doing whatever little trick helps bring you outside of yourself long enough to regain control			0
