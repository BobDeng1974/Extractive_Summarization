by @entity0 @entity1 are looking for another striker despite the arrival of @entity4 on loan from @entity6			1
manager @entity7 remains keen to sign @entity9 's @entity8 but a deal for @entity12 's @entity11 is unlikely			1
@entity1 also want a centre - back and a younger goalkeeper			1
on the lookout : @entity1 have bagged the signing of @entity4 but want more strikers @entity7 said : ' @entity22 is a good presence on the pitch , a big guy at 6ft 2in , a player who has gone to the @entity20 and has been okay , if we manage to secure him , he would be a player who we 'd expect to do a lot better here			1
' on @entity11 , @entity7 added : ' i think he ’s had plenty of chances to come to us			1
' we made it very clear that we would like to have him and it has n’t really happened and therefore sometimes you have to say where ’s the line drawn for us as a club as we have our own respect and our own professionalism			0
' @entity4 is due to join for an initial loan fee of £ 1.6m but the deal could be become permanent for £ 6.4m			1
on the hunt : @entity43 boss @entity7 is also on the lookout for a centre - half and a young goalkeeper @entity1 moved ahead of interest from the likes of @entity49 to thrash out a deal for the 23 - year - old before setting off for their pre-season games against @entity53 and @entity54 in @entity55			1
a permanent deal could follow which would cost @entity1 £ 6.4million			2
@entity4 scored six goals in just eight appearances but refused to play for @entity6 because of the political unrest in @entity20			2
he apologised for not playing and said : ' first and foremost , i want to apologise to them ( the fans ) and the president of our club			0
i hope what is happening in @entity67 will soon end			0
my family was very worried about me and persuaded not to go to @entity20			0
' they thought it was very dangerous			0
so i decided not to go back			2
but on the second day i regretted it			0
my fears were dispelled by a conversation with the club ceo @entity74			0
he calmed me down and assured that all of us would be safe			0

@entity4 joins @entity1 on loan from @entity6
@entity7 remains keen to sign @entity8
a deal for @entity12 striker @entity11 seems unlikely though
@entity1 also want to sign a centre - back and goalkeeper
