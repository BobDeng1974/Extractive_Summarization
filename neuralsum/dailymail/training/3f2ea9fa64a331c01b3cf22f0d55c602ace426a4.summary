the @entity1 fans sang @entity3 ’s name loudly as he was substituted in the 84th minute , once victory over @entity5 was all but assured			1
‘ he scores when he wants , ’ they chanted in acknowledgement of the striker heading in his 14th goal in 23 appearances			1
he shook hands with manager @entity12 and warmly embraced his replacement , @entity14 , the £ 26million signing who was once backed to fill the gaping chasm left by @entity19 ’s departure but who has failed to live up to that billing			2
@entity3 scored his fourteenth goal in 23 appearances when @entity1 met @entity5 on saturday front man @entity3 said that he is setting his sights on scoring 20 goals for his club this season the 21 - year - old striker is mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates following his goal at @entity29 @entity3 's deadliness in front of goal manager means he is becoming invaluable for boss @entity12 instead it is the 21 - year - old from @entity34 , a product of the academy system , who looks most likely to make up the goal deficit left in the @entity40 ’s wake			1
his confidence is soaring after scoring in each of his last three games and @entity3 believes he can be the 20 - goal - a - season man @entity1 have been searching for			1
@entity5 again named an entirely @entity46 - born starting xi for saturday ’s @entity48 game at @entity1			1
the last team to do so in the @entity48 were @entity50 against @entity51 on the final day of the 2010 - 11 season			2
‘ my first target was 10 goals and i reached that , ’ said @entity3 , ‘ my next target is 20 goals , so six to go			2
’ while @entity14 admitted to being ashamed hearing @entity1 fans sing his name even as he failed to justify his hefty price tag , boyhood @entity1 fan @entity3 was delighted , recalling cheering his own heroes			1
‘ it ’s great to hear them sing my name , like when i came off the pitch today , ’ he said			0
‘ i used to sing the name of @entity68 , he was a big idol of mine , and @entity70			0
‘ it can only spur you on			0
you can only do your best for the fans			0
if they are singing your name it always feels good			0
’ @entity76 scored with a sublime strike to give @entity1 the lead for the second time against @entity5 with @entity14 misfiring , however , @entity1 have stepped up their interest in @entity83 ’s £ 25m - rated striker @entity82 after shelving a move for @entity85			1
the @entity87 striker remains a target for @entity12 , but the delay in his return from a knee injury has forced @entity1 into reassessing their january plans			1
it was current top man @entity3 , though , who put @entity1 in front in the 21st minute on saturday with a header from a @entity97 cross			1
his effort was cancelled out on 27 minutes by @entity100 ’s stunning strike , which sailed into the roof of the net			0
@entity76 executed a similarly spectacular strike eight minutes later , which eventually sealed all three points for the home side			0
it stoked the fires for @entity1 on the back of a win over @entity110 last week and a 4 - 0 @entity112 thrashing of @entity113			2
@entity14 has failed to impress for the north @entity115 side since joining the club last august @entity100 ( centre ) pulled @entity5 level against @entity1 with a brilliant strike from range @entity3 claims his rise shows that young @entity123 talent can prevail even in the mega-rich @entity48 with all its foreign imports			1
‘ sometimes young @entity123 players who come through the ranks do n’t always get the chance at the top level , ’ he said			0
‘ i have been fortunate enough to get a chance and i ’ve been able to take it			0
so it proves you do n’t always have to buy players			0
’ @entity12 seems to have found a settled starting 11 who he claims have bought into his philosophy of pressing football			2
it has been said that players need two hearts to play for the @entity138 , such is the work ethic he demands			0
@entity3 added : ‘ @entity140 is normally a time where teams get tired but you can see we ’re really stepping it up			2

against @entity5 @entity3 scored his 14th goal in 23 @entity1 appearances
the @entity1 striker is a firm *favourite* with fans at @entity29
the 21 - year - old is becoming @entity12 's *preferred* front man
