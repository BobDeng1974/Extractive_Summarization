her best friend , not wishing to live without her fifth - grade classmate , vowed they should die together			2
fateful fiction : the girls were apparently inspired to commit suicide because of a desire to travel back in time			1
some believe they were influenced by time travel tv time travel tv shows like this , have been blamed for inspiring young @entity2 children to commit suicide in the hope of visiting ' the past ' they each wrote suicide notes and hid them in a cupboard before jumping into a pond to drown themselves			1
