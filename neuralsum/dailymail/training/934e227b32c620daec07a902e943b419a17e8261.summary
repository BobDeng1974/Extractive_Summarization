by @entity0 published : 08:43 est , 16 august 2012 updated : 19:39 est , 16 august 2012 @entity1 has reacted with fury after internet trolls joked about the death of his beloved dog			1
the @entity7 presenter declared : ‘ @entity8 is a nation of 62million complete and utter b * * * * * ds. ’ father - of - three @entity1 , 52 , placed the news on @entity11 after one of the family pets , a labrador named @entity15 , had to be put down at the age of 15			1
if he expected to receive sympathy from his 503,861 followers , however , he was sorely disappointed			1
grieving : @entity1 named and shamed people who sent him vile messages when he revealed that his beloved dog @entity15 , right , a black @entity22 , had died last month he wrote in this month ’s @entity7 magazine : ‘ a few moments ago my dog died , and , as an experiment , i announced the fact on @entity11			1
now , everyone must have known that when a family pet is put down , the family in question is bound to be upset			1
so you ’d expect a bit of sympathy			2
and , in @entity35 , that ’s what you ’d get			2
not in @entity8 , though			2
‘ moments after i posted my @entity11 , a man called @entity46 asked , “ how does she smell ? ” @entity37 said the news was “ kinda funny ”			1
@entity39 wanted to know if it was @entity41 ’s fault , and @entity42 said simply : “ @entity43 ”			2
all that in less than what @entity11 calls zero seconds			1
‘ five minutes has now elapsed , and still it ’s a non-stop tirade of abuse			2
@entity8 is a nation of 62million complete and utter b * * * * * ds. ’ @entity1 and his beloved family pet @entity15 and his wife pictured at home in 1998			2
the dog died in july online : @entity1 did have some sympathetic responses to his news , above , but has named and shamed the @entity11 ' abusers '			1

they have three other dogs , including a labradoodle , at their home in @entity77 , @entity78			1
a source said : ‘ @entity1 , his wife @entity80 and the kids are all upset			0

he said : ‘ if i say something that offends you , either here or on the television , you know where i am			0
you can shove a pie into my face or throw manure over my garden wall			0
but the person who ignores @entity128 ’s remarkable achievements in the pool and concentrates only on her nose ? she has no idea who they are or where they live			0
’ while the reaction 's to @entity1 's tweets do n't necessarily go as far as trolling , people who dish out abuse online have come increasingly under the spotlight lately			1
most recently @entity156 singer @entity155 was subjected to taunts from trolls just days after him and his wife @entity159 announced that their baby daughter was delivered stillborn			0
