by @entity0 published : 18:15 est , 1 march 2013 updated : 05:09 est , 2 march 2013 the @entity1 snatched a victory from the jaws of defeat yesterday after their most torrid week since coming to power			2
but @entity6 had to rely on @entity8 voters to do it after polling suggested he had benefited from tactical switching to try to stop the @entity12 winning			1
he hailed it a ‘ stunning victory ’ , although the @entity1 saw their majority cut in half			0
it came as the seat ’s disgraced former mp @entity18 faces jail , former @entity1 chief executive @entity21 is accused of molesting women and the party ’s poll ratings nationally are their at lowest in years			0
scraped through : @entity25 , pictured with his wife @entity26 at the @entity28 count , won his seat by just 1,771 votes but analysis of the @entity28 poll showed @entity1 relied heavily on a lacklustre campaign by @entity8			1
twenty - three per cent of those who voted @entity8 at the last general election – around 1,800 voters – instead backed the @entity1 , according to exit polling by @entity38			2
tactical voting was not encouraged by @entity8 , unlike in 2010 when senior figures hinted that people in marginal southern seats should vote @entity1 where @entity8 had little chance but the @entity1 candidate , tax specialist @entity25 , clearly found @entity8 voters ’ support crucial as he scraped through only 1,771 votes ahead of @entity46			1
@entity46 leader @entity47 and @entity28 candidate @entity48 celebrates the party 's second place finish in the by - election all smiles : @entity46 leader @entity47 emerged as one of the big winners of the night , claiming the result had ' stunned the establishment ' @entity1 president @entity58 admitted that defeat by any margin would have been an ‘ unspeakable catastrophe ’ and would have fuelled critics who said the party was ‘ going down the plughole ’			1
he took the opportunity to attack claims that @entity21 made unwanted advances to a number of female activists as a ploy by the @entity71 to derail the party ’s chances			0
mr @entity6 said it showed his party was still able to win elections , even in ‘ exceptionally difficult circumstances ’			0
mr @entity25 said he was ‘ absolutely exuberant ’			0
mr @entity58 said that up to 30 @entity12 seats were now vulnerable in the 2015 general election			0
@entity80 faces : @entity81 admitted the defeat of @entity12 candidate @entity83 , pictured at an event during the campaign , was ' disappointing ' against the odds : mr @entity25 's triumph came despite the resignation of ex-cabinet minister @entity18 , who faces jail for perverting the course of justice , and the @entity1 being caught up in sexual harassment claims against @entity21			1

polls suggest @entity1 benefited from tactical voting to stop @entity12 winning
@entity1 candidate @entity25 won his seat by 1,771 votes ahead of @entity46
around *23* *%* of @entity8 's previous voters *decided* to back the @entity1
