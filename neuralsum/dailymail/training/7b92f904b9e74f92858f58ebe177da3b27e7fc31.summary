by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:59 est , 23 april 2013 @entity3 : 07:02 est , 24 april 2013 @entity4 last night dismissed criticism that his inquiry into press standards had been undermined by revelations of an affair between two key lawyers			1
he insisted there was ‘ simply no room ’ for a ‘ breach of confidence or other conspiracy ’ as a result of the relationship between @entity14 , a member of his legal team , and celebrities ’ barrister @entity19			1
but the high court judge declined to answer a series of crucial questions about the relationship , which was revealed by the @entity28 and has raised concerns over whether it undermined the integrity of his inquiry			0
affair : @entity36 ' barrister mr @entity19 and mrs @entity37 , a member of @entity4 ’s legal team , claim their relationship did not start until after the inquiry twice - married mr @entity19 , 44 , and miss @entity37 , 40 , admit going on holiday together to @entity42 in august – days after months of public hearings at the inquiry ended – but claim their affair did not begin until after the @entity4 report was published in november			1
the couple did not tell @entity4 or his senior counsel , @entity48 , about the affair			1
the judge only learnt of their trip to the @entity54 island – during which they say they discussed ‘ the possibility of a future relationship ’ – when the @entity28 asked him to comment on it			0
@entity61 have demanded that @entity4 launch a full investigation , and a series of questions about who knew what and when remain to be answered			2
last night @entity68 mp @entity67 said : ‘ @entity4 gives the impression of dismissing this out of hand			1
i would have thought in the interests of transparency that this would have deserved a more considered and substantive response			0
’ @entity14 : questioned more than 50 witnesses the @entity28 put these questions to @entity4 and his senior counsel at the inquiry , @entity48			2
the affair mr @entity83 says he first learnt of a ‘ personal relationship of any sort ’ between @entity19 and @entity14 on march 18 , 2013 , and later informed @entity4			1
but their relationship has apparently been the talk of fellow lawyers for a year and the couple were regularly seen having coffee in the @entity93 brasserie , close to the @entity94 where they sat on opposite sides of the inquiry			0
1 : how did mr @entity83 learn of the relationship ? 2 : was he aware of legal gossip surrounding the couple circulating for up to a year ? 3 : what was he told of the affair and when did he inform @entity4 ? 4 : why did mr @entity83 decide he should inform @entity4 that mr @entity19 and miss @entity37 @entity37 were in a relationship when he learned about it ? was it because he recognised it might give rise to a concern that the proper conduct of the inquiry may have been affected ? the @entity54 holiday both @entity4 and mr @entity83 say they only learnt of the @entity42 holiday last week			1
but the couple flew to the @entity54 island in august , a few days after the public hearings at the inquiry finished and three months before the publication of the @entity4 report			2
5 : how and on what date did they discover the couple had travelled to the @entity54 island ? 6 : do they think that they should have been consulted by miss @entity37 about any planned trip to @entity42 ? if they had been , what would have been their position ? 7 : have mr @entity19 or miss @entity37 been asked to make sworn statements about their relationship and the trip to @entity42 ? the ‘ @entity133 ’ @entity4 said at the weekend : ‘ there is no suggestion in the facts as we understand them to be that ms @entity37 ’s work for the inquiry was in any way affected by her developing relationship with mr @entity19			1
’ the judge says miss @entity37 ’s role after the public hearings – where she became known on social media as ‘ woman on the left ’ – ended in july was merely collating facts and proof reading			0
but during the public hearings she questioned more than 50 witnesses , including seven of mr @entity19 ’s clients			2
her role was to be scrupulously independent			0
8 : have @entity4 or mr @entity83 spoken directly to mr @entity19 or miss @entity14 about their relationship ? 9 : what steps have been taken to ensure miss @entity37 ’s collation of facts was not tainted by her relationship with mr @entity19 ? 10 : given that interested parties ’ questions for witnesses could only be put via the inquiry legal team , are @entity4 and mr @entity83 content that miss @entity37 carried out her role entirely impartially ? best behaviour this was one of the most high - profile public inquiries			1
senior legal sources with experience of @entity4 - style proceedings say they would have warned their legal teams to be careful			2
11 : at the start of the inquiry , did @entity4 or mr @entity83 issue any guidance to the inquiry ’s legal team about behaviour during the proceedings ? @entity182 questions have been raised about the perception of the impartiality of the inquiry as a result of the disclosure of the relationship between mr @entity19 and miss @entity14			1
12 : what comment do @entity4 and mr @entity83 have on this ? @entity192 , parliamentary aide to @entity193 , the health secretary , wrote to the judge at the weekend urging him to examine the implications of the relationship			1
he said : ‘ in the interests of transparency and in maintaining public confidence in the complete integrity and impartiality of your inquiry , i strongly urge you to make inquiries and to get to the bottom of this matter without delay			0
’ the @entity68 mp has also asked the @entity211 to consider whether the two barristers have breached the @entity213			2
in his reply to mr @entity192 yesterday , @entity4 said he would not comment on ‘ what , if any ’ action the @entity211 decides to take			1
holiday together : the pair went on a break to the island of @entity42 ( pictured ) in @entity54 not informed : @entity4 was not told about the affair and only learned about the couple 's holidaying together in the past week ‘ as for the integrity and impartiality of the inquiry , i know exactly what work i asked ms @entity37 to do after august 3 ( by which time the hearings had concluded ) and i have reminded myself of the dates and precise work she did , in fact , undertake in the months that followed and the material to which she had access , ’ he said			1
@entity210 letter : @entity192 wants @entity211 to examine whether there may have been a breach of the code of conduct ‘ i need to make no further inquiry : she did exactly what i had requested			1
she had absolutely no input into any conclusion as to the past treatment of those affected by press abuses ( or indeed the relationship between the @entity248 and the public as considered by @entity250 of the inquiry ) or any aspect of the proposals made for future press regulation			0
she was simply not involved in any of this work			0
’ the judge , in his third statement in five days about the affair , said miss @entity14 ’s involvement after august 3 was ‘ confined to the collation of facts ’ concerning the historical relationship between the @entity248 and politicians			0
‘ in that period , save for some proof reading in the final few days before publication , she did not see and was not involved in any discussions about the other sections of the report or , indeed , in any of my eventual recommendations , ’ he said			0
‘ there was simply no room for a ‘ ‘ breach of confidence or other conspiracy ’ ’ as a result of personal relations between her and mr @entity19			2
’ mr @entity192 was disappointed with @entity4 ’s response			1
he said : ‘ @entity4 seems to have accepted that the two barristers went on holiday “ to discuss the possibility of a relationship ” at face value			0
it is rather surprising that he seems unwilling to investigate whether anything was going on before this time			0
’ mr @entity19 , a father of three , represented @entity286 and other phone - hacking victims at the inquiry whose public hearings ran from september 2011 to july 2012			2
miss @entity37 , dubbed the ‘ thinking man ’s @entity291 ’ , was required to be totally independent when testing evidence given to the inquiry on behalf of the public			0
she questioned witnesses , including mr @entity19 ’s clients , with grievances against the @entity248 , and trended on @entity299 as # womanontheleft after being spotted by viewers who suggested she was making eyes at mr @entity286			0
she is understood to be divorcing her 45 - year - old husband , qc @entity303 .			0
