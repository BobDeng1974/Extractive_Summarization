he writes : ' @entity5 is a leader that @entity84 and @entity4 members did n't want			1
he was forced upon them by the @entity128 and like most people , i was n't happy with the result			0
' i tried for as long as i could to give @entity5 the benefit of the doubt			0
but look what it 's come to , with the party and the leader now a national laughing stock			2
' rarely in @entity98 history has a leader become so quickly defined by humiliating questions about his looks and personality			0
on his new allegiance to the @entity101 's , mr @entity23 said : ' @entity34 , sensing the intellectual and political paralysis throughout the @entity49 , has picked up @entity4 's baton of reform and is running with it			1
' @entity34 's conservatives have again become the party of the aspirational classes			2
' he concludes : ' but the @entity49 - which has comfortably turned back into @entity153 - no longer speaks for this country			0
