refugee @entity0 has nine children to feed but he ca n't focus on the future because the sounds of women and children crying out for help while being buried alive by @entity8 militants in northern @entity9 often consume his mind			1
tens of thousand of @entity12 fled their ancient homeland of @entity14 and other villages to escape a dramatic push by the @entity18 militants who regard the ethnic minority as devil worshippers who must embrace their radical version of @entity22 or die			1
the refugees sit idle in camps in the semi-autonomous @entity26 region in northern @entity9			1
@entity50 air strikes against islamic state positions and vows by @entity26 commanders to recapture @entity12 villages provided no reassurances			1
it 's easy to see why			2
ten days ago , @entity0 and his fellow villagers were suddenly surrounded by @entity8 militants with machine guns at night			0
some had face masks and @entity63 writing on the sides of their heads			0
absent from the scene were @entity26 peshmerga , or ' those who confront death ' , fighters who had held parts of the north and were seen as the only force that could stand up to @entity8 after thousands of @entity50 - trained @entity9 soldiers fled their advance , leaving them with heavy weapons including tanks suddenly the men began digging ditches - soon to become mass graves			1
' we did not understand			0
then they started to put people in those holes , those people were alive , ' said former grocery shop owner @entity0 , 46 , pausing to weep			2
the @entity12 in the north of the country have suffered badly at the hands of the vicious @entity8 forces refugee @entity9 smile as they carry new clothes provided to them by a charity organisation ' after a while we heard gunfire			1
i ca n't forget that scene			0
women , children , crying for help			2
we had to run for our lives , there was nothing to be done for them			0
' it was not possible to independently verify these accounts			0
some of the @entity12 escaped with the help of @entity109 and @entity110 @entity26 fighters			1
but similar scenes are reported in several parts of the north			0
in some of the most recent bloodshed , militants massacred at least 80 @entity12 men in @entity119 village because they refused to convert to @entity22 , @entity9 officials said			1
women and children were abducted			2
reports from northern @entity9 describe @entity123 forces beheading people and in some instances burying them alive @entity8 seemed most intent on killing members of @entity9 's majority @entity128 sect , which it considers to be heretical			1
during @entity8 's latest offensive in the north , minority @entity12 and @entity131 have suffered the most			1
the @entity12 , followers of an ancient religion derived from @entity136 , are spread over northern @entity9 and are part of the country 's @entity26 minority			1
many of their villages were destroyed when @entity143 's troops tried to crush the @entity26			1
some were taken away by the executed former dictator 's intelligence agents			2
now they feel helpless again			0
@entity9 has a new prime minister who is seen as moderate and may be less inclined to engage in disputes with the @entity26 over budgets and oil than his predecessor , perhaps bringing political stability that could benefit the north			1
a new camp outside the @entity158 camp in @entity32 town , @entity9 a @entity26 peshmerga fighter flashes the v for @entity163 sign as his group head to the front line near @entity166 but many @entity12 have lost faith in @entity9 and its leaders			1
some complained that @entity26 forces would not let them travel to @entity109			2
so for now , it seems all they can do is wait , and try to forget what caused them to flee their homes			0
' they put women and children under the ground			2
i still hear their screams			0
they were trying to keep their heads up to keep breathing , ' said car repairman @entity187 , 26			0
' @entity9 is finished for me			2
we had houses , shops , they all burnt our things			0
we want to cross to @entity109 but the peshmerga is not letting us			0
we will not stay there , we want to go to @entity197			0
' it is not clear if @entity9 government forces or peshmerga will manage to claw back territory and then hold it - something that could help @entity12 believe in their country again			1
the peshmerga fighters are some of the only people able to help defend the @entity12 from @entity123 persecution @entity8 is getting more ambitious			1
it has already grabbed much of the north and resources such as oil fields that will help fund its self - proclaimed caliphate			0
some @entity12 , like @entity187 , 22 , a student , shake their heads in disbelief when recalling how only foreign @entity26 fighters from @entity109 or @entity110 extended a lifeline in the face of @entity8			1
' they tied the hands of one woman to the back of a car and her legs to another car and they split her into two , ' he said beside makeshift tents as women cried			0
' have you seen anything like this ? this is all because she is not @entity230 and did not want to be converted			0
' @entity234 forces , aided by @entity50 military strikes , have recaptured the strategic @entity236			0
