by @entity0 last updated at 1:59 pm on 17th september 2011 no police officer will face disciplinary action over the death of @entity4 who killed herself and her disabled daughter after a decade of unchecked abuse by yobs			1
yesterday four officers accused of failing to stop the misery inflicted upon the family – who made dozens of 999 calls – were cleared of misconduct			1
the inspector , a sergeant and two constables were said in a report by the police watchdog to have ‘ cases to answer ’			1
tragic : @entity4 ( left ) and her daughter @entity21 , 18 , died after a decade of taunting			1
police officers will not face disciplinary action over their deaths but @entity25 said internal hearings this week had concluded that the case against the unnamed four was ‘ not proven ’			0
it means no individual officer has faced any disciplinary sanction over the case			0
a spokesman for the force blamed ‘ systems and processes ’ for the failure to respond to the family ’s desperate pleas for help			2
at the time miss @entity4 was accused of ‘ over-reacting ’ to the torment inflicted upon her by a gang of youths at their home in @entity43 , @entity44			1
in october 2007 she killed herself and her 18 - year - old daughter @entity45 , who had a mental age of four , by setting fire to their car in a layby			2
the yobs , some as young as ten , threw stones and eggs at their home , urinated on their wall , invaded the garden and pushed fireworks through the letter box , leaving the family ‘ under siege ’			1
an @entity62 report found that @entity63 , 38 , contacted the force on 33 occasions			1
yesterday the family ’s solicitor , @entity66 , said the family felt ‘ let down ’ by the force and added : ‘ numerous police failings were identified at the inquest and in the @entity62 report			1
‘ it is therefore hard for the @entity4 family to understand why no officer has been found guilty of misconduct			2
‘ police very rarely discipline officers for misconduct and criminal charges are virtually never brought			0
i invite the investigating officer to release to the family his rationale in reaching this decision			2
’ the bodies of @entity4 , 38 , and her daughter @entity84 , 18 , were discovered in a burnt out car the pair had suffered more than ten years of abuse at the hands of local youths in their @entity44 the force ’s deputy chief constable , @entity90 , said the misconduct hearings concluded that the mistakes made in the case were ‘ of an organisational nature due to the systems and processes in place at the time not enabling officers to provide the most effective service ’			0
he added : ‘ the tragic deaths of @entity4 and her daughter acted as a turning point for the force in how it prioritised and dealt with anti-social behaviour , linking incidents and identifying vulnerability			0
’ the inquest into the deaths heavily criticised both the force and the local council			0
it heard that none of the 16 - strong gang was ever prosecuted			0
at one point one yob told miss @entity4 : ‘ we can do anything we like to you and you ca n’t do anything about it			0
’ @entity122 , of the charity @entity123 , said it was ‘ extremely shocking and disappointing ’ that no one has been held accountable for the failure to protect @entity63 and @entity45			0
he said the deaths represented ‘ a complete failure in the police ’s ability to respond adequately to disability hate crime victims ’			0
and he called on the @entity62 to reopen the case to assess whether sufficient changes to policies and practices have been made to prevent similar failures .			1

youths had taunted the family for a decade , *pelting* their home with stones and *threatening* them
@entity62 *'s* *180* - page report said the incidents should have been treated as ' hate ' crimes
