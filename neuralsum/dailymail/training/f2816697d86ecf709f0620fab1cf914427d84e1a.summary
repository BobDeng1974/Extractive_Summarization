by @entity0 published : 12:16 est , 7 april 2013 updated : 13:12 est , 7 april 2013 a sat - nav blunder left a 44 - tonne truck stuck on a bus tramway after the driver faithfully followed the machine 's instructions , despite the warning signage			1
the £ 100millon track built to take buses into @entity10 speedily confused the lorry driver who was unfamiliar with the area			1
but a local council spokesman insisted he was ' quite puzzled how the driver managed it			2
' warning signs : a lorry driver carried on through all signage to end up on a concrete track which whisks buses into @entity10 reprimanded : the driver had been relying too heavily on his sat - nav dog walker @entity23 , of @entity24 , @entity22 was waiting to catch the guided @entity25 into @entity10 with his wife @entity26 when he snapped the pictures of the errant lorry			1
mr @entity23 said : ' we saw a red vehicle turn onto the busway , and thought it was a bus , but were amazed to see it was a big lorry '			0
' it managed to turn off into the main car park i think , and get off that way			0
' @entity38 , boss of haulage firm @entity38 's which operates the bus from @entity42 , @entity43 , said his driver had ' relied too heavily on his sat - nav ' and had been reprimanded			2
he apologised to the council , but said the driver told him his navigation system did not give any warning about the concrete tracks			2
he said : ' we do n't usually deliver around the @entity24 area , or @entity22 , so it was n't something the driver had ever come across before			0
' future fine : the council warned that if the mistake happened again the haulage company could face a penalty of up to £ 1,000 unfamiliar territory : the lorry driver from @entity43 got confused in @entity10 's unusual road system ' however , i do think some people rely too heavily on sat - navs instead of reading the road signs			1
' @entity66 , director of strategy and development at the council , said : ' there are clear and prominent signs on all the entry points			0
' ' to be honest , we do struggle to understand how this driver , in broad daylight , managed to get on to the busway			0
' the council warned mr @entity38 that the company could be fined up to £ 1,000 if it happened again			1
however , the busway has had its fair share of criticism itself			0
@entity22 was awarded £ 92.5 million from @entity82 to build @entity25			2
however , more than 50 emergencies have been reported on the track in the six months running up to january – 20 of them caused by motorists driving on to the track			1
an average of nine incidents has been logged on the guideway every month , according to @entity91 .			0

@entity93 said it was ' puzzled ' as to how driver got on to the tramway
company could be fined up to £ 1,000 if it happens again
however , vehicles *regularly* end up on the track by mistake
20 emergencies in six months from drivers getting on to @entity25
