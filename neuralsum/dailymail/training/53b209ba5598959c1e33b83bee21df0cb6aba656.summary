by @entity0 published : 17:43 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 01:55 est , 25 june 2013 @entity1 was accused of treating customers as ‘ cash cows ’ yesterday over controversial plans to sell their personal data			1
some 13.2million current and savings account holders will be affected by the move , buried in the small print of a letter sent to them last week			0
it insists customers must agree to let @entity1 share information about their transactions – the only way to opt out is to close their accounts			1
intrusion : @entity1 has controversial plans to turn its customers into ' cash cows ' by selling their data @entity1 ’ letter said changes to its terms were being brought in from october to make them ‘ clearer ’ , ‘ simpler ’ , and ‘ easier ’			1
but it admitted it will trawl accounts for information which it could then sell to other firms , government departments or mps			2
in a further intrusion , @entity1 will also use ‘ location data derived from any mobile device details you have given us ’			2
many customers are likely to have thrown the letter in the bin without realising that it says : ‘ we can combine information about you with information about other @entity1 customers to create reports which we may share with companies outside @entity1			1
’ monitoring : @entity1 will not allow its customers to be identified to third parties , but it will look through accounts for spending trends and other habits it adds that it ‘ can use information about the transactions on your account to increase our understanding of services and products that you may wish to use ’ , although customers can opt out of this part of the changes			1
the banking giant insists the information will not allow any customer to be identified but will look for spending trends and other habits			1
@entity1 will also monitor a customer ’s mobile phone to find out which country they are in – without their knowledge			2
the bank says this will prevent fraud , allowing them to find out whether a cash withdrawal in a foreign country is bogus , and the account holder ’s exact location will not be identified			0
bad year for @entity1 : chief executive @entity81 had to quit with immediate effect following a market - rigging scandal @entity1 insists its customers could benefit from their plans , as it could , for example , contact them to point out the amount they spend on their energy bill is much higher than other people in their postcode			1
@entity92 , director of privacy campaign group @entity93 , said : ‘ this is yet more evidence of an arms race between big companies who are intent on selling out their customers ’ privacy for their own profit			0
‘ @entity1 is following in the footsteps of a host of companies who no longer see their customers as people to provide a service to but instead a cash cow for personal data , to be monitored and sold on to advertisers with little regard for asking people ’s permission			1
’ @entity1 said : ‘ we only use information in a numerical , anonymised and aggregated way as is standard practice at many companies			2
it is not about providing information for sales or marketing use and does not include any personal data			0
‘ personal data will never be passed on to anybody else without their explicit consent			0
’ rival @entity127 insisted yesterday that it does not use customers ’ information in this way			0
sources at @entity132 said it does not sell its data and @entity135 also denied the practice			0
the controversy comes after a humiliating year for @entity1			0
