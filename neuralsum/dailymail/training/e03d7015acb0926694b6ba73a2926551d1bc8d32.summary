by @entity0 published : 23:41 est , 18 september 2012 updated : 23:52 est , 18 september 2012 missing : @entity1 disappeared from a @entity3 motel in 2005 and has never been seen again convicted child murderer @entity4 hid a dark family secret while awaiting trial for the abduction and killing of seven year old @entity4			1
@entity10 , 72 , was convicted last week of murdering the child in 1957 , as prosecutors successfully wrapped up one of the oldest child abduction cases in @entity16 history			1
but the @entity17 can exclusively reveal @entity10 's own daughter is missing -- and it 's not known if she 's dead or alive			1
in a bizarre twist that sheds more light on the convicted killer 's complicated family history , his daughter @entity1 is missing without trace since 2005			1
@entity10 changed his name to @entity4 , taking his mother 's maiden name some time after he broke up with his first wife , @entity29			1
he also has a son he has not seen in many years			2
@entity32 's brother claims he has been told @entity10 is suspected of having some involvement in his daughter 's disappearance			2
police in @entity37 who investigated @entity32 's murder referred questions to @entity41 , where the then 34 - year - old @entity42 disappeared			1
detectives in @entity3 were unable last night to confirm whether @entity10 was ever looked at or questioned in connection with the disappearance			1
but @entity46 , 11 at the time of his little sister 's abduction , said he was told by the local @entity51 's office that @entity10 's daughter had disappeared			1
' i think it 's a sad , sad situation that he was not arrested and confined long before this because i am certain there are other victims over these many years , ' mr @entity46 said			1
' i have no doubt whatsoever			2
as a matter of fact his own daughter is missing and he 's suspected of having something to do with that			1
cold case : @entity4 's conviction in @entity4 's 1957 abduction closes one case , but the matter of his missing daughter remains open historic : the disappearance of little @entity32 captivated and horrified the nation for 55 years ' i think that 's the real tragedy here and even in his older years i believe it is important for him to not be allowed to have any contact with the public			1
i believe he needs to remain in custody for the rest of his life			2
' @entity42 was last seen at a motel in @entity3 in june 2005			1
she was last seen with a boyfriend			2
she is listed as endangered missing , meaning police fear she may be dead			1
@entity4 's wife @entity89 , who is adamant her husband had nothing to do with the murder of @entity32 , said he had no physical contact with his daughter for many years			1
' she was into drugs			2
she left her kids with her mother and took off and that 's the last anyone heard of her			2
her boyfriends were of very bad quality			2
' suspicious : @entity32 's brother , @entity46 , says authorities suspect @entity10 of being involved in his daughter ' disappearance he spoke on the phone with her and at one point she planned to come to @entity107 , @entity108 , where they lived but it never happened			1
and in connection with the murder of @entity32 , @entity110 declared : ' @entity113 did not do this			2
' mrs @entity10 , unable to see her husband since he was first arrested in july 2011 and taken to @entity37 for trial , believes @entity10 did not stand a chance of being acquitted			1
' he 's got proof he was in @entity119			0
he was getting a military exam			0
a colonel and two sergeants gave affidavits that they had seen @entity113 this time , this time and the other time			0
' @entity113 never had a chance			0
they would not let any of the evidence that said where he was			0
' five affidavits taken by the @entity130 at the time , which placed @entity10 far from the murder scene , were ruled inadmissible by judge @entity133			2
in her very first ever interview , mrs @entity10 said : ' i know a person does not change			0
they do n't kill somebody and say oh that was fun but i will never do it again			0
he does not even kill bugs , he takes them outside			0
' he has already been gone for 14 months			0
he 's an old guy and he does not have many years to screw around with this			0
my only thing is trying to get @entity113 home			0
' but @entity46 said : ' regarding his conviction when i was given the details of the state 's case early on i never had any doubt that this was in fact the person who had kidnapped and murdered and murdered my sister			1
' however because of the age of this case we were cautioned from the very beginning by the @entity51 and many others that it would certainly be a hard case to prove but as time went on and the pieces began to fall into place i did not have any doubt that he would be convicted			1
' @entity164 to the prosecution case was a death bed statement by @entity10 's mother , @entity167			0
his half sister testified that her mother identified @entity10 as @entity32 's killer			0
also helping to convict @entity10 was @entity32 's best friend at the time , who picked the pensioner out of a photo line up as the same young man named @entity175 who was last seen with the young girl ahead of her disappearance			0
and the judge also took into account the evidence of three inmates who claimed @entity10 confessed to them while awaiting trial			0
@entity110 said another half sister , in the room when the confession was made , did not hear anything			0
she also questioned how the friend was able to identify her husband after 55 years as the same person as a teenager and dismissed altogether the testimony of the jailhouse snitches			0
but @entity10 opted for a bench trial , before a judge alone , without a jury			0
his wife said : ' we thought , wrongly of course , that because the judge had seen all five affidavits that he could not in good conscience convict someone who did not do anything			0

@entity4 was convicted last week of the murder and abduction of @entity46 , age 7 , in @entity37
his daughter @entity207 , 34 , is missing and it is not known whether she is alive or dead
she was last seen with her boyfriend in a motel in @entity3 , @entity41
