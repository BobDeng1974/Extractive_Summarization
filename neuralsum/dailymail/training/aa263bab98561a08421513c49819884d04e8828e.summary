by @entity1 reporter published : 02:27 est , 11 may 2012 updated : 03:52 est , 11 may 2012 teachers who make excuses and complain about their jobs ' do not know what stress is ' , the controversial chief inspector of @entity3 claimed today			1
tough - talking sir @entity9 , who this week demanded a crackdown on classroom ill - discipline , said @entity13 does not need school leaders whose first instinct is to blame others for failure , but those that are willing to tackle under - performance			1
sir @entity9 said that as heads have more power , pay and freedom than ever before , they should recognise the ' privileged ' position they are in			1
scathing attack : sir @entity9 , the chief inspector of @entity3 , has promised to launch a crackdown on classroom ill - discipline the @entity3 chief inspector also vowed to press ahead with his proposals to raise school standards in the face of widespread criticism from headteachers			1
he told a conference at @entity36 this morning that in the past , headteachers who were not prepared to tackle poor teaching were not challenged			0
sir @entity9 said : ' we need to learn from this and challenge those who have power invested in them to make the difference , but too often make excuses for poor performance - it ’s just too hard , the children are too difficult , the families are too unsupportive , this job is far too stressful , ' sir @entity9 said			1
' let me tell you what stress is			0
' stress is what my father felt , who struggled to find a job in the 1950s and 1960s and who often had to work long hours in three different jobs and at weekends to support a growing family			0
' stress is , i ’m sure , what many of the million and a half unemployed young people today feel - unable to get a job because they ’ve had a poor experience of school and lack the necessary skills and qualifications to find employment			0
' stress is what i was under when i started as a head in 1985 , in the context of widespread industrial action - teachers walking out of class at a moment ’s notice - doing lunch duty on my own every day for three years because of colleagues who worked to rule - covering five classes in the sports hall when there was no - one to teach them			0
criticism : sir @entity9 said most teachers do not know what real stress really is ' stress was , in the days before local management of schools , writing letters in triplicate to the local authority asking for a brick wall to be built in the playground or for a bit of extra money to keep an excellent maths teacher - and not receiving a reply for weeks			1
' i still bear the scars of those days			0
' the @entity3 chief 's no - nonsense comments came just days after he told the @entity1 that mobile phones should be banned in schools , and teachers marked down if they do n't enforced the ban			1
his tough new inspection regime also promises to tackle back - chatting and calling out in classrooms			0
sir @entity9 said that times have changed , and that heads are now in charge , with better pay and more independence , power and resources than before			1
' we need heads who know what a privileged position they are in now and who can use their new - found independence well - people who roll up their sleeves and get on with improving their schools , even in the most difficult circumstances			2
' what we do n’t need are leaders in our schools whose first recourse is to blame someone else - whether it ’s @entity3 , the local education authority , the government or a whole host of other people			2
' defence : @entity136 has described criticism aimed at sir @entity9 as ' misdirected ' sir @entity9 told the conference that the bar on school standards must be raised			1
' we must hold our nerve , ' he said			0
' i am determined to do so as chief inspector , and not panic at the first whiff of grapeshot , some of which has whistled past my ears over the last few days			0
' earlier this week sir @entity9 was accused of using ' bully - boy tactics ' by heads at the @entity152 ( @entity152 ) annual conference			1
the union passed an emergency motion which said they were ' saddened and dismayed ' by his approach			0
the move represented a further deterioration of relations between the union and @entity3 , and came just days after the @entity152 raised concerns over the variable quality of inspections and the watchdog ’s planned changes to the inspection system			2
proposing the motion , @entity167 , an @entity168 headteacher , had told the @entity152 ’s conference : ' fear reigns and confidence wanes as @entity3 waves its stick ! ' it is time to stand up to ' bully - boy tactics ' , he added			2
education secretary @entity136 backed the @entity3 chief in his speech to @entity36 today , telling delegates : ' there ’s been some criticism recently of the new inspections framework and the new chief inspector			1
' i ’ve listened to that criticism - i ’ve considered carefully the arguments made - and i have to say on reflection - it ’s misdirected at best , mischievous at worst			0
' sir @entity9 is a visionary school leader who has spent his career in the state sector and has achieved amazing results for children from the poorest homes - when his critics achieve results like him , then i ’ll believe their arguments carry the same weight as his experience			2
' he is determined to improve inspection , drive up standards , encourage great teaching and celebrate good leadership - he deserves the backing of everyone who wants children to succeed - and i shall do everything to ensure that whatever he wants - he gets			0
