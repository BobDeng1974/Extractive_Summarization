by @entity0 published : 19:01 est , 12 march 2013 updated : 19:26 est , 12 march 2013 @entity1 : sir @entity2 , chairman of the @entity3 , says the children of families in rural areas do n't have a @entity8 - given right to live near their parents children raised in the countryside have no automatic right to live near their parents ’ homes when they grow up , the chairman of the @entity3 declared yesterday			1
sir @entity2 said the majority of new homes should be built in towns and cities , rather than in unspoilt rural areas			1
his comments are at odds with existing policies that encourage affordable housing to be built in villages for local families			1
sir @entity2 said : ‘ somehow it is considered the right of people in the country to have their children living next door at public expense			1
i do n’t understand it			0
‘ are you going to say that people who have lived in the @entity38 [ in the @entity39 ] for 100 years have a right to go on living there ? no , i ’m afraid they do n’t			0
’ last night , some countryside groups attacked his comments , warning that villages without young families risked being turned into ‘ little more than retirement ghettoes ’			1
but sir @entity2 , who owns homes in west @entity46 and rural @entity47 , even called for areas of the countryside to be listed to protect the most beautiful parts			1
he suggested introducing four different listed ‘ grades ’ of countryside – one of which could include a ‘ presumption against development ’			2
he said : ‘ we should list the countryside as we list the town by virtue of its @entity61 it is that people want to retain			2
‘ we do n’t want to pull down @entity64			0
we do n’t want to build housing estates in @entity66			0
we should adopt the same approach to the countryside			2
’ picturesque : @entity70 in the @entity39			0
families who have lived in villages like this do not have a right to go on living there , says sir @entity2			1
he says the majority of new homes should be built in towns and cities idyll : the village of @entity82 in the @entity39			1
many countryside groups say there is an urgent need for affordable homes in rural areas but opponents warned that house prices will rise even higher in rural areas if new homes are not built there			1
the row comes at a time when the average home in the countryside costs around £ 200,000 – around £ 30,000 more than a town house			2
under threat ? @entity97 in @entity98			0
a minister said @entity100 faces a situation where home ownership is the right of a privileged few unless more homes are built the @entity106 is a river in the @entity39 , which flows through the famously picturesque village of @entity109 as well as the prime minister ’s constituency town of @entity112			1
prices of homes near the @entity106 can be eye - watering , with bungalows in @entity109 selling for up to £ 645,000 in recent months			2
but sir @entity2 , who was speaking in a personal capacity , told the @entity118 ’ @entity120 conference in central @entity46 : ‘ i want building to take place in towns on the whole			1
i want there to be massive incentives to build in towns because it makes more sense			0
’ he said there will be many parts of the countryside – ‘ on the whole , rather lovely parts of the countryside ’ – that ‘ just do n’t want to take large numbers of more people			2
’ he singled out the @entity39 village of @entity137 , where he said many residents are ‘ seriously angry ’ at proposals to build a large number of new homes			0
last night his comments were attacked by those who said more affordable rural homes were needed			1
@entity145 , executive chairman of the @entity146 , said : ‘ we need to be providing homes across the country in places where people want to live			1
we should not be trying to just pigeon - hole people into living in towns where they might not want to live			0
’ @entity155 , from the @entity156 , said : ‘ we do agree that the bulk of new housing should be built in or near to urban areas , so people have more easy access to public transport , community facilities and essential services			2
sir @entity2 said protecting villages like @entity166 from major housing developments and concentrating new homes in towns and cities ' makes sense ' ‘ however , if we do n’t make provision for at least some affordable houses in rural areas , where it is clear that there is need and people do want to stay , then our villages could become little more than retirement ghettoes or commuter dormitories			1
’ at the conference , @entity182 , chairman of house builders @entity184 , accused sir @entity2 of being ‘ quite naïve ’			1
he said : ‘ these are your children			0
these are people who already live in the community			0
we have failed for year after year after year to provide the housing			0
that is a real issue in @entity100			0
’ in @entity191 , around 110,000 new homes are built ever year , but this is way behind the rate at which new households are being formed , estimated to be around 230,000 a year			2
a spokesman for @entity195 , the first - time buyers ’ campaign group , accused sir @entity2 of being ‘ out of touch with the aspirations of hard - working young adults who have been priced out of a home in their local area			1
’ housing minister @entity202 , who spoke at the same conference , said home ownership remains the dream of the vast majority of @entity207			0
he told builders that the quality of the homes they build is just as important as the quantity , calling on them to reject the stereotype of the ‘ rabbit hutch ’			0
sir @entity2 ’s intervention comes weeks after planning minister @entity216 warned @entity100 will be dragged back to the 19th century when home - ownership was the preserve of the wealthiest unless more homes are built			1
he said : ‘ we can pass by on the other side while working men and women in their twenties and thirties have to live with their parents or share bedrooms with friends			0
we can shrug our shoulders as home ownership reverts to what it was in the 19th century : a privilege , the exclusive preserve of people with large incomes or wealthy parents			0
‘ or we can accept that we are going to have to build on previously undeveloped land and resolve that we will make these decisions locally			0

sir @entity2 rails against more homes being built in the countryside
he says families have no automatic right to live in rural areas
but campaigners say villages without young will be ' retirement ghettoes '
