by @entity0 published : 04:07 est , 24 june 2013 updated : 17:33 est , 24 june 2013 a group of @entity3 ex-pats are this morning in court after being arrested in a dramatic raid police on a bar in @entity7			1
officers swooped on the @entity9 , in the resort of @entity11 , for breaching the country 's strict gambling laws			1
but the major sting operation was not closing the net on a high - level , international gang of criminals , running a multi-million - euro gambling ring			2
instead , it was the sedate game of bingo			2
high stakes : landlady @entity22 , fourth right , pictured with some of her @entity3 ex-pat customers who were ' rounded up like gangsters ' for playing bingo undercover detectives , who had staked out their target for two weeks , sprung their trap moments after the prizes - a tin of biscuits and a bar of chocolate - were given out			1
the bar was full of @entity3 holidaymakers , aged from 23 to 76 who were taken away to a police station and questioned for four hours			1
pub landlady @entity22 , 34 , told the @entity38 : ' they rounded us all up like a bunch of gangsters at about 11pm			1
it was 3am by the time they let us all go			2
' the mother - of - one , originally from @entity47 , is among the group this morning up before a @entity7 court for further questioning over allegations they failed to apply for a government licence to hold the bingo game			1
if found guilty , they face a fine of between £ 1,300 and £ 8,500			1
a post on the pub 's facebook page read : ' while we do not disagree that bingo is a form of gambling , the @entity7 bars can & do have raffles without a problem			2
stunned : @entity9 landlady @entity22 and her partner @entity67 were shocked when @entity7 police swooped on their game of bingo in the nick : those arrested at the @entity73 , aged 23 to 70 , were taken to the local police station where they were held for four hours taken in : @entity3 expatriate @entity76 shows a notice of apprehension issued by the @entity7 police outside the @entity73 in @entity11 ' some even charge € 10 to take part in a poker game , the prize is a pig ( live )			1
others advertise on local radio			2
must go to bed now as court at 9am			0
' but they managed to see the funny side of their predicament , adding in another post : ' never a dull moment , free transport to the local nick included in your night out			0
see the @entity97 by night , conducted tour by uniformed guides			0
the almost farcical drama unfolded on friday evening , a few seconds after 74 - year - old @entity100 , from @entity101 , @entity102 , picked up his prize			0
the plain - clothed detectives told him to write his name on the back of the bingo card , which was then placed in a sealed , evidence bag			0
breaking the law : the bar was full of holidaying @entity3 and ex-pats when police swooped the @entity9 over an ' illegal ' bingo game in tradition : the @entity9 owners @entity67 and @entity22 pointed out on their @entity118 page that @entity7 bars hold bingos and raffles with prizes including live pigs @entity124 : police swooped on the @entity9 , pictured , as they finished a game of bingo police confiscated his biscuits , but he says he managed to hide the chocolate			1
officers rounded up even those in the bar who were not even taking part in the game and arrested them for ' observing a crime '			1
another post on the pub 's facebook page added : ' @entity100 won the first line , a tin of biscuits & a bar of chocolate			0
they even took them as evidence			0
by the way @entity149 was n't playing either but that does n't matter , he still ended up in the nick			0
' when @entity149 was told that he observed the crime , he was now responsible & must share the responsibility			0
' when i asked if i watched the euro millions being drawn , would i have to share the winnings ? no , that gambling is @entity159 now we know , do it for a packet of biscuits & you get banged up			0
do it for millions & that 's ok			0

police spent two weeks staking out the @entity9 , in @entity11
officers quiz ex-pats for four hours for breaching strict *anti-gambling* laws
landlady @entity22 said : ' they rounded us up like a gangsters '
group face fine of up to £ 8,500 if *convicted*
