the cable company recently rejected his initial $ 80billion bid from @entity8 , but apparently @entity3 is ready to up the ante above $ 85 a share , sources told @entity12			1
if accepted , the takeover would be the biggest media deal in more than a decade			1
pictured above on wednesday , speaking at the @entity19 conference in @entity20 the move could create a mega-sized media conglomerate that owns rights to dozens of popular tv shows and thousands of films , as well as cable tv networks and local broadcast tv channels			1
such a company would be a content provider powerful enough to aggressively negotiate with cable companies and internet service providers			2
it 's estimated that @entity8 would save nearly $ 1billion annually by eliminating overlapping staff			1
@entity3 also criticised ' subservient politicians stifling economic growth ' as he spoke at a meeting of the @entity38 leaders in @entity20 details of the @entity4 bid were released this week just one day before @entity3 appeared at a @entity19 conference in @entity20 , @entity42 and criticized the excessive financial red tape in free market economies			1
if @entity3 proceeds with the @entity4 takeover , it would be heavily scrutinized by antitrust regulators			1
@entity8 would likely have to sell @entity48 to appease the regulators since the company already has it 's own 24 - hour news network			1
he says that the @entity53 governments need to ' take a back seat ' and allow businesses to drive economic growth			0
he said @entity58 president @entity57 was penalising businesses by cracking down on so - called ' profit shifting ' by major corporations to countries with lighter tax regimes , a technique that is also in the sights of the @entity53			0
' my blood pressure goes up when i think of the number of local , state and federal regulations we have in our lives today , ' the 83 - year - old @entity42 billionaire told the meeting			0
' that is just in @entity58			0
do n't even get me started on the @entity75			0
' @entity3 , who did not refer to the @entity4 bid during the meeting , has his eye on the media conglomerate , which owns @entity48 , @entity79 , @entity80 , among other big - name media properties			1
experts say he is n't likely to give up after one rejection			0
sources told @entity12 that @entity3 has n't been directly involved in the discussions			1
the @entity19 was set up in 2010 to give policy recommendations on behalf of the international business community to the @entity53			0
@entity3 was speaking at the meeting a day after it was revealed his @entity8 made an $ 80 billion offer for @entity91 , which was rejected business leaders meeting here are looking to influence the outcome of the @entity95 in @entity96 in november			1
@entity3 told the meeting : ' i believe that business does have a role in shaping public policy , mainly in helping limit the size and scope of government			2
' for businesses large and small , there 's simply too much red tape , too many subservient politicians stifling economic growth and entrepreneurism			2
' the @entity53 is targeting growth of two per cent above trend over the next five years			0
it is also tackling corporate ' profit shifting ' , which has allowed multinationals such as @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 to avoid paying taxes			0
@entity53 finance ministers in february endorsed a set of common standards for sharing bank account information across borders , with automatic exchange of information among @entity53 members to take effect by the end of 2015			0
@entity57 , meanwhile , earlier this year proposed tightening restrictions on @entity58 multinationals that shift their tax domiciles abroad in his 2015 budget			0
@entity57 wants to raise the minimum level of foreign ownership in a newly inverted holding company to 50 per cent from about 20 per cent , making the deals more difficult to carry out			2
' do we really expect overseas companies to voluntarily bring profits back to be taxed at 35 to 40 percent in the @entity58 , when the corporate tax rate in @entity142 is 12.5 per cent ? ' @entity3 said			2
' this is not the way to achieve economic growth			0

sources say @entity3 will make a second bid to *buy* @entity4
his initial offer of $ 80billion was rejected by the cable company
it 's estimated that @entity8 will save more than $ 1billion by acquiring the cable giant
if accepted , it would be the biggest media deal in more than a decade
