by @entity0 the leaking of secret surveillance techniques by @entity3 has made the world a more dangerous place , a top officer warned last night			1
@entity7 said the former @entity11 @entity10 contractor ’s disclosures , printed by @entity13 newspaper , caused ‘ enormous damage ’ and ‘ hand [ ed ] the advantage to terrorists ’			1
the @entity19 assistant commissioner added : ‘ the so - called @entity3 revelations have made our work more difficult			1
the actions he took helped to signal to people who may try to do us harm how to avoid surveillance and other techniques			1
former @entity30 agent @entity3 made the world a more dangerous place through leaking secret surveillance techniques , a top officer has warned ‘ in my view that is not going to make the world safer , it is going to make it more dangerous			1
it has affected public confidence in our abilities to do a job that i believe we do carefully , proportionately and using our powers sparingly within the law			0
’ speaking to a meeting of police chiefs in her last days as @entity46 ’s top counter-terrorism officer , miss @entity7 said the police were ‘ staring into the abyss ’ because of a political deadlock over access to sensitive internet communications			2
terrorists and other top - level criminals were taking advantage of rapidly changing technology to evade the security services			2
@entity7 , @entity19 assistant commissioner , told police chiefs that the leaks had affected public confidence in police abilities politicians must get to grips with laws allowing police to use so - called ‘ communications data ’ , miss @entity7 said , adding that terrorist investigations will be hampered unless police and spies can retain data , including internet browsing and emails			1
she said : ‘ i believe that as technology changes , we are beginning to stare into the abyss			0
make no mistake , continuing erosion of this capability without the necessary legislative changes will severely impact on our ability to continue terrorist investigations			0
’ asked about the outbreak of extreme violence in @entity83 , miss @entity7 said the security services were watching the ‘ ghastly conflagration ’ closely			2
she said : ‘ it is clearly an enormous world - changing event which will have all sorts of ramifications and it may or may not heighten the risk to the @entity46 of terrorism			0
’ she added that police had no information yet that @entity46 jihadists have travelled from @entity97 to join the wave of barbaric @entity100 fighters			0
but she said police were conscious that hundreds of @entity46 fighting the regime of @entity102 could move and threaten other areas in the world			0
miss @entity7 also appealed to the government to leave terrorism units in the hands of police forces , including the @entity109 , rather than hand them to the @entity110			2
she said a ‘ messy divorce ’ risked making the police response to complex terrorist threats less effective and more difficult to co-ordinate .			0
