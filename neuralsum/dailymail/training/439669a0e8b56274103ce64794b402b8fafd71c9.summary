it 's a scheme that saw @entity1 face a middle - class backlash over complaints that its stores were being invaded by less well - off shoppers			1
and now the retailer has decided to introduce a stricter policy on its free tea or coffee option for @entity12 loyalty card holders when drinking at its in - store cafés , as a retail expert claimed it could cost as much as £ 150,000 a week to provide the perk			1
it has trialled a scheme at six stores in @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 whereby free drinks are only available at the café till to customers buying food as well			1
this could be anything from a cake to a sandwich or even a full meal - but at these stores you can still get a no - strings - attached free drink from the self - service machine			1
changes : from february 9 all members will be asked to buy food if enjoying a free drink in a @entity1 café and from february 9 cardholders will be asked to buy food if enjoying their drink at all of its cafés			1
the offer - introduced in 2011 - has allowed anybody with a card to pick up a free @entity51 , cappuccino , latte , tea , mocha or espresso every day - even if they do not spend anything in store			1
in some stores , including at @entity61 in central @entity62 , the free coffee cups are stored at the tills - although customers with a @entity12 card do not have to make a purchase to receive one			1
today @entity70 newspaper reported that customers do need a shopping receipt at the @entity61 store to get their free tea or coffee , but this was denied by @entity1			1
the popularity of the mywaitrose card offer has made the retailer the second largest provider of coffee in the @entity82 , with its stores shifting one million cups a week			2
popular : the loyalty scheme has five million members , with @entity1 giving out an estimated one million free teas or coffees every week			2
shoppers can also get a free newspaper when spending more than £ 5 @entity90 , director of the retail consultancy @entity91 , told @entity92 : ‘ it was a very good commercial marketing ploy that has over the last few years become a little bit abused			2
‘ it costs them money to do it and they ’ve got to ask themselves is it worth it ? [ @entity103 supermarket chain ] booths do exactly the same thing			0
does it really benefit the actual @entity1 customer ? ‘ the execution of it at store level has been a little poor and allowed people to come in , get a free coffee and then not really shop - and a lot of these people would tend to do that on a frequent basis			2
‘ that was not the intent of the card			0
the intent was a thank you from @entity1			0
i think @entity1 when they did it were under pressure from all the other supermarkets doing a price war			0
‘ they wanted to make a statement to their customers saying “ we ’re different too ”			0
it ’s just a sort of expression of the fact that they were different			0
’ the loyalty scheme has five million members , with @entity1 giving out an estimated one million free teas or coffees every week			2
shoppers with the card can also get a free newspaper when spending more than £ 5			2
mr @entity90 said he estimated that the ingredients of the tea or coffee available at @entity1 would come in at between 12p and 15p , meaning that it could be costing the supermarket as much as £ 150,000 a week to provide the perk			0
but he added : ‘ some of that will be extremely beneficial to them as they ’re getting new customers , but we do n’t how much of that is being abused			0
that ’s the unknown quantity			0
' a statement on the @entity1 website said : ‘ from february 9 we will be asking @entity12 members who wish to enjoy their free tea or coffee in one of our cafés to also purchase a treat - such as a sandwich , cake , biscuit or piece of fruit			1
‘ this change will enable us to continue to offer our customers the enjoyable service they expect			0
’ choices : the popularity of the @entity12 card offer has made the retailer the second largest provider of coffee in the @entity82 , with its stores shifting one million cups a week @entity176 rise : this graph published last week on the @entity179 website shows @entity1 's weekly sales figures up to week 25 ( to january 17 , 2015 ) , compared to the same weeks in 2013 - 14 and 2012 - 13 and a @entity1 spokesman told @entity92 today : ‘ a complimentary tea or coffee while shopping with us is one of our ways of saying thank you to our customers			1
‘ most people who have their @entity12 free drink in the café understand that they should buy something from the café to have with their tea or coffee , and so we are simply confirming that			1
‘ @entity195 members who would like to drink their free tea or coffee in the café will also need to buy something , in the café such as a sandwich , cake or piece of fruit to go with their drink			1
customers can still buy a drink in the café too			2
‘ @entity12 customers can still get their free hot drink from the self - serve machines whilst they are shopping with us			1
’ last september @entity1 reported operating profit fell 9.4 per cent to £ 145million because of - among other factors - ' substantial ' investment in stores , its website and the @entity12 scheme			1
in december 2013 the @entity220 reported how regular @entity1 customers claimed the supermarket 's offer of free cups of tea and coffee in all its stores was attracting the wrong type of clientele			1
long - standing customers said at the time that the move was encouraging large numbers of @entity12 cardholders who have no intention of shopping and merely get in the way			1
@entity1 boss @entity238 said he believed that shoppers want instant rewards , such as free coffee , rather than the ' meaningless ' benefits offered by conventional supermarket loyalty cards			2
and in march 2014 the @entity220 told how a woman had to go to the @entity245 in @entity246 after drinking a free coffee from a @entity1 store that contained cleaning fluid			0
paramedics were called to the branch of the supermarket in @entity253 , @entity254 , and advised her to visit a burns unit , although she is thought to have attended a local @entity257 instead			0
@entity1 apologised for the ' unfortunate incident ' and sent her a £ 25 voucher			0
a spokesman said : ‘ we have confirmed that the cleaning fluid does not have any long term impact on health			0
' the next month @entity92 revealed how a second customer had fallen ill after drinking a free coffee from @entity1 that was contaminated with cleaning fluid			0
father - of - two @entity268 , 49 , was in a rush when he grabbed a free cappuccino at the branch in @entity273 , @entity274 , but felt sick after drinking it			0
the supermarket chain apologised to mr @entity268 , and offered him £ 25 compensation , but he returned the money because the amount was ' insulting ' - and was then presented with £ 100			0
a spokesman for @entity1 said at the time : ‘ mr @entity268 should not have been able to pour a drink while the machine was being rinsed - and we have taken action to prevent it happening again			2
