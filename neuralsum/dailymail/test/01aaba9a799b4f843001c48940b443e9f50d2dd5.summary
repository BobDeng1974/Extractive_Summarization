it came as ms @entity17 , 70 , who first presented the show 38 years ago , said she would be keen to return to the motoring show if she were invited back			1
it 's not as much , however , as i 'll miss being there			2
' @entity0 was dropped by the @entity4 after an internal investigation found he had launched an ' unprovoked ' 30 - second physical attack on producer @entity33 because he was offered a plate of cold cuts instead of steak and chips			1
the presenter was found to have split the producer 's lip and verbally abused him			0
following weeks of speculation over the star 's future , @entity41 , the director - general of the corporation , publicly announced that the @entity4 would not be renewing @entity0 's contract			1
he said @entity0 had ' crossed the line ' and that ' there can not be one rule for one and one rule for another '			1
now , with the future of the show still up in the air , former newsreader ms @entity17 said it would be ' great ' if she was invited back			1
@entity0 , who was dropped by the @entity4 after launching an ' unprovoked ' 30 - second physical attack on producer @entity33			1
today gave his ' heartfelt thanks ' to those who have supported him she told @entity60 : ' it would be great if they said " let 's get the old girl back to do the odd film for us "			1
what i did all those years ago is totally different to what they do now			0
' if a programme is going to have longevity , which @entity2 has , it has to keep evolving			0
' she added that there should be a woman included in the team - because half the drivers on the road are female			2
@entity79 , the former model , has already been linked to the show			2
it also emerged last month that @entity83 star @entity82 could become the new @entity2 presenter because the @entity4 believe he is a ' safe pair of hands '			0
meanwhile , @entity4 bosses are said to be desperately trying to hold onto @entity88 ( left ) and @entity89 ( right ) - @entity0 's co-presenters - for the @entity4 show mr may has previously said that the trio ' came as a package ' , while @entity89 - not ruling out a return - said the sacking marked ' the end of an era ' but @entity4 bosses are reportedly still trying to persuade @entity89 and @entity88 to continue with the show , in a bid to cling onto long - term fans			1
although may , 52 , and @entity89 , 45 , have both hinted separately that they do not see a future with @entity2 , both have remained silent on the issue for the past few weeks			2
a source told the @entity60 : ' @entity89 is a tv presenter and this could be his chance to become top dog - he 's been on the show a bit longer than @entity88			1
that is a big opportunity to pass over			0
' they added : ' it would be a great shame to lose all the talent in one go - re-booting it from scratch would be a far harder task than replacing one			0
' mr may has previously said that the trio ' came as a package ' , while @entity89 - not ruling out a return - said the sacking marked ' the end of an era '			1
but little has been said since the initial reaction to the sacking			0
some believe the presenters are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels , which may want to sign up the group as a trio			0
all three were on the cusp of signing new three - year deals when the @entity0 fracas unfolded			2
some believe the pair are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels , which may want to snap up the former @entity2 group as a trio the day after @entity0 's sacking , may gave a big hint that he has no plans to return to @entity2 , suggesting he is to ‘ go back to normal life			1
’ the presenter admitted he was already considering what to do next with his life - and suggested he might even ditch cars to become a teacher			0
he said : ' i might want to do something completely different with my life , i 'm quite old now			0
( i might do ) something outside of cars , i always wanted to be a teacher			0
' he also seemed to confirm speculation that he would leave the top - rating programme , saying : ' we always knew it was n't going to last forever '			0
@entity0 , 54 , was sacked after attacking @entity33 in an episode which @entity41 said had ' crossed the line ' but the @entity4 's creative director @entity161 previously made it clear he wanted may and @entity89 to continue presenting the show without @entity0 , despite acknowledging it would be ' perfectly natural ' for them to have reservations about continuing			1
he said : ' it 's perfectly natural for them			0
they are a team they have worked together for a very long time , they are all very attached			0
' if @entity0 is not in it and @entity89 and @entity88 are , that needs to be a conversation with them as well			1
they need to be happy about what 's going on and where they think the programme needs to be			0
' may fronts several other tv programmes , including the popular @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 and @entity88 ' @entity187 with wine expert @entity186			2
@entity89 has a successful career as a children ’s television host , fronting the second series of @entity193 's @entity192			2
he also hosted @entity196 ’s physical game show @entity194 and the @entity198 series @entity199 before they were axed			0
@entity0 , may and @entity89 are scheduled to take part in the live @entity2 shows next month			1

earlier this month @entity203 said that following an investigation @entity0 would face no further police action over his attack on the producer at a hotel			2
@entity0 pulled out of his planned appearance hosting @entity4 satirical show @entity210 , which was due to be filmed next week , and aired a day later			2
