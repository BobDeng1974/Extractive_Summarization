clambering down from his tiny coffin - sized shack built into the steel girders of its huge frame , this is the man who lives in @entity8			1
calling the @entity11 landmark home for the past year , he has managed to quietly come and go - while millions of oblivious commuters have rushed past his makeshift wooden home without a second thought or glance			1
emerging daily at dawn with only the odd cyclist or early morning subway rider for company , the man was only first - sighted recently - prompting a report of a suicide attempt as he safely climbed back into his home boxed in between the subway and bike lane			2
scroll down for @entity26 emerging : this is the man believed to be called ' @entity28 ' who lives in @entity8 and was photographed leaving his makeshift home on tuesday morning speaking heavily accented @entity31 , the man offered up his name as @entity28 and said that he had arrived in @entity11 13 - years previously from @entity33			1
climbing down : the man - who is originally from @entity33 - has lived in the bridge in secret for the past year when asked where he had lived in @entity33 before arriving in the @entity38 , middle - aged @entity28 said that he had worked in @entity39 , but had left to try and find a better life in the @entity38			1
claiming to have suffered a financial loss through gambling , @entity28 said that for the past year he has called the @entity8 his home - constructing the base between the girders using wood discarded from nearby @entity47			1
indeed , dotted around the shack built into the bridge are evidence of his shanty construction - wooden boards and used water bottles litter the area			1
@entity28 said that there were others who lived in or near to the bridge - including one woman who had moved her worldly possessions off the cycling ramp to the entrance of of the famous structure finished in 1912			2
surprisingly well dressed for a man who lives in a bridge , @entity28 said that the brutal winter that @entity11 and the nation just experienced was difficult to endure			2
left to his climb back into his home , @entity28 has said that he is working on a second shack just 15 - feet up the ramp from his current abode			2
each of the cramped homes are around ten feet - by - one - and - a - half feet and seem to be protected with bike locks			0
good morning : the man makes his way down from his shack at dawn - to avoid the hundreds of thousands of people who use the bridge on a weekly basis discarded materials : water bottles and wooden planks litter the area where ' @entity28 ' has built his home in the @entity8 daylight : ' @entity28 ' explains that he has been coming and going from the @entity8 for the past year - until a reported suicide attempt - which was in fact him climbing into his home - revealed him to @entity11 home : after speaking for a moment - ' @entity28 ' returned to his shack to replace his umbrella after it stopped raining admittedly the dwellings , narrow spaces just big enough for one person to lie down , are cramped , but they provide shelter for people who otherwise have to brave the elements			1
the @entity100 first reported on sunday about a middle - aged @entity33 man who was seen locking his plywood ' door ' with a bicycle lock each morning and return for the evening to sleep			1
to reach the dwelling , which is built into the bridge frame on the @entity8 side of the bridge , he climbs a chain - link fence			0
last sunday a cyclst saw the man climbing to his rustic nook and mistook him for a jumper , calling 911 to report what he thought was an impending suicide			0
dwelling : this is ' @entity117 - seen in daylight in the @entity8 @entity28 likely picked this spot because it is part of a short expanse of the bike path where there is a roof			2
there is also no roof over the pedestrian walkway			0
' people are really desperate for places to stay			0
i say , if he ’s not bothering anybody , he ’s not bothering me			0
leave him alone , ' @entity132 , a passerby riding her bike near the shantytown told the @entity100			0
the pods are built into the underside of the upper deck of the bridge , below car traffic and above the subway			0
secret : his home is accessed by climbing over the steel railings to seen in the image and up and inside the girders			0
