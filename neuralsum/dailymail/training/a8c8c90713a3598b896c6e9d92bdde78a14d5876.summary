a group of board members from one of @entity4 's most luxury apartment buildings are trying to shut down construction of a new multi-million dollar spa because of its nudist - friendly policies which they say ' violate public morals '			1
the stuffy campaigners , who have lodged their suit in the @entity12 , live in the @entity13 on @entity14 , which overlooks the neighboring @entity15 , the home of the first @entity4 - based @entity16			2
despite the fact that the venue only allows guests to be nude while they are indoors , the residents insist that their scenic views of the city will be forever marred whenever they catch a glimpse of the spa 's more free - spirited guests who choose to enjoy its many amenities while in the buff			1
restricted rooftop : according to the lawsuit which was filed in the @entity12 , the spa 's rooftop amenities are in violation of a 40 - year - old building resctriction no clothes ? no way ! the board members insist that the spa 's nudity - friendly policy ' violates public morals ' while the majority of @entity42 have rejoiced at the arrival of the new mega-spa , which already has a sister site in @entity46 , it appears that prospect of having the luxurious , but nudist - friendly , venue right on their doorstep has done nothing but anger the @entity13 board			1
and it 's not just the thought of glimpsing naked spa - goers that has riled the campaigners			2
in addition to their fears about preserving the neighborhood 's moral code , the group also argue that the spa 's rooftop construction violates a 1974 restriction which prevents the @entity15 from being any higher than 82.35 feet			1
according to @entity67 , the restriction ensures that they be granted ' unrestricted light , air , and a view over a portion of the @entity15 building ' , all of which are under threat thanks to the spa 's construction			1
the group 's lawsuit specifies that the @entity82 's impressive array of rooftop comforts - which include hot tubs , foot - soaking stations and a cabana - style roof - are all in violation of the height restriction and must therefore be removed			1
' the height , placement and use of the newly constructed roof and spa facilities ... [ and ] their proximity to the windows of the residential apartments in 465 @entity14 , obstruct the view of the tenants and residents who occupy the apartments overlooking the roof of the @entity15 , ' the suit says , according to the @entity103			0
@entity105 standards : the residents of the @entity13 on @entity14 are also angered by the spa 's rooftop construction which they say violates local building restrictions luxury lifestyle : despite the @entity80 's anger , many other manhattanites are eagerly awaiting the spa 's launch ' [ the ] ongoing construction constitutes a public nuisance because it offends , interferes with , and causes damage to the public , including by offending public morals			1
' despite the group 's complaints however , construction on the luxurious venue has not only continued but has , they argue , actually sped up since they sent their first cease and desist letter back in september			2
according to the riled - up residents of the @entity13 , where a four - bedroom apartment goes for an average of $ 3.6 million , work now begins as early as 7am , even on sundays , an outrage which seems to have only added to their anger			2
the @entity134 is set to be the first of a number of the @entity82 chain 's luxury brand extensions			2
it will be the first of its kind to be opened in the center of @entity4 , having already won over the local residents in @entity46 , the home of its first @entity145 venue			0
there 's no stopping them ! construction on the luxury venue has not stopped , despite the lawsuit , and the spa is still due to open later this month ' complete wellness for the mind and body ' : the spa 's website describes the new venue as an ' escape into the extraordinary ' ' located in the heart of @entity4 , premier 57 offers an escape into the extraordinary , ' the website explains			1
' what lie inside are ancient and worldly health cultures , designed to deliver complete wellness for the mind , body , and soul			0
' focused on heat therapy , @entity161 57 specializes in providing opulent hydrotherapy facilities along with a collection of unique sauna room treatments			0
first class spa treatments , savory snacks and beverages , and an outdoor roof deck only enhance the @entity161 experience found within			0
' the spa will take up the seventh , eighth and ninth floors of the @entity181 - as well as the rooftop - and is set to open later this month			0
@entity183 , a spokesperson for @entity82 , told @entity184 : ' in terms of @entity186 57 and pending litigation , @entity12 today denied the @entity189 ’s request for a temporary restraining order and set a further hearing for a later date			0
' under the terms of the easement , @entity134 is permitted to use the roof , and will vigorously defend against this lawsuit			0
regarding the rooftop area in question , full nudity is not permitted outside of the facility ’s designated male and female locker rooms and bathing area			0
