by @entity0 published : 07:25 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 18:35 est , 25 april 2013 incident : @entity2 , 31 , outside @entity4 's @entity3 , where she is suing @entity5 for £ 1m claiming she suffered crippling back injuries at work whilst picking up a dropped earring a fashion shop manager who says she suffered crippling back injuries while bending down to pick up an earring at work is claiming more than £ 1million in damages			1
@entity2 , 31 , is suing her employers saying she was left in ‘ unbearable pain ’ after trying to retrieve the earring , which had fallen under a display unit			1
she has had to undergo a spinal fusion operation for her ‘ irreparable ’ back injuries and now has no feeling in her left leg and foot			1
she also says she has not been able to work since			2
the accident happened when she tried to move the display unit to reach the earring while she was running a clothes and accessories concession at a branch of the @entity28 department store			1
she is suing @entity29 , the owner of the concession , for more than £ 1million , blaming breaches of health and safety regulations for her career - destroying back problems			1
but the company denies any wrongdoing , saying @entity39 ‘ should have used a stick ’ to retrieve the dropped earring and arguing that she was ‘ the author of her own misfortune ’			1
in a writ lodged at the @entity3 in @entity4 , her barrister , @entity43 , described how @entity39 , of @entity45 in @entity46 , was injured at the store in @entity48 , @entity49 , on january 9 , 2009			1
‘ she was performing a stock - take , ’ she said			2
‘ as she was inventorying some jewellery , she dropped an earring onto the floor			1
it fell underneath one of the gondolas [ display units ]			2
‘ she bent down and put her hand under the gondola to retrieve the earring			1
however , it had landed too far in from the edge and she was unable to reach it without moving the gondola			2
as she did so she heard a clicking noise and felt her back give way			1
‘ she experienced increasing levels of pain over the course of the day			0
when it became unbearable she was compelled to leave work and attend hospital for treatment			0
’ the barrister claims that @entity39 ’s employers were guilty of breaches of the @entity75 at @entity76 and the @entity77 1992 , and had ‘ failed to take reasonable steps to provide her with a safe system of work ’			0
in its defence to the action , @entity5 admits it ‘ owed her a duty of care as her employer at the time ’ but denies responsibility for any harm she suffered			0
lawyers for the company , which is based in @entity91 , @entity92 , said : ‘ miss @entity2 ’s work was light work			1
she had to move clothes … but she was not required to lift or carry anything of substance			0
‘ it was not her responsibility nor part of her job to move the stands and gondolas			0
miss @entity2 alleges she suffered injury when reaching for an earring which she had dropped on to the floor			1
it is denied it was sensible or reasonable or other than a breach of her own duty to take care to try to push or move the gondola to reach the earring			2
court : ms @entity2 says she hurt her back at this @entity114 in @entity48 , and blames an alleged health and safety breach ‘ if she proves the earring fell under the gondola , then she should have used a stick or other method of reaching under the gondola to pull the earring out , or she should have left it there until help was provided			1
‘ she should not have tried to move the gondola			0
she acted unreasonably , in breach of her manual handling training and was the author of her own misfortune			0
’ the case is due to come to trial in november			0
after a preliminary hearing yesterday , @entity5 ’s barrister , @entity132 , said miss @entity2 was making a ‘ large damages claim ’ in excess of £ 1million			1
@entity5 prides itself on its ‘ elegant clothing for young women and ladies ’			2
its range includes both formal and semi-formal clothing and its clothes are sold in @entity114 and @entity142			2
in 2011 a review called for a ‘ rebalancing ’ of safety laws and a dramatic reduction in the number of rules in the workplace			0
according to an estimate by the @entity152 at the time , worker accidents cost businesses almost £ 8billion a year in compensation			0
the government - commissioned study , led by professor @entity158 , of @entity159 , said the safety rules were a financial burden on companies			0
some employees were exploiting the law to sue their bosses for incidents caused by their own carelessness			0
the reforms on personal responsibility were backed by the @entity170 , which said that in some cases employers were being unfairly held liable for the ‘ negligence ’ of their staff			0
the government supported the findings of the review and is planning to implement them .			0

@entity2 , 31 , has handed @entity3 writ to clothing brand coast
she reached for earring and ' heard clicking noise and felt her back give way '
coast claim she should have used a stick to pick up the jewellery in 2009
