by @entity0 you ca n't sell just anything on @entity3			1
the @entity5 town of @entity6 got into trouble with the online marketplace yesterday when it posted a listing for a dead whale that washed onto its shores last week			2
mayor @entity12 says the town was informed that it was their responsibility to get rid of the rotting 40 - foot sperm whale , so like many people trying to get rid of something they did n't want they turned to @entity3			1
they were n't necessarily interested in making a profit off of the whale , @entity12 said , but rather just finding anyone willing to take it off their hands			0
any takers ? the town of @entity6 in @entity29 , @entity5 is trying to get rid of a 40 - foot sperm whale that washed ashore last week but as of monday afternoon , the advertisement had been pulled down by the site which outlaws the selling of animals , dead or alive , on their site			1
@entity12 was also informed by @entity36 that selling the endangered sperm whale carcass violates the federal act protecting species at risk			1
by the time the advertisement had been pulled down , the highest bid surpassed $ 2,000			1
@entity12 says they looked into moving the whale with a 50 - foot boat , but that the vessel was n't strong enough			2
the says they ca n't afford any other method of disposing the whale			0
now he hopes the bidders are still interested in the whale			0
the city is willing to give the whale away for free as long as someone will take responsibility for towing it away			0
no luck : the town initially tried selling the carcass on @entity3 , but that listing was taken down by the site for violating their policy against selling animals - alive or dead			1
bids reached over $ 2,000 before it was taken down ' we ’ll be glad to talk to them about giving them the whale , ' @entity12 told @entity71			1
' we ’re hoping that ’s not illegal			0
' @entity12 says the whale has n't started decomposing yet , but believes that 's because it 's still partially covered in ocean water in near freezing temperatures			0
the mayor would like to see the whale gone before that though , telling the @entity81 that ' the smell of rotting fat is horrible '			0
this is the fourth whale that has washed up this @entity86 in @entity29			2
when two blue whales washed up last week , the @entity87 offered to presrve the marine animals			0

a 40 - foot sperm whale washed up on the shores of @entity93 in @entity29 last week
the city was told it was their responsibility to dispose of the whale so they listed it on @entity3
bids surpassed $ 2,000 by the time @entity3 took the advertisement down , citing a rule that says you ca n't sell animals - alive or dead
@entity36 also told the town that it was against the law to sell an endangered species , even it was dead
the town is hoping one of the *original* bidders is still interested in taking the whale , free of *charge*
this is the fourth whale to wash up on @entity29 this spring
