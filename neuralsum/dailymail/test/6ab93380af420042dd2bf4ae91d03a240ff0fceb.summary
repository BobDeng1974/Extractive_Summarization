doctors at @entity1 in @entity2 asked ms @entity7 to fast for five days after arriving at the hospital on march 30 with a swollen abdomen ' even if that test had been undertaken , she still would not have been able to have food and water by mouth because of the medical condition , so her treatment was correct , ' dr @entity20 told reporters			1
' it was n't that she was having to continue to fast waiting for the test - she had to fast because her medical condition required that to occur			0
' dr @entity20 said there had been miscommunication between staff and the patient and her family			0
' either they have n't understood , or have n't been given the full amount of information , ' he said			0
' it 's unfortunate they believe she 's been terribly treated when in fact the review of the medical notes suggests that that 's not the case			0
' dr @entity20 was confident based on the medical notes and his own treatment of patients with the same condition that ms @entity7 was cared for appropriately			1
he also apologised to the family for the incident			0
' clearly they do n't feel they 've been managed well and that means there 's been a communication issue , ' he said			0
