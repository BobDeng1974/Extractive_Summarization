migrants have helped push @entity2 ’s birth rate up to one of the highest levels in @entity5			1
women here are now likely to have an average of just under two children – a level exceeded only in two of the other 27 @entity13 countries			1
a decade ago , before large - scale immigration had a major impact on birth rates , @entity2 was firmly in the middle of the @entity5 table			1
@entity2 in bloom : women in the @entity2 are now likely to have an average of just under two children - a level exceeded only in two of the other 27 @entity13 countries since then , high fertility levels among migrants and a rapid rise in birth rates among women born here have helped push up the population faster than almost everywhere else in @entity5			1
figures released by the @entity13 ’s statistical arm @entity34 show the @entity2 birth rate – an average of 1.98 children per woman – had raced ahead of those in @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 by 2010			1
all six had higher birth rates than the @entity2 in 2000			2
only women in @entity49 , with a birth rate just ahead of ours at 2.03 , and @entity52 , at 2.07 , have more children			2
just over 723,000 babies were born in @entity55 and @entity56 in 2010 , up from fewer than 600,000 in 2000			0
the average number of children each woman is likely to have has gone up from 1.64			2
the main reason for the increase was immigration , with many migrants of child - bearing age , and with many from cultures where larger families are more common			0
the rising birth rate is also partially attributed to those born here in the 1960s and 70s having children later because they have been focusing on careers			0
having children has for many also been delayed by the need for a couple to maintain two incomes to cover mortgage and other costs			0
other @entity5 countries where birthrates have fallen have accepted fewer numbers of migrants than @entity2 and have not so far shown the same resurgence in baby numbers among women who in recent years have been delaying childbirth			1
@entity49 has had higher birth rates than @entity2 since the 1990s and its fertility levels are also pushed upwards by the arrival of high numbers of immigrants			2
the rising birth rate is also partially attributed to those born here in the 1960s and 70s having children later because they have been focusing on careers most recent figures show @entity2 birthrates have remained steady since 2010			1
the @entity101 said this may be because of ‘ government policy and the economic climate indirectly influencing individuals ’ decisions around childbearing and therefore affecting the number of births			0
’ however it added : ‘ the combined effect of multiple government policies and the changing economic climate does not have a clear impact on fertility in a particular direction			0
’ high birth rates in @entity2 are generally reckoned to be responsible for around 30 per cent of population increase			0
the growing population , especially in the south , has made @entity55 the most crowded country in @entity5 , except for tiny @entity43 .			0
