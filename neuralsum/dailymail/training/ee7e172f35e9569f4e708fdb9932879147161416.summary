@entity1 senator @entity0 is trailing her @entity3 challenger by a giant 16 - point margin in a runoff for one of @entity9 's two @entity8 seats , according to poll results obtained by @entity11			1
the survey , commissioned by @entity3 rep. @entity14 's campaign , was leaked to media in order to fire a shot over the senator 's bow and send a signal to energy lobbyists that her ship is taking on water			1
it suggests that @entity1 ' worst fears have been realized even though @entity0 edged @entity27 by 1 percentage point on @entity29			2
@entity30 to read the full poll @entity3 rep. @entity14 's campaign commissions polls daily , and the latest results show him in a commanding position over @entity1 sen. @entity0 @entity14 , a medical doctor , finished a close second on @entity29 but appears to have a clear advantage going into the dec. 6 runoff ; incoming senate majority leader @entity38 says if he wins he 'll get a seat on the @entity40 – undercutting @entity0 's strength in an oil - and - gas - heavy state a second @entity3 candidate , @entity45 , won 14 per cent of the vote on nov. 4 , enough to deny them both the 50 - percent showing required to avoid a december 6 runoff			1
now @entity45 has endorsed @entity14 , helping him erase his 1 - point deficit with @entity0 and adding far more			1
@entity14 is ' trying to shut @entity52 down for @entity0 ' by selectively releasing the polling data , a source close to his campaign in @entity9 told @entity11			1
' the energy folks , the lobbyists , keep trying to say she has a chance to win			1
that 's why it was leaked			2
' @entity0 has lined up for what @entity3 @entity60 aides are calling the ' @entity62 , ' a legislative strategy to save her @entity8 seat by winning a vote to approve the @entity66 , which would bring 700,000 barrels of oil daily from the @entity70 province of @entity71 to the @entity72			1
she may get her chance on tuesday if she can find 14 other democrats in the lame - duck @entity8 to join her in backing the project 's construction			2
all 45 @entity3 have already signed on			2
as of thursday one whip count shared with @entity11 found that she was just two votes short , giving her a 58 of the 60 votes she will need to override senate majority leader @entity82 's objections and force a roll call			2
@entity3 have fired back by making @entity14 the public face of the @entity86 bill			1
and sen. @entity38 , the @entity87 who will be the @entity8 's majority leader in january , vowed to give him a seat on the @entity40 if he wins			0
@entity0 's re-election campaign has rested squarely on the question of whether she has enough clout as the committee 's current chairwoman to pump new blood into @entity9 's sprawling energy infrastructure – including the 16 oil refineries operating there			1
she will lose her chairmanship weeks from now regardless of what happens since @entity3 will come back in january with a sizable @entity8 majority			2
the @entity3 campaign source hinted that if @entity0 were to mount a comeback , it would require super pac funding from the energy industry 's deep pockets			1
a 16 - point deficit , he said , might be enough to convince them to hang her out to dry			0
' and down here , ' the source added , ' we have to convince people that it 's not in the bag			0
' @entity0 now lacks the support of any out - of - state pacs , including the @entity119			2
since the outcome no longer affects which party will control the @entity8 – the @entity3 will have either a four - or five - seat edge – the @entity119 is saving its money for another day			2
@entity0 , the outgoing chair of the @entity124 , is trying to engineer a last - minute vote on the @entity66 oil pipeline as a ' @entity0 ' play to save her re-election bid @entity0 communications director @entity129 told @entity11 that the @entity3 's glasses are rose - colored past the point of credibility			1
but he would n't share any of the @entity134 's own internal poll numbers			0
' what our numbers show is that @entity0 is in a good position to win big on dec. 6 , just as she 's won all of her other close races , ' @entity129 said in a phone interview			1
he took issue with the automated nature of the @entity145 poll , which asked respondents to answer questions by pushing telephone buttons instead of talking with a pollster			2
@entity145 principal @entity150 confirmed via email that his firm ran a ' push - button ' poll for @entity14 's team			1
@entity150 's resulting memo discloses that 1,917 people provided answers , and assigns a 2.2 per cent margin of error to the result			0
@entity129 said that in the @entity0 campaign , ' we do n't do automated ' polls – only more traditional surveys			1
@entity150 countered with the email equivalent of a shoulder - shrug			0
' as with live surveys , there is no way to guarantee that each respondent is honest in their responses , ' he said			0
@entity150 also explained that his sample is balanced for race and other demographic features when phone numbers are culled from public voting records			0
' her campaign is running on fumes , ' @entity150 said in an email of @entity0 's re-election efforts			1
' she voted 97 % of the time with a president and a party who 62 % of the voters [ in @entity9 ] disapprove of			0
it is what it is			0
' @entity129 also objected to a series of set - up questions asked immediately before respondents were asked to choose a future senator			0
a recorded message asked @entity196 to decide which of four issues should be ' the top priority ' for the next @entity198			0
the only issues on the list were repealing @entity201 , protecting the @entity202 from terrorists , ramping up border security and ' addressing the illegal immigration problem , ' and shrinking the size of government			0
@entity14 lost on @entity29 but looks to be leading in the runoff since the other @entity3 in the race is supporting him reputation on the line : former secretary of state @entity212 posted a disappointing record on @entity29 , with losses raining down on six of the nine @entity8 candidates she stumped for ; a @entity0 win could diminish the feeling that her star is on the wane just as the 2016 presidential season gets ready to kick off @entity129 called those ' push - poll questions ' that might cause @entity1 to hang up before the crucial questions were asked			1
he also noted that the @entity66 did n't make the cut			0
' he 's pretending it 's important now , but where has he been on the pipeline ? ' he asked			0
one of the run - off contest 's most comical features has been the tit - for - tat skirmishes over the number of times @entity0 and @entity14 will debate			1
' we challenged him to six debates ... one for every year he wants to serve in the @entity8 , ' @entity129 said of the @entity0 campaign 's symbolic challenge			1
' he only agreed to one			0
' in 2002 , the last time @entity0 faced a runoff election , she debated her opponent four times in the weeks following @entity29			2
on tuesday in @entity241 , @entity14 turned the @entity1 ' challenge on its head			0
' she wants to have 6 debates , as if 6 has some significance , ' he told @entity246			0
' why not have 97 debates – one for every percent that she supports @entity249 ? or 716 for the $ 716 billion that @entity201 took out of @entity250 ? ' @entity251 reported wednesday that @entity14 's campaign operation has several advantages in addition to poll numbers			1
about 96 per cent of all the tv ads running in all six major media markets there support him			0
