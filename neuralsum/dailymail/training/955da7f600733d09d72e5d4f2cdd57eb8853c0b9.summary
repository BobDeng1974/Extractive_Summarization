a mobile payment service backed by @entity3 , @entity0 and other leading retailers is defending its practice of prohibiting its members from accepting alternatives such as @entity7			1
however , @entity8 shopped short of giving a reason for requiring exclusivity			0
the rivalry is heating up as more @entity12 choose to shop and spend time on their mobile devices			0
@entity15 , @entity16 senior vice president of internet software and services , demonstrates the new @entity7 mobile payment system at a @entity18 in @entity19			1
a consortium of retailers called @entity8 plans to offer a rival mobile payment system next year			1
@entity7 is compatible with the @entity23 , @entity24 and the @entity25			2
the mobile system works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the @entity31 button			0
this confirms the person 's identity , and the payment is simply made as if the user had presented and signed their card			0
all details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely			0
if an @entity23 is lost , users can suspend all payments via the find my @entity23 service			0
but officials say retailers may choose to leave without penalty , so they could accept those alternatives , which are based on a wireless technology called near - field communication , or @entity52			0
@entity53 and @entity54 this week joined a long list of the world 's largest retailers who will not be accepting @entity7			1
at its launch , @entity16 boasted there are 200,000 retail stores now ready and willing to let you give them your cash using just a flick of your @entity23 and a tap of your finger to prove your identity			0
but retail giants @entity3 , @entity69 , @entity70 's			2
@entity71 are not among them			0
these retail giants and dozens more are part of a group developing their own mobile payment scheme			1
' merchants make their own choices about their commitment to @entity79 and make their own choices about other forms of payment , ' said @entity83 , the group 's ceo			1
however , an @entity79 blog post earlier said that when merchants choose @entity79 , ' they choose to do so exclusively			0
' @entity79 is testing its @entity89 system and plans to launch it in 2015			1
the service has garnered criticism as some of the group 's biggest members , including @entity53 , @entity95 , @entity0 and @entity3 , are refusing @entity52 payments even though their stores have the equipment			1
@entity79 was also the target of a hack			0
in wednesday 's call , @entity79 said a small number of email addresses were obtained in a breach , but no other identifying information or any financial information was obtained			1
the @entity108 app itself was not affected , and the organization has contacted everyone whose email address was affected			2
the @entity7 service can store @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity116 credit card information			2
@entity16 said shops like @entity125 and @entity126 , drugstores including @entity118 's and @entity119 , and other stores including @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity18 are participating in @entity7			2
when @entity7 launched on oct. 20 , retailer resistance had been expected because @entity16 has n't offered incentives to install new point - of - sale terminals and train staff on its new mobile payment system			1
but this week it became clear that many large retailers declined to accept @entity7 because they were part of @entity79 , which requires exclusivity			1
on monday , @entity16 ceo @entity135 said @entity136 had over 1 million activations in the first three days after it became available and is now more widely used than any competing payment system			1
he called the dispute with retailers a ' skirmish			0
' drugstore chains @entity53 and @entity54 both last week stopped customers using the new service which lets users pay for goods by holding a smartphone close to a specially designed terminal			0
but mr @entity135 said there were plenty of other retailers around the world signing up , claiming @entity7 already totes up more transactions than all other ' contactless ' payment methods combined			1
@entity83 said it was ' entirely possible ' that in the future merchants can accept both @entity79 and the other forms of mobile payments , although did not give a timeline for when that might occur			2
@entity108 lets users pay through a checking account , a store - brand card or a gift card , in addition to regular credit and debit cards			0
in that sense , it is different than @entity7 , which lets users pay only through credit and debit cards			0
merchants save transaction fees when customers use something other than a credit or debit card			0
@entity83 said @entity79 was in talks with other ' substantial financial institutions ' and said ' over time we expect all cards will be welcome at @entity108			1
' officials said that @entity79 , which uses barcode technology , also might expand to include @entity52 , which @entity7 uses , if it deems that necessary in the future			1
there are more than 200,000 payment terminals that should accept @entity7 in the @entity12 @entity16 has announced about two dozen leading retail chains accepting @entity7 at launch , and others are planning to do so by the end of the year			1
@entity16 said it has worked with several retailers to make sure most of their stores , if not all of them , were ready at monday 's launch : @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity126 's , @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 retail stores including @entity201 , @entity203 , @entity119 , @entity204 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity204 , @entity204 , @entity125 , @entity121 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , run by @entity204 , six : 02 , @entity212 , @entity123 , @entity198 , unleashed by @entity209 , @entity118 , @entity213 and @entity214			2
bright side : dozens of retailers will be accepting @entity7 , the biggest of which include @entity123 , @entity218 , @entity118 , @entity121 and @entity125 's @entity16 also said that the following merchants plan to add support by the end of the year : @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity122 , @entity224 and @entity225			1
for online payments , @entity16 said the following merchants have apps ready for @entity7 : @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity208 , @entity236 , @entity122 , @entity69 and @entity237			0
others expected by year 's end include : @entity239 , @entity203 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 by @entity243 , @entity223 , @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247			0
of course , @entity16 's retail stores and the @entity250 app will also take @entity7 .			2
