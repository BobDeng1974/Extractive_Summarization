by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 25 august 2012 updated : 16:00 est , 25 august 2012 dupuytren 's contracture : @entity2 cricket correspondent @entity0 has had eight operations to his hand despite eight operations , the @entity2 ’s ‘ @entity8 ’ , @entity0 , remains plagued by a crippling condition of the fingers that , untreated , could have led to amputation			1
‘ @entity0 ’ , 52 , is a sufferer of @entity11 ’s contracture , in which the fingers gradually curl over into a claw - like state			1
here he talks about this progressive condition			2
if tv viewers look carefully at my right hand holding the microphone , they will see that my little finger is bent over at an extraordinary angle , and my index finger is curling inward			1
this is the visible sign of my @entity11 ’s contracture , which is named after baron @entity11 , the surgeon who first described an operation to correct the affliction in 1831			1
if i had n’t had eight operations to date , my hands could now be virtually useless			2
recently , i was in my local pub in @entity28 and , as i left , i reached out to shake the hand of the publican , @entity31 , when i realised one of his hands was entirely curled in on itself			1
this is what happens if you do not treat @entity11 ’s – the hand gradually contracts until it is little better than a claw			1
in some sufferers , amputation is the only relief			2
while @entity11 ’s is not a painful condition , it seriously affects the quality of your life			1
i can no longer play the piano , which i love , and i am very conscious of it as i have to shake so many hands as a @entity2 cricket commentator			2
undoubtedly , playing cricket ( i played county cricket for @entity28 from 1979 to 1990 and have three @entity56 caps ) has played a major part in my getting @entity11 ’s , owing to the repeated thumps of the ball into my hands			1
quite a few cricketers have it , including @entity62 and @entity63			0
most sufferers have a genetic predisposition , and i have traced it to my mother ’s side of the family : i have a first cousin who also suffers from @entity11 ’s			1
i first noticed the symptoms when i was 40 – a bobble formed in the middle of the palm of my right hand			1
my sister - in - law , who is a gp , diagnosed it			0
as the bobble hardened and began to spread into a cord - like band heading up into my little finger , the finger began to curl irretrievably towards my palm			0
it was very uncomfortable and performing small , everyday tasks became problematic			0
cause : the former professional cricketer , pictured commentating a game with former @entity56 captain @entity86 , say the years playing the game has has played a major part in getting @entity11 's with @entity11 ’s , the connective tissue under the skin of the hand starts to harden and contract , creating a rope - like band that pulls the fingers inwards			1
no one really knows what causes it			0
it is n’t life - threatening , but it certainly affects the quality of your life – all of us need our hands for everything we do			0
i began to worry about the effect on my career			0
as a journalist , how would i type ? and even simple things such as turning the handle on a door have become problematic and frustrating			0
i had my first operation when i was 40 , with a marvellous surgeon @entity114 at a private clinic in @entity28			0
i ’ve since had surgery at the @entity117 in @entity118 under @entity119			0
the tightening connective tissue was cut , releasing the finger , and the relief is immediate			1
but i had to have my hands bandaged for some time afterwards			0
@entity0 's struggle : his condition has been his biggest test as a journalist and commentator i thought this might sort the problem out , but then i noticed the fingers on my left hand were affected , too			1
in the more recent operations , they have cut away more deeply at the scar tissue			1
but the biggest problem remains with my little finger on my right hand which , despite the numerous operations , is bent at a 45 - degree angle			2
it makes me feel extremely self - conscious , and the drastic solution would be to have it amputated , but i really do n’t want to do that			0
this would make it very hard for me to grip anything – as it is , i can not perform simple tasks , such as rubbing suncream on to my wife ’s back or drying myself after a shower			2
i have also tried wearing splints on my hands to try to straighten the fingers , but as you can imagine , this is also disabling and makes getting about awkward			2
so far , i have managed not to let the condition affect my work , but it is a concern and i know i am going to have to have further treatment			0
as i am reluctant to have more surgery , i ’m looking at the new , non-invasive treatments becoming available			0
at the moment , when i shake hands with people i can see them , if not actually recoil , look down at my hands			0
this contracting tissue is also now wrapping itself around my index finger , and i need to have that sorted out			2
it is n’t the kind of condition you can just leave , as it will become worse and worse			0
it feels as if i have a tight elastic band under my skin , which is always constricting			2
i ’m thankful that i still have my grip in both hands , but if i do n’t have further treatment i could potentially lose that			0
physiotherapy does n’t help , as the problem lies under the skin , and it becomes physically impossible to straighten your fingers			1
about two million people in the @entity187 suffer from this condition , so i am keen to encourage more to have @entity11 ’s treated as soon as symptoms first emerge , because the longer you leave it , the more scar tissue forms and the more likely you are to lose mobility in the hand			1
amputation is the most extreme treatment , but it can be necessary if all else fails			0
@entity0 was talking to @entity198 .			1
