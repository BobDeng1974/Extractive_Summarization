on the run : @entity1 ditched his son , 10 , who is fighting cancer , and a 14 - year - old @entity5 daughter , to flee @entity6 a @entity6 father - of - four has been dubbed the ' world 's worst dad ' after he ' abandoned ' his children for a new life in the @entity12			1
@entity1 ditched his ten - year - old cancer sufferer son @entity13 , daughters @entity14 , 14 , who has @entity5 and @entity16 , 17 , who is fighting depression , and his eldest boy , a 19 - year - old drug addict			1
the 53 - year - old education software expert said a court ruling which made him pay $ 4,000 a month to his ex-wife in child support would financially ruin him			1
and so , with extensive work contacts in @entity26 , he sent his former love @entity27 an email saying he had left the country for good			1
he wrote on november 2 , 2011 : ' the result of the legal instrument you recently designed and implemented is there 's no possibility of a comfortable life or ( secure ) retirement for me in @entity6 at all			1
' therefore i have left the country to seek greener pastures elsewhere , and will never return			1
' it saw him join the legion of 120,000 parents in @entity47 wanted for being in arrears on spousal and child support payments			1
speaking to thestar.com from his new @entity53 home , he said he blamed a ' broken ' @entity54 that ' forced him to cut and run '			2
he said : ' i did a terrible , awful thing , because i had no reasonable option			2
i miss my children terribly			2
i abandoned @entity6 , but not my children			2
' my hope is some day i reconcile with my children , but not in @entity6 , a morally bankrupt state			2
the @entity12 is about as far as i could go			2
if i 'd a spaceship i â€™d be much further away			2
' he said his children were ' innocent bystanders who got caught in the crossfire ' and added that it was ' not my intention to hurt them '			2
he also revealed he would ' never , ever , ever , ever ' pay spousal support nor return to @entity6			0
it is a blow for his ex-wife , who has spent eight months trying to get @entity47 's @entity69 to find him			0
she told thestar.com : ' financially , emotionally , physically , and spiritually , i am approaching bankruptcy			0
if i go down , the kids go down , and i ca n't let that happen			0
' abandoned by their father : @entity27 with three of her children ( left to right ) @entity13 , 10 , @entity14 , 14 , and 17 - year - old @entity16 the trouble began when the couple split in 2005			1
after a two - day trial , they agreed mrs @entity27 would have sole custody of the children and stay in the $ 1.2million @entity47 house			0
he would pay child support , and she would pay $ 175,000 to buy him out of the house , which had a $ 600,000 mortage on it			0
she would also receive $ 2,000 a month in rent from a separate flat			0
but @entity27 later said she was ' rushed and pressured and did not read ' before signing , and that she did not understand she would never receive any future spousal support			0
mr @entity1 said : ' @entity27 got the million dollar lakefront mansion and full custody of the children with child support , but no spousal support , in exchange for the house			1
' everyone at the time agreed that my spousal support obligation had been met fully			0
' the feud grew for several years until a new trial was scheduled for autumn 2011 after mr @entity1 had reportedly tried to take his ex-wife to court three times			1
she decided to use it as an opportunity to ask a court to grant her spousal support			1
this was granted before the trial when , in june 2011 , a judge issued a temporary order for the payments			0
happier times : @entity1 and @entity27 with all four of their children before they separated in 2005 he also awarded her retrospective payments and court costs			1
mr @entity1 left the country before the trial could take place			1
he now lives in @entity127 , 30 miles south of @entity53 , with his new wife , former caregiver @entity128			0
he has since said his fleeing was a ' purely tactical response to an untenable situation ' and accused his ex of using their son @entity13 's cancer as a ' weapon ' against him			1
he said that , as far as he knew , the disease was ' in check ' and that their eldest son , who is being treated on a methadone programme , was now an adult and so not a dependent			1
and he said that he was not ' in greener pastures ' by saying : ' i live in the @entity12 for @entity146 's sake			0
' this is not a country club			0
i have to keep a loaded shotgun beside my bed at night in case of attack , of which there have been several			0
' former teacher @entity155 , a @entity156 immigrant with both a @entity6 and @entity158 passport , in the meantime said she can not work because of her ' onerous ' family responsibilities			0
and the situation looks unlikely to change as the @entity12 is beyond the reach of @entity6 laws , even though he owes $ 28,000 arrears and his debt is growing by $ 3,772 per month			0
escape : @entity1 is now living near @entity53 , @entity12 , after leaving @entity6 ditched : @entity1 left his family home near @entity47 , @entity6 , for a new life in @entity26			1
