wrongful arrest : @entity6 , 47 , was dragged out of his car for driving too slowly outside @entity15 while his partner @entity18 watched mr @entity6 , from @entity19 , was stopped because he was not driving quickly enough as he waited for his partner @entity20 , 40 , to catch up in another car as he collected his son			1

but a jury at @entity42 ruled there had been no justification for detaining him			0
mr @entity6 said : ' as soon as the @entity24 officers came over they seemed to have adopted an aggressive , bullying attitude and started searching the car and pushing me around before they threw me to the floor			1
detained : mr @entity6 was driving slowly in the arrivals area waiting for his partner to catch up when he was arrested battle : mr @entity6 was arrested in 2009 and has now won a four - year legal fight for compensation ' they never explained to me that i 'd been arrested and they just locked me up , then a few hours later they released me without any explanation			1
i knew what had happened was n't right and that night i decided i was going to fight it			0
' i 'm just a normal person and for four years this has always been at the back of my mind and caused me a lot of stress but it was something i did n't want to just let go , because they abused their power and like anyone else the police need to be held to account			2
' mr @entity6 was collecting his son , @entity77 , and the 23 - year - old 's @entity79 car as he was unable to drive himself home after suffering head injuries , a broken wrist and broken collarbone in a motoring accident while on holiday in @entity86			2
