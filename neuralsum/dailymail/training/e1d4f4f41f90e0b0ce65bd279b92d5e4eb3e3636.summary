@entity0 has been used as a no 10 by @entity2 but @entity3 put him on the wing against @entity5 where he made his name			1
you ca n't blame @entity3 , for all @entity0 's talent he had n't scored in his last 19 games for club and country , hardly convincing evidence he deserves a more central role			2
@entity0 , who turned 20 on monday , has lost a bit of confidence and earned groans from the @entity17 after a poor touch ended a swift break			0
@entity0 played out on the wing , but failed to show he was worthy of a more prominent central role @entity0 sits dejected on the @entity23 turf during a match which saw @entity26 crash out of the competition @entity0 attempts to tackle @entity5 's @entity28 during the match at @entity23 on tuesday night there were as many @entity32 signings in @entity26 's starting line - up as those by current boss @entity3			1
@entity32 , who took the club to two @entity37 finals , bought @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity0 and @entity40 ; the @entity3 quartet were @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity45 @entity44			2
the remaining three starters were @entity47 and @entity48 , both signed by @entity50 , and homegrown @entity51			0
there were as many @entity32 ( right ) signings in the @entity26 team as there were @entity3 ' it was a typically passionate @entity58 goal celebration at @entity23 - from the away end			1
@entity5 fans have a reputation for being the only ones in @entity63 who ' get football ' like we do and @entity68 's excellent 25th minute strike was greeted with noise , colour and even a smoke bomb to add to the atmosphere			1
their non-stop chanting was in contrast to the @entity17 who were strangely quick to turn on their side in a disappointing first half			0
the @entity5 fans were in fine voice ( pictured ) but the same could not be said of the home support @entity5 manager @entity81 has the dubious distinction of being sacked by two championship clubs and leaving a third by mutual consent			1
but maybe the 44 - year - old former @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity88 manager has found his right level in the @entity37			0
the @entity90 also has an ' @entity92 ' lucky charm - goalscorer @entity68 has now netted at @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity23			0
@entity81 has been sacked by two championship clubs , but guided @entity5 through to the knockout stages			0

@entity0 failed to impress in a wide role for @entity26 on tuesday
@entity32 was *responsible* for four of @entity26 's starting *xi*
the @entity5 fans were above and beyond the home support at @entity23
@entity81 may have found his level at the @entity63 club
