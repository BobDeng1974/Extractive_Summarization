by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob there is little doubt that the watching world will be in awe when @entity5 take to the field against @entity7 in @entity8 in less than two weeks			0
the @entity9 is an architectural gem in the modern style of football stadia , a design which creates the illusion that an elegant spaceship has landed in the jungle town			0
@entity17 is collected in the roof to irrigate the pitch ; the over- arching structure is specially built to ventilate the crowd			0
the 44,500 , all - seater stadium will be a fitting venue for @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 and for three further @entity29 fixtures			1
carnival or chaos ? social unrest could rear it 's head should @entity32 become unsettled during the @entity29 @entity36 : the @entity9 in @entity8 , home of @entity5 v @entity7 , could be redundant after @entity29 and then it will cease to have a sensible purpose			1
three workers died constructing a stadium that is essentially a vanity project for local politicians and which cost £ 171milion - some £ 40m over budget			2
when @entity5 depart and the @entity29 circus moves on , the stadium will be taken over by local club side @entity47			1
their average attendance is 1,963			0
those facts explain the social uprising that threatens to envelop @entity32 this month			1
for the @entity54 organising committee and the @entity32 government , with a little help from @entity52 , have done something truly extraordinary : they have turned a nation more obsessed with its national team than any other into opponents of the @entity29			1
the most recent opinion poll has 48 per cent of @entity32 supportive of the tournament , down from 78 per cent in 2008			1
@entity63 : ' @entity65 traitor			0
you are who deserves a beating '			0
vociferous : masked demonstrators burn a @entity32 national flag during a protest against the tournament vociferous : ( @entity76 left ) ' we want schools , metros , trains buses , ferries and hospitals at @entity52 quality '			1
‘ never before has the @entity29 incited these feelings of hatred among @entity32 , ’ said @entity84 , a prominent @entity32 film - maker and football fan			1
he seems to speak for many , judging by huge street protests that accompanied last year ’s confederations cup - demonstrations initially provoked by a hike in bus fares			1
@entity92 , star of @entity32 ’s 1994 @entity29 - winning team and now a socialist politician in the @entity95 of deputies , the lower house in @entity98 , calls the tournament ‘ the biggest heist in the history of @entity32 ’			1
it is not just the delays , the cost and the futility of the stadia that is so abhorrent this time			2
we are used to obsolete arenas being abandoned after tournaments			0
probe some of the extravagance a little more closely and the reason for the deep anger on the streets becomes evident			0
the @entity114 in @entity115 cost £ 375m to build , well over budget and making the @entity8 project seem positively frugal			0
a 141 - page report by the city ’s auditors has found ‘ grave irregularities ’ in the budget , which appears to indicate over-pricing of some materials			0
‘ the country of football is reacting to the waste , the unfinished infrastructure projects , the allegations of corruption , the poor quality of schools and hospitals , the poor use of resources , ’ said @entity125 , a former finance minister of @entity32			1
pricey : police protect the £ 375million @entity114 in @entity115 some @entity52 officials know the era of the major tournament has become corrupted to the point at which it is in danger of becoming obsolete , swept away like a tired old regime in a storm of social protest			2
but @entity149 , standing again for the presidency three years after he promised to retire following this term , does not appear to be among that group			0
and as @entity52 has settled on @entity153 2018 and @entity154 for the next tournaments , we need not expect reform any time soon			0
there is a contradiction within all of this , of course			0
many professional observers of @entity32 are convinced that once the tournament begins , social tensions will ease and a nation that is so obsessed with its team will largely rally round			1
even the most committed opponent of the @entity29 will find it hard to hold back the wave of enthusiasm that surrounds a successful @entity32 side			1
however , this is based on the assumption that @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and their team - mates perform			2
most agree that a disappointing performance will re-ignite the fires of social protest			0
the @entity29 may yet reach a happy conclusion			2
there will doubtless be plenty to admire in @entity32 , on and off the pitch , although most of it will be in spite of , rather than because of , the organisers ’ best efforts			2
but when a country that is popularly defined by carnival and football can find little to celebrate in hosting the @entity29 , even the most hardened @entity52 executives must recognise that , without change , this celebration of football will one day cease to have a meaningful purpose			2
@entity199 ask : @entity32 's poster boy @entity174 is under pressure to deliver the trophy that will unite the country figurehead : @entity52 president @entity149 is to stand for re-election despite insisting that he would n't			1

protests and social unrest in @entity32 set to threaten the @entity29
many *people* *unhappy* over cost of staging the tournament
@entity32 *players* such as @entity174 under huge pressure to deliver
many convinced that success for the home nation will calm tensions
