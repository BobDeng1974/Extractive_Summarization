@entity1 warplanes and artillery began pounding @entity3 this morning as 30,000 troops and irregulars prepared to attack the city , a stronghold of the @entity9 insurgency			1
the operation in the birthplace of former dictator @entity12 was announced last night by @entity1 's prime minister , who urged soldiers and government - backed @entity16 militias to spare civilians			1
speaking from @entity20 , the other main city in @entity22 province , @entity19 appeared to be addressing fears of reprisals against the @entity3 area 's mainly @entity26 population			1
it is feared the mainly @entity16 forces of the @entity1 government could attack the area 's mainly @entity26 population , worsening sectarian divisions on social media , mr @entity19 called ' for utmost care in protecting civilian lives and property ' in the city , which was last year the scene of a brutal massacre of hundreds of mainly @entity16 @entity1 army recruits			1
government forces have been working their way north in recent months , notching up key victories against @entity79			0
but @entity3 , which has resisted them several times , is their toughest target yet			0
' security forces are advancing on three main fronts towards @entity3 , @entity85 ( to the south ) and @entity87 ( to the north ) , ' a senior army officer on the ground told @entity91 by telephone			1
the army officer said the forces involved in the battle were from the army , police , counter-terrorism units , a government - controlled volunteer group known as the @entity102 units and local @entity26 tribes opposed to @entity79			0
' the attack is being carried out using fighter jets , helicopters and artillery targeting @entity3 to secure the advance and cut supply routes , ' he said			2
military sources said @entity1 warplanes were involved but it was not immediately clear whether foreign air support - @entity113 or from the @entity116 - led coalition fighting is - was also called in			0
according to both @entity1 and @entity113 media , @entity118 - supremo of the elite @entity113 @entity120 force , specialising in ' subversive warfare ' - was in @entity22 province to help coordinate operations			0
@entity125 : @entity127 and volunteer fighters prepare at @entity129 region before moving into @entity3 good morale : @entity1 forces have notched up key victories against @entity79 as they 've inched north in recent weeks religion : a soldier walks past a line of armoured cars , one of which has a photo of a cleric in the window cavalry : @entity1 armoured personnel carriers are lined up ahead of the attack on @entity3 today @entity3 would be the biggest victory yet for @entity1 forces battling @entity9 , but the attack by thousands of @entity16 irregulars could severely test the government 's ability to handle sectarian divisions			1
@entity1 is bitterly split between minority sunnis , who were an important base of support for @entity12 , despite his regime 's nominal secularism , and the @entity16 majority			2
since the @entity9 insurgency began , the @entity1 military is heavily dependent on @entity16 militias that have been accused of abusing @entity26 communities elsewhere in @entity1			1
' the priority we gave to the armed forces and all the forces taking part alongside them is to preserve the security of citizens , ' mr @entity19 said last night			0
@entity168 , the @entity102 commander , appealed to @entity3 residents on saturday to leave their homes within 48 hours so government forces could ' wrap up the battle of the revenge for @entity174			0
' @entity174 is a military base near @entity3 from which hundreds of new , mostly @entity16 , recruits were kidnapped before being executed last summer , as the @entity9 insurgency took control of much of @entity1 's @entity26 @entity179 heartland			1
@entity16 militias in particular have vowed to avenge the @entity174 executions , sparking fears of mass killings against @entity26 if @entity3 were to be recaptured			2
mr @entity19 appealed to residents to turn against the jihadists , who have suffered a string of military losses since a @entity116 - led coalition of @entity190 and @entity179 nations stepped up their support for @entity1 's embattled government			2
' i call on all those who were misled and made mistakes in the past to lay down their arms today			0
this may be the last chance , ' mr @entity19 said , suggesting some could be granted amnesty			0
@entity1 forces tried and failed several times to wrest back @entity3 , a @entity26 @entity179 city on the @entity202 around 100 miles north of @entity44			1
ready : a wide view shows @entity1 soldiers and @entity16 irregulars massing at the @entity207 dam			2
@entity3 would be the biggest victory yet for @entity1 forces battling @entity9 taking a moment : an @entity1 soldier rests on a wall at the @entity207 dam			1
an army officer said the forces involved in the battle were from the army , police , counter-terrorism units , volunteer units and local tribes armed : troops wander the streets around @entity207 dam while they wait for the order to attack			0
the arrival of many thousands of @entity16 fighters in the mainly @entity26 city of @entity3 risks inflaming sectarian divisions last phone call ? a soldier chats on his mobile phone as columns of vehicles move past on their way to attack the military commander for @entity22 province , @entity235 , said @entity3 had both symbolic and strategic importance			1
' the aim of course is to liberate @entity239 to allow for the return of displaced families but it is also going to be a stepping stone on the way to liberating @entity57 , ' he told @entity91			0
@entity3 is the hometown of executed dictator @entity12 , the remnants of whose @entity245 have collaborated with is in attempting to topple the @entity16 - dominated government			2
