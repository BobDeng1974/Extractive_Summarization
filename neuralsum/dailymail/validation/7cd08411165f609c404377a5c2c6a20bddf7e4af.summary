no audience with @entity1 is complete without a mention of the @entity4 ’s ‘ philo - sophy ’			1
he talked about it on his first day at @entity6 and was still talking about it in the build - up to @entity10 ’s win over @entity11 on sunday			1
‘ it takes time , ’ he said			2
‘ in @entity14 ( at @entity15 ) , it took until december			2
and now ( with @entity10 ) until march			1
’ there were signs all over the pitch at @entity19 that his players are finally getting the message			1
it was without doubt their best performance under @entity23 : ‘ one of the most important moments in my career , ’ he later acknowledged			2
@entity10 playmaker @entity27 stole the show at @entity19 as he netted a brace against @entity11 @entity27 ( left ) and fellow countryman @entity30 ( right ) impressed against @entity10 's arch - rivals @entity32 uploaded a dressing room photograph of @entity10 's post-match celebrations @entity10 are currently fourth in the @entity35 the 63 - year - old is ruthless in his pursuit of what he wants			1
no - one is exempt , and it was significant that @entity27 and @entity30 , two of @entity10 ’s best performers in the 2 - 1 win over their bitter rivals , have been made to sit on the sidelines for lengthy spells this season			1
two - goal hero @entity27 only returned against @entity48 in the previous game after a two - month absence from @entity23 ’s starting line - up in the @entity35			1
his position at @entity19 , described by @entity23 as a ‘ false right winger ’ , demonstrated once again how the manager places his team ’s needs above an individual ’s preference			1
and @entity30 spoke candidly on monday about how upsetting @entity23 contributed to him making just six league starts in his first six months at @entity6 following a £ 29million move from @entity61			1
‘ i keep my distance with @entity23 , but he ’s a good guy with a strong character , ’ said @entity30 , who was not seen for more than a month after being hooked at half - time against @entity63 in october			1
@entity10 's first team stars finally appear to be buying in @entity1 's philosophy @entity27 was given a free role against @entity11 in december ( left ) but performed admirably as a ' false winger ' at @entity19 on sunday ( right ) ‘ he likes discipline and does not believe in egos in the dressing room			1
everybody is equal under his rule			2
he talks about what he wants from me			2
at the start he used to tell me off because i always looked for the ball			0
i always wanted to have it , and no , i must wait			0
‘ he loves possession and he does n’t like being at risk of losing the ball			0
he wants long stretches of possession			0
he believes spaces are created that way because the team has the quality to find them			0
’ there have been many times in @entity23 ’s first season in @entity92 when his philosophy has not been altogether clear ; when the constant chopping and changing of formation and shuffling of a rather expensive pack of players has left fans scratching their heads			0
nor are united close to being the finished article			0
an eight - point deficit on @entity103 is evidence of that , and they are still far from certain to achieve their target of @entity110 qualification despite sunday ’s win opening up a five - point advantage over @entity11			1
but something seems to have clicked in the wins against @entity48 and @entity11 , just when the @entity116 defeat by @entity117 looked to have raised major concerns over the club ’s direction under @entity23			1
players who privately have questioned his methods look more comfortable , although @entity11 ’s alarmingly lacklustre display at @entity19 helped in that respect			1
@entity10 midfielder @entity126 has been in impressive form since his return from injury @entity130 , pictured with @entity23 , is showing his best form since joining @entity10 in september 2013 @entity126 ’s return to anchor the midfield has been an important factor , so too @entity130 ’s advanced role , which has given @entity10 ’s attack a new dimension			1
even @entity138 and @entity139 , @entity10 ’s much - maligned @entity92 centre backs , look solid after being thrown back together by @entity142 ’s groin injury and @entity144 ’s ban for spitting at @entity146 ’s @entity145			1
surprisingly , @entity139 and @entity138 have only started as a central defensive pairing on five occasions in the league , not including four games together as part of @entity23 ’s unpopular back three			0
and @entity139 admitted that the expectations raised by succeeding @entity153 and @entity154 have not made it easy for them			0
‘ it has been difficult , ’ he said			0
‘ it was well documented that me and @entity138 were going to be the next centre backs at @entity10 but it has not gone how we would have liked			2
‘ you can not build a partnership on four games			0
hopefully now we have had back - to - back games together we can keep it going			2
we complement each other well			0
’ @entity139 ( centre ) has admitted he has struggled to fill the boots left by @entity153 and @entity154 it was also notable that @entity10 ’s best 45 minutes of the season , according to @entity23 , came with @entity170 and @entity171 on the bench			2
both came on to play their part in the victory and it was a reminder of the resources at his disposal , as well as the issues that still need to be ironed out in the remaining months of the season			0
‘ those boys are top players but we have a number of players who the manager can choose from , which is great , ’ said @entity126			0
‘ different games throw up different scenarios and different systems maybe , but the last two games have gone very well for us			0
’ there is still room for improvement , but it appears @entity23 ’s philosophy is beginning to sink in .			0

@entity27 starred in @entity10 's 2 - 1 win against @entity11
the @entity197 netted a brace at @entity19 to help @entity10 claim all three points
@entity1 has said he has been *deploying* @entity27 as a ' false winger '
@entity30 has also managed to retain starting spot in recent weeks
