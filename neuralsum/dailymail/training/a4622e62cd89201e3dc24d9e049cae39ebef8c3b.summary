by @entity0 published : 11:22 est , 16 may 2012 updated : 18:08 est , 17 may 2012 @entity1 gave the economy a huge boost yesterday when its car workers were judged to be more efficient , hard - working and flexible than their counterparts in a @entity8 wrestling with the euro - crisis			1
the verdict came from @entity12 parent company @entity11 as it saved @entity1 ’s @entity14 factory in @entity15 from closure and made it the lead plant in @entity18 to manufacture the next generation @entity20 from 2015			1
it means £ 125million of new investment and 700 extra jobs on top of the 2,100 already secured			0
driving forward : @entity12 bosses at @entity1 's @entity12 parent company @entity11 judged that @entity28 workers are more flexible , competitive and efficient - and less militant - than their counterparts in @entity8 with the @entity28 enjoying a car exports boom , up to 3,000 more jobs at suppliers could be generated as @entity1 raises the amount of @entity28 - sourced components in the @entity20			1
the plant will build the five - door @entity20 hatchback plus one variant – either the @entity39 estate or the sporty @entity40 – with production soaring from 140,000 a year now to 160,000 and up to a capacity of 225,000			1
@entity1 beat @entity8 counterparts thanks to a ‘ ground - breaking ’ round - the - clock flexibility deal			1
busy : production at the @entity14 factory is to soar from the current 140,000 cars a year to 225,000 it spells extra shifts , weekend working and the end of the ‘ traditional ’ long summer shutdown as well as a two - year pay freeze from 2013 followed by two years of real terms increases of @entity56 inflation plus 1 per cent			1
the move was hailed by the prime minister , business leaders and unions as ‘ a vote of confidence ’ in @entity28 workers and the economy			2
it marks the latest triumph for the booming @entity28 motor industry which for the first time since 1976 is exporting more cars than it imports			0
@entity70 praised the ‘ team effort ’ of employees , unions , managers and ministers in keeping production in the @entity28			0
working for @entity28 : the announcement will be made today at an event attended by business secretary @entity78 ( pictured ) business secretary @entity78 , who flew to @entity79 in march to put the case for @entity1 to @entity11 bosses , said it was ‘ fantastic news ’			2
he added : ‘ the fact that big @entity12 car companies are making big investments in @entity28 is a good signal			2
’ @entity1 bosses called it ‘ a historic day ’			0
the good news came as motor industry figures showed a near 10 per cent rise in the number of cars built in @entity28 in april compared with a year ago			0
the figures were boosted by strong export demand for the likes of @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104			0
the turnaround follows significant car industry investment in the @entity28 topping £ 4billion in 18 months			0
the @entity11 decision on @entity14 means the plant will be exporting astras to @entity8 where production of the best - selling small family car will cease altogether			1
that marks the death - knell for @entity11 ’s @entity8 factory in @entity115 – employing up to 3,200 people – which was competing with the @entity28 plant			1
@entity14 and @entity118 in @entity119 will now become the only two manufacturing centres for the @entity20			0
the deal also turns on its head the notion that @entity28 plants are first in line for closure because their ‘ flexibility ’ means they are easier and cheaper to shut than those in @entity8 where the cost of laying off workers is significantly more expensive .			2

announcement ends months of nail - *biting* over future of @entity15 plant
@entity1 's @entity12 owners are to close factory in @entity8 with loss of *thousands* of jobs after backing @entity28 site
@entity28 workers found to be more flexible , competitive and efficient than @entity8 counterparts
production at the @entity14 factory is to soar from the current 140,000 cars a year to 225,000
