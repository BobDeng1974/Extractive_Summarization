by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor buying a home in @entity3 would be cheaper than in @entity4 under @entity5 plans to axe stamp duty on properties worth up to £ 250,000			1
conservatives in @entity3 will today announce a policy to axe the 1 per cent levy , warning stamp duty pushes home ownership ‘ dream further away ’ for thousands of would - be first - time buyers			1
the move will heap pressure on chancellor @entity17 to promise to do the same in @entity4 , or risk making it more costly to buy a home on different sides of the border			1
under the plan drawn up by @entity26 , the cost of buying a home in @entity3 would be higher than in @entity4 in an attempt to attract buyers to cross the border mr @entity17 has used taxpayers money to guarantee billions of pounds in state - backed mortgages under the controversial help to buy scheme , to help people who only have a five per cent deposit to buy a home			1
but @entity38 in @entity3 want to go further , and propose using new powers devolved to @entity40 to cut stamp duty levied on properties worth between £ 125,000 and £ 250,000			1
writing for @entity42 , @entity38 leader said : ‘ for many without the @entity47 or who already pay expensive rents prohibiting saving , the costs of that initial leap onto the ladder remain unreachable			2
‘ stamp duty pushes that dream further away			1
on average for a 10 per cent deposit , stamp duty is equivalent to 3 per cent on top			1
’ the policy to scrap stamp duty in @entity3 would cost around £ 20million , but to be replicated across @entity4 would cost hundreds of millions of pounds			1
the move would make it much cheaper for people trying to get their foot on the first run of the property ladder , at a time when values are soaring			0
mr @entity17 warned this week that the house price boom would last for another decade , with demand outstripping supply			2
house prices in @entity3 were up by 5.4 per cent in november , 11.6 per cent in @entity70 , 4.5 per cent in the @entity71 and 4.4 per cent in the @entity72 chancellor @entity17 warned demand for homes would significantly outstrip supply for at least another 10 years prices in @entity3 are up more than 5 per cent , slightly lower than the average in @entity4 but well ahead of @entity78 , @entity79 and the @entity80			1
mr @entity42 added : ‘ we want to make @entity3 a nation of home owners and a place of low tax and this is just one of the ways we can get there			0
’ the @entity38 are the second largest party in the @entity89 , and the policy will almost certainly lead to calls for @entity92 to follow suit			2
when the @entity38 called for a stamp duty ‘ holiday ’ for first - time buyers before the 2010 election , then - @entity92 chancellor @entity94 quickly copied the policy			1
moves to devolve tax powers to @entity40 make it possible for the first time that stamp duty rates could differ between @entity4 and @entity3			1
the @entity105 , which would hand control of stamp duty to assembly members , is expected to pass into law this year			1
by @entity110 , @entity111 @entity42 , @entity5 leader in @entity3 , claims the stamp duty cut could revitalise @entity3 the property - owning democracy was one of @entity117 ’s lasting legacies			1
in today ’s @entity3 of lower than @entity120 average salaries and expensive rental markets ; this legacy is becoming less and less of a possibility for many			0
last year , there were 13,000 house sales in the stamp duty bracket - £ 125,000 to £ 250,000			1
with house prices on the rise again , houses that fall in this bracket are no longer for the wealthy but for our aspirational and those wanting to get onto the property ladder			0
this dream has become more of a reality with the increase in 5 per cent deposit mortgage offers and shared equity schemes , following the impressive lead of the @entity139			0
however , for many without the @entity47 or who already pay expensive rents prohibiting saving , the costs of that initial leap onto the ladder remain unreachable			0
stamp duty pushes that dream further away			1
on average for a 10 per cent deposit , stamp duty is equivalent to 3 per cent on top			2
therefore , the @entity38 are today pledging to abolish stamp duty on all property in @entity3 up to a value of £ 250,000			1
we want to make @entity3 a nation of home owners and a place of low tax and this is just one of the ways we can get there			0
we would like to do this today , but we need to wait until powers are devolved			0
within the next year , the @entity105 – a @entity120 @entity139 bill which plans to devolve stamp duty to the @entity89 – will be passed , enabling @entity3 to become a low tax destination			1
since @entity38 devolution began in 1999 , @entity167 has fallen to 72 per cent of the @entity120 average and average wages and house prices lag behind other parts of the @entity120			2
all this whilst @entity92 has been at the helm of the @entity38 economy for nigh on 15 years			0
in some areas of @entity3 , builders are now turning their backs on building here because of the cost of @entity38 regulations and the lack of buoyancy in the market			0
it is inevitable that some in @entity3 will query the need for such a move , but that ’s part of the lack of imagination , not lack of possibility			0
in a report written in june last year , it was suggested that reducing stamp duty by just 1per cent can increase volumes by 20 per cent over a very short period of time			2
at present levels , abolishing this band of stamp duty would cost the @entity38 exchequer around £ 20 million			1
however , an increase in economic activity will increase tax takes			0
the @entity120 @entity139 ’s announcement to support 30 of the 31 recommendations of the @entity207 on further devolution shows the @entity38 commitment to @entity3 being a low tax country as a means to driving entrepreneurial spirit and growing a @entity38 economy that for too long has been at the bottom of the @entity120 ’s competitiveness league tables			2
last week , a leading report showed significant evidence of ‘ brain drain ’ to @entity70 and the @entity71 , with clear routes from all parts of the @entity120			0
nowhere was the route more trodden than between @entity3 and @entity70			0
we all know that the @entity120 faces huge challenges in counter-balancing the huge pull of @entity70 , yet in the case of @entity3 very few actually return			0
this requires radical policy and i believe that by sounding the horn of low tax , @entity3 could begin to reverse this decline			2
becoming a place where people believe enterprise thrives and is actively supported			0
i believe the @entity38 are the only party to do that			0
what an abolition of stamp duty would do is send a message to the strivers and the ambitious that they can be better off in @entity3			2
it wo n’t solve all problems , but nor do i pretend it will			0
sometimes in politics , small changes can make very big differences .			0

@entity38 propose axing 1 *%* stamp duty on sales of £ 125,000 - £ 250,000
claim it could attract buyers from @entity4 to reverse *exodus* of young
policy will put pressure on @entity17 to act on tax in @entity4
