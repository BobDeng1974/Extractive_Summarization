however , aware of the sensitivity around the memory of princess @entity6 she has made clear she wishes to be known as @entity9 in the same way , senior royal sources say prince @entity10 's wife is technically the @entity6 , but chooses not to go by that title again because of the sensitivities associated with @entity6			1

' @entity46 has recently impressed many with her willingness to publicise good causes and engage with the public			2
but it has n't always been the case			2
hitting the dance floor : @entity10 and @entity7 gamely showed their moves during the ' chapauringe ' dance during a visit to the @entity58 in @entity59 , the capital of @entity60			2
the couple are visiting @entity62 on an eight - day @entity64 tour a dancer placed a yellow , red and black khanga on @entity7 's shoulders but she soon had to remove in the heat @entity7 was extremely unpopular after she and @entity10 became lovers in the 1980 's while he was still married to @entity6 , the nation 's sweetheart			2
when asked to cite the cause of the marriage breakdown on @entity75 's @entity74 , @entity6 responded ' well there were three of us in this marriage , so it was a bit crowded ' referring to @entity7			0

@entity10 swayed contentedly along to a tune played on a zumari , similar to the instrument snake - charmers use			0
@entity7 was hot on his heels though and , clutching her white parasol , she swayed her hips to the music , while a @entity60 woman wrapped a yellow , red and black khanga shawl around her			0
