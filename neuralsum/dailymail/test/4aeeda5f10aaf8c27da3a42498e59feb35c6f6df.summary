having fathered 40 children by 20 different women , @entity0 has enjoyed his fair share of intimacy			1
but seemingly unsatisfied with his gaggle of offspring , scorned former lovers and being engaged for the fourth time , the 56 - year - old is showing no signs of settling down soon			1
for despite being set to marry , the alcoholic benefits claimant still has a live profile on the site where he met his bride - to - be			1
despite being engaged for the fourth time and having already fathered 40 children by 20 different women , @entity0 still has an active online dating profile offering a half - grin to the camera with his signature pony - tail tucked away from view , @entity0 tells prospective conquests : ' i love my kids , ' in a brief biography on his plenty of fish account			1
listed among his hobbies is watching tv and playing computer games - a luxury indulged by the taxpayer who footed the bill for his three 48in widescreen television sets , as revealed earlier this week			2
but while @entity0 paints himself as a doting father , one of his many children has spoken out to confirm the feeling is not mutual			1
in an interview with the @entity39 , two of his sons have revealed they wish they 'd never even come into contact with him			0
fearful that any girl he meets during a night out may be his sister , care worker @entity44 , 22 , said dramatically : ' i wish i 'd never met my dad			1
i 'd rather be related to @entity46 than to him			1
' younger brother @entity47 , 21 , said so bad was his father 's womanising , his mother once tried to stab him with a butter knife after being duped out of money to buy new motorbikes			2
' as soon as the money dried up he moved on			0
' she caught him snogging another woman in the garden and tried to stab him with a butter knife			0
' ' i wo n't stop ' : father of 40 @entity0 , left and right with his fiancée @entity63 , is said to have cost taxpayers £ 4.3million in benefits and other costs because of his huge family family : @entity0 says that he loves sex and wo n't use contraception - even though 16 of his children were taken into care the brothers also claimed their father spent the majority of his benefits payouts on alcohol and new bikes			1
earlier this week it was revealed @entity0 had cost the taxpayer an estimated £ 4million in benefits and care costs by fathering so many children			1
at least 16 have been taken off him and their mothers and placed into care			0
@entity87 costs : @entity0 says 16 of his children were taken into care			1
a placement in local authority care costs an average of £ 150,000 a year			2
if they each spent just a year in care , the bill would be £ 2.4million			2
child benefit : £ 1,000 per annum for the eldest child , plus £ 700 per year for each additional child , which would be claimed by the person looking after the child			1
assuming half his children are now adults and half are still entitled to child benefit , the bill would be at least £ 500,000			2
child tax credits would have been worth an average of £ 2,000 per year , per child if the parents were not working			2
his benefits : mr @entity0 claims he has received up to £ 27,000 a year in benefits , totalling £ 675,000			1
@entity113 : £ 4,375,000 despite not being able to recognise all of his children in the street , @entity0 is in no rush to stop reproducing			1
leaping to his defence , fiancee @entity117 , 46 , told @entity119 : ' he 's a good guy			0
he 's been unfaithful but that 's all in the past '			0
one of his youngest children , a three - year - old girl , was born after he agreed to help a childless couple have a baby			1
he said : ' i helped them by having sex with her			0
for all my sins i have done one or two things right '			0
one of his children , @entity131 , 25 , who is also unemployed , said : ' he was a p * * * head but he 's done well			2
i 'm proud , ' she told the @entity119 but mr @entity0 ’s brother , @entity134 , 59 , said the former fairground worker ’s ‘ shocking ’ behaviour had brought ‘ shame ’ on the family			1
@entity139 , from @entity140 , @entity141 , added : ‘ i lost touch with @entity0 when i moved to @entity141 18 years ago – he did n’t have a phone so we could n’t keep in touch			1
‘ it would n’t surprise me if he had 40 children , the way he carries on			1
' i ’m not ashamed of @entity150 , but i ’m upset about the way our family name has been tarnished			0
‘ he has brought shame on us , and we are a good family			0
’ his relationships have broken down because of his drinking and womanising , and the recovering alcoholic says 16 of his children have been taken into care at some stage in their lives			2
addicted : @entity0 plays on his three £ 450 @entity165 consoles for up to 20 hours a day - all paid for by benefits keeping track : mr @entity0 , from @entity168 in @entity169 , shows off his family tree tattoo - which includes his children and grandchildren if they had completed just one year in care each , it would leave the taxpayer with a bill for £ 2.4million			1
mr @entity0 or the children ’s mothers would also have been able to claim at least £ 500,000 in child benefit and a further £ 800,000 in child tax credits			1
on top of this , he has claimed at least £ 675,000 in benefits himself			2
yet the feckless dad , of @entity168 in @entity186 , said : ‘ i ’ll never stop [ having children ]			1
in the @entity189 , @entity188 says go forth and multiply			0
i ’m doing what @entity188 wants			0
' i ’m as fertile as sin			0
i do n’t believe in contraception and i love sex '			0
he was the subject of a @entity197 documentary this week , but last night former friends said @entity0 ’s claim to 40 children – aged between three and 37 – was nonsense			1
and as 40 kids by 20 women aired , his ex-wife @entity204 told of her embarrassment on @entity206 , writing : ‘ feeling @entity207 ’ ( sic )			2
mr @entity0 , who lives in a council house and claims benefits , said he was a changed man who no longer drank alcohol			2
but he still wants more children			2
‘ most of my kids have gone through the care system			0
' it makes me feel like s * * * because they ’ve suffered			0
they [ social services ] took them from me because i ’m an alcoholic			0
i ’m still an alcoholic – i just do n’t practise it			0
’ @entity223 ’ @entity222 chief executive @entity221 said : ‘ it is the lack of shame that really sticks in the throat and taxpayers will be furious			0
offspring : @entity0 admits his lifestyle led to 16 of his children being taken into care but says he wants to make it up to them ' it is sheer arrogance to keep having children as if they were hot dinners and expect other people to pick up the bill			1
’ but former friends say mr @entity0 ’s boasts are off the mark , and that he has fathered as few as 16 children with three women			1
one said he had ‘ padded ’ his numbers by including his ex-partner ’s stepchildren			0
he added : ‘ he ’s no angel after a drink but he is n’t the big ladies ’ man that he likes to think he is			0
' he ’s definitely had a football team ’s worth of little ’ uns – maybe 16 – just because he ’s not fussy and not careful			0
but no way has he got two rugby teams and all the subs to make it up to 40			0
’ mr @entity0 and his family are infamous in the former mining town of @entity168 , where locals have launched petitions to stop him moving into their street			1
he now lives with his fiancee @entity117 , ten years his junior , in a council house in the village of @entity266			0
mr @entity0 ’s daughter @entity267 , 19 , said on @entity206 yesterday : ‘ you can all hate but it does n’t matter , there ’s plenty of us to stick up for each other and we can take on the lot of you			2
‘ i feel like i ca n’t even leave my house without people judging			0
get off my back , i did n’t ask my dad to do what he ’s done with his life			0
’ dream : mr @entity0 says being reunited with his huge brood would complete him and make his life perfect day out : @entity0 and @entity63 with some of the children at their local bowling alley new life : the father - of - 40 lives with his fiancée @entity117 , ten years his junior , and they live in a two - bed council house in @entity186			1
