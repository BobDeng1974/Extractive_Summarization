on the couch with @entity1 : three days after announcing he would run for president , @entity1 and wife @entity9 hosted a small dinner party attended by friends @entity17 and @entity28 ( left and third from left ) in @entity11 @entity21 had asked to tape the party 's after - dinner conversation as part of research for his next book			1
after initial fumblings with the tape recorder - with @entity1 asking ' this is on ? can it get me from there ? ' - the comments reveal @entity1 as someone confident and ambitious in his political future			1
when asked by @entity21 why he was running for office when he was wealthy and could live off the ' fat of the land ' , @entity1 replied : ' i think the rewards are , first , infinite			1

there ’s so many kinds of being dishonest , the money part is just only one of them			0

on what sets him apart to be president i ’m having the same struggle that they ’re [ @entity87 ] having in a different sphere , but in the most sort of dramatic way , for the great effort , the presidency of the @entity87 , my checkerboard struggle is going on			2
as i say , what is sports , spectator sports , the same thing			0
@entity98 , he might find it interesting to play in a sandlot team , in front of four people , but he ’s playing for the @entity103 , the best team in the @entity87 , for the world championship			0
