by @entity0 she might be just 16 years old but @entity1 from @entity2 has big plans for her future - and for that of her family			1
despite her tender years and lack of work , @entity1 is planning for life as a benefits mother - much to the horror of her mother @entity13 , 38			1
' i think kids should n't have kids and i told that to @entity1 before she got pregnant , ' fumes @entity13 , 38 , who has a part time role as a delivery driver for @entity19			1
pregnant : @entity1 , 16 , is pregnant and has dropped out of school to live on benefits ' i do n't think it is right			1
i think they should both work , work until they 're much older and can provide and be responsible for a child			0
' @entity1 , however , says she wants to move out and plans to move into a council flat with boyfriend @entity28 , 17 , when the baby arrives			0
' i do feel bad for [ moving out and getting benefits ] but obviously i need the money to provide for a baby so she 's [ @entity13 ] just going to have to deal with it , ' says @entity1			2
' i do n't care what people say about me being 16 and pregnant because i wanted it and it 's not their lives and anyone can look after a baby - it 's not hard to do			1
' @entity1 's hometown , @entity2 , has a teenage pregnancy rate 60 per cent higher than the national average - and the unemployment figures to match			2
not only is the @entity48 town home to the highest percentage of job seekers in the @entity52 , the youth unemployment rate is above 25 per cent			0
worried : @entity53 says he wants to finish college and get a job to support his new family children : @entity1 's mother @entity13 , 38 , says she is horrified by her daughter 's choice and wants her to get a job as a result , many teenagers , among them @entity1 's sister @entity63 , 19 , and brother @entity65 , 18 , have joined the dole queue and show little inclination to do anything else			1
' teenagers are a pain in the backside , ' says their mother @entity13 , ' because when there 's nothing out there for them , they do n't want to get up , they do n't want to do anything , they complain they 're bored ... they 're the bane of my life they are ! ' @entity13 herself was on the dole until recently , only getting a job when faced with losing Â£ 120 a week in child benefits should @entity1 move out			1
nevertheless , she has high hopes for her children and says she 'd like them to do better , in particular @entity63			0
' it 's quite annoying to think that you are 19 - years - old and you ca n't do anything , ' complains a furious @entity13 to a reluctant @entity63			1
' you could be a barrister			0
you could be a solicitor ! ' unfortunately for @entity63 , she , like @entity1 , has little in the way of qualifications and failed to pass her @entity98 and maths @entity97			2
@entity53 does have qualifications and has just started college but despite admitting to misgivings , says he will go along with @entity1 's plans for a benefits baby			2
bad odds : @entity1 and @entity53 live in @entity2 , one of the worst parts of the country for youth unemployment hard : @entity1 's sister @entity63 and brother @entity65 both sign on due to lack of job and learning opportunities ' it was a real shock due to me being really young and having just started college , so not really able to provide for a baby , ' says @entity53 of the moment he discovered he would become a father			1
' thanks to the benefits system , it 's going to be a lot easier			0
' @entity1 has no such qualms , with her only complaint being told she ca n't start claiming benefits on her own account until the baby is born			1
' i was so happy , ' she says of the moment her pregnancy was confirmed			0
' i was just smiling in the doctors but i knew i wanted it			0
i ca n't wait to move out ! ' while @entity53 has qualms about being on benefits and @entity13 has found a part time job , it seems the only member of the @entity1 family reluctant to sign on is the youngest , 15 - year - old @entity139			1
' i 'm not going to be signing on because you do n't learn anything from that , ' he insists			0
' i think everyone who signs on in this house is ridiculous ! ' but @entity13 has other ideas			0
' he 's got learning difficulties to an extent , he 's deaf ... i suppose if somebody saw him , they would say he was going to end up on the social			0
' for @entity139 's sake , you ca n't help but hope she 's wrong			2
the @entity1 family appear on @entity52 on benefits : life on the @entity159 , which airs tonight at 9pm on @entity160			0

@entity1 , 16 , from @entity2 is pregnant and plans to live on benefits
says she does n't care what people think and has dropped out of school
ca n't claim until child is born , so living with mother @entity13 , 38
although @entity13 has a job , the rest of the family is unemployed
@entity63 , 19 , and @entity174 , 18 , both sign on while @entity139 , 15 , is at school
@entity13 says @entity139 , who wants to be a *footballer* , is also likely sign on
