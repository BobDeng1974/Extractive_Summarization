tornado crews flying over @entity1 say their mission is ' personal ' as they seek ' some sort of justice ' for murdered @entity6 engineer @entity5			1
the 44 - year - old @entity8 aid worker , who served with the force for 12 years , was beheaded by @entity11 militants in a shocking propaganda video after being taken hostage in @entity14			1
now servicemen and women based in @entity17 in @entity18 - who have so far not unleashed firepower on any suitable targets in nothern @entity1 - say they want to stop other captives suffering the same fate as their former colleague			1
@entity8 hostages @entity26 and @entity27 are still being held under threat of execution by the same fighters			2
' add to that , one of their victims was a former @entity6 serviceman , and it definitely feels a bit personal for all of us here			2
' it 's not about revenge but perhaps some sort of justice – and certainly the hope that we can stop more people suffering the way @entity5 and other captives have			1
' their comments came as @entity6 jets flew armed sorties for a second day over @entity1 yesterday – but again failed to locate any suitable targets for their weapons			2
defence chiefs insisted that the flights by @entity69 fighter - bombers were invaluable for gathering intelligence on the @entity72 jihadists who have swept across large swathes of @entity1 and @entity14 , carrying out massacres			0
but the failure to unleash any firepower has fuelled concern that @entity8 is failing to pull its weight in the international coalition against @entity80			1
on a mission : the @entity6 jets seek out their terror targets - which they failed to find and bomb , again military commanders warned that @entity8 should brace itself to be dragged into a ground war in @entity1 to crush @entity86 , which is also known as @entity11 and @entity11			1
former top brass also warned that the air campaign would be futile unless the @entity8 could target the terrorists in @entity14			1
a female fighter pilot led @entity8 's first combat mission against @entity80			1
the woman , who has not been named , flew one of the @entity94 on the perilous sortie over jihadist - held territory in northern @entity1 on saturday			2
stationed at @entity17 in @entity18 , she is believed to be a weapons systems operator			0
she sits in the jet 's rear seat and fires the aircraft 's @entity101 and @entity102 missiles and @entity105 bombs			0
the airwoman , who serves with @entity107 , flies at exactly the same combat level as her male colleagues			0
a @entity111 source said : ' no one makes a big fuss of having a female pilot			0
we have females in aircrews and ground crews and they are here because of their abilities			0
everyone is just doing their jobs			0
' the involvement of a woman @entity6 pilot comes amid reports that the family of @entity128 of the @entity129 , who flew an f - 16 jet in bombing raids against positions in @entity14 last week , has disowned her			1
while the @entity111 confirmed that the @entity6 's third mission had – like on saturday – failed to locate any targets , @entity134 - led coalition aircraft targeted four makeshift oil refineries under is control in @entity14 , as well as a command centre			1
the mobile refineries generate up to £ 1.2million a day for the militants			0
on friday , @entity142 won @entity144 's backing for air attacks against fanatics in @entity1 but , crucially , he stopped short of seeking permission to allow @entity8 jets to bomb targets in @entity14 , where @entity86 has its stronghold			1
by contrast , the @entity134 and @entity152 nations – including @entity153 , the @entity129 and @entity154 – have sent their jets to bombard is positions around the city of @entity159 , in northern @entity14 , where it is believed @entity8 hostages @entity26 and @entity27 are being held under threat of execution			1
lord @entity164 , who retired as head of the @entity166 last year , was among a number of senior military figures who warned that the extremists could not be defeated by air attacks alone			1
he said @entity172 governments had blundered by ruling out the deployment of ground troops and suggested a military campaign on the scale of the attacks that toppled @entity178 in 2003 was needed to crush @entity86			0
then , a force of 380,000 troops – including 45,000 @entity8 service personnel – invaded @entity1			0
lord @entity164 said : ' how the hell can you win the war when most of your enemy can end up in a country you ca n't get involved in ? ' he said @entity1 and @entity189 forces should be trained and armed to fight a ground war against the militants			1
but if they fail , the @entity192 should be prepared to send in troops			0
' ultimately , you need a land army to achieve the objectives we 've set – all air will do is destroy elements of @entity86 , ' said lord @entity164			0
' the only way to defeat is is to take back land they are occupying , which means a conventional military operation			0
' major general @entity205 , a former commander in the @entity206 who recaptured the @entity207 , agreed that an air campaign by itself would not be enough			0
stand ready : a @entity8 tornado fighter jet crew member stands on his @entity69 at @entity17 in @entity18 armed : a tornado at @entity17 is loaded with a laser - guided bomb ' i think we should have forward air controllers to ensure that targeting is done properly			1
' lord @entity216 , a former chief of the general staff , said : ' attacking @entity11 from the air solely above @entity1 is dealing with half a problem , not all of it			2
the @entity134 has correctly concluded that carrying the fight against @entity11 into @entity14 airspace is right – we may yet come to the same conclusion			2
' defence secretary @entity222 warned that the @entity6 's mission – codenamed @entity224 – could last years			2
' this is not a weekend campaign , ' he said			0
' this is going to take a long time			0
' @entity8 has deployed six two - seater @entity94 , a refuelling aircraft and a spy plane from @entity17 in @entity18			1
airmen spoke yesterday of their mission against @entity86 feeling ' personal ' following the beheading of former @entity6 serviceman @entity5			1
one ground crew member , who declined to be named amid security concerns , said : ' any human being would be horrified by what is is doing to @entity8 hostages			0
add to that one of their victims was a former @entity6 serviceman and it definitely feels a bit personal for all of us here			0
it 's not about revenge , but perhaps some sort of justice			2

source said @entity6 crews in @entity18 hope to stop any more captives suffering
@entity254 mission was ' not about revenge but perhaps some sort of justice '
@entity8 aid worker @entity5 , 44 , spent 12 years as an @entity6 engineer
he was murdered by @entity11 militants after being held hostage in @entity14
just six @entity94 have *joined* the mission to bombard @entity80
failure to drop bombs has fuelled concern @entity8 is not pulling its weight
