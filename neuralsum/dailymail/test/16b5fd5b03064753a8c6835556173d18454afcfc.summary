the richest fight of all time continues to break through the barriers of history – mostly in terms of financial records , naturally			2
for the first time in the annals of boxing – as @entity11 and @entity12 step on the scales next friday – fans will be charged for admission to a weigh - in			1
this formality for checking that combatants weigh no more than the stipulated poundage for each division started to become an event in its own right in 2007 when @entity22 went to @entity23 to take his @entity25 tilt at the @entity11 windmill			1
@entity11 with girlfriend @entity27 ( left ) and @entity12 with his wife @entity28 ( right ) @entity12 with his wife and children ( left to right ) @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 @entity11 visits @entity36 in @entity23 , a new - age version of the ice bath no fewer than 30,000 of the @entity40 's army followed him across the @entity41 and thousands of them turned up for the weigh - in			1
the atmosphere was electrified when @entity22 yelled ' let 's be having him ' as @entity11 was about to follow him onto the stage			2
@entity22 would be knocked out but there was more of the same when he went back to the @entity48 to suffer the same fate against @entity12 two years later			0
since then weigh - ins there have turned into sound and light spectacles , taking place inside the @entity55 itself , and the audiences keep growing			1
the decision to sell tickets for this one has been made in the interests of safety , not profit			0
up to 200,000 visitors are expected to pour into @entity23 this fight week and the @entity65 need to control the crowds at all the associated events			2
thousands of fans watched @entity22 and @entity11 weigh - in at the @entity48 @entity22 points towards the crowd during his heated weigh - in with @entity11 in december 2007 @entity11 poses in his @entity71 clothing as he takes a break from training over the weekend to avoid accusations of cashing in on the phenomenon the hotel and both promoters – @entity11 and @entity78 – will donate all revenue from the weigh - in to charities nominated by the @entity82 and the @entity12			1
@entity11 and @entity12 will be required to weigh not more than 10st 7lbs			1
the winner will unify the @entity86 ( @entity11 ) and @entity87 ( @entity12 ) world welterweight titles			2
@entity90 , as he makes a rare appearance in the @entity89 this saturday , admits that at 39 he has to start considering when he might hang up those huge gloves			0
however , assuming he adds @entity92 to his long list of victims , that will not happen before dr @entity96 has obliged the two young pretenders to his heavyweight throne			0
namely our own @entity99 and @entity89 's ko sensation @entity101			1
@entity90 has admitted that he is considering retirement as he approaches his 40th birthday @entity90 says : ' i do have to start thinking about retirement			0
' but then the @entity106 who boxes mostly to sell - out crowds in @entity111 football stadia , adds : ' i would like to fight @entity99 , which would be a huge event in @entity113			1
' i want to fight @entity101 , to add the only remaining belt to my unified world titles			0
' unusually , both men would present @entity90 with opposition as tall or , in @entity99 's case , even taller than his own 6ft 6in			1
fury is his mandatory challenger for the @entity87 title			0
@entity101 holds the @entity86 title which was vacated by @entity90 's brother @entity123 when he retired to concentrate on the violent complexities of @entity106 politics as mayor of @entity127			1
@entity86 heavyweight champions @entity101 looks set to face @entity90 before he hangs up his gloves @entity90 is also the @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity134 champion			1
there is another factor which will tempt him to prolong his reign even further			0
currently he ranks fourth in the all - time list of successive world heavyweight title defences , with 18			2
victories over @entity92 – which looks to be something of a formality in @entity144 's @entity143 , would lift him level with @entity145 and @entity146 on 19			0
if he adds wins over @entity99 and @entity101 he will close to within just four victories of the 25 - defences record held by @entity150			2
that is likely to be an opportunity too good to refuse			0
@entity99 , pictured in action against @entity154 , is @entity90 's mandatory challenger for the @entity87 title the crushing defeat of @entity157 by the largely unheralded and , in terms of his first name , unpronounceable pole @entity160 , complicates @entity163 's exit strategy from the ring			1
one of @entity163 's two dream scenarios has been a farewell fight in @entity23 , probably against @entity167 with his box office appeal for @entity89 's @entity170 population and fans south of the border in @entity173			1
but the namesake son of an idolised father was so badly beaten up through nine rounds in @entity177 by @entity160 – suffering the first knock down of his career in the process – that he quit on his stool			0
@entity163 could choose to retire after @entity157 's defeat by @entity160 last week inadvisedly , @entity167 had agreed to a catch - weight fight with light - heavyweight contender @entity160 and is talking about going back down to @entity163 's super-middleweight division			1
whether this former middleweight champion would still be a draw after this setback is doubtful and @entity163 had said before the fight that it would hurt his plans ' if @entity167 got knocked out			0
the other swansong ambition – to fight on the @entity191 of his beloved @entity192 – suffered a setback when @entity195 agreed to come to @entity196 for their mandatory @entity130 title unifier but not to @entity163 's home town			2
retirement is becoming an increasingly attractive option for the @entity201			0
@entity167 ( right ) was stopped after nine rounds on his return to the ring following more than a year out			0

fans will be charged to watch a weigh - in for the first time when @entity11 and @entity12 step on the scales
all profits will be donated to charities nominated by the boxers
@entity11 and @entity12 will be weighed at the @entity55
@entity90 admits that he is considering retirement
the @entity106 looks set to fight @entity99 and @entity101
@entity163 may choose to retire after @entity157 's defeat by @entity160
@entity163 had hoped to face the @entity173 in @entity23 later this year
