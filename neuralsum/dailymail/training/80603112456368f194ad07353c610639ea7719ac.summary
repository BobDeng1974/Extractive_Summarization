with fears over the spread of @entity3 , the crisis in @entity4 and @entity5 and even the crowning of a new @entity7 , news bulletins have been rather full in recent days			0
but today , on @entity9 at least , there appeared to be a lack of stories as the midday broadcast opened with a view of an empty chair			1
the camera zoomed in to the familiar desk , but in the spot where the presenter usually sits was an empty chair , with newsreader @entity20 nowhere to be seen			1
she was not seated as the camera cut to the office chair where she should have been , and soon the sound of footsteps and rustling paper could be heard out of shot			1
but as ms @entity20 sat down , around 30 seconds into the broadcast , she was cool personified , calmly apologising for a ' technical blip ' and continuing as usual			1
' good afternoon , sorry for the technical blip there but we have got plenty of breaking news to bring you so let 's get on with it , ' she said with a smile			2
cool under pressure : as ms @entity20 sat down , around 30 seconds into the broadcast , she was cool personified , calmly apologising for a ' technical blip ' and continuing as usual carry on : ms @entity20 told her viewers with a smile that there was ' plenty of breaking news ' to bring them a @entity9 spokesman said ms @entity20 had intended to present the lead story from another part of the studio			1
' after reading the headlines she moved across the studio to the big screen to present the top story standing up , ' the spokesman said			0
' however an operational glitch meant she could n't be seen there and she had to return to the desk , which was why there was a brief pause and a reference to a technical blip			2
' her unflustered reaction won support from viewers on @entity81 , who praised the journalist for styling out the blunder			0
viewer @entity85 wrote : ' @ @entity86 made me chuckle an empty chair at midday ;-) ' praise : ms @entity20 's unflustered reaction also won support from viewers on @entity81 , who praised the journalist for styling out the blunder support : @entity95 , a producer for @entity98 rival @entity96 , commended ms @entity20 for her ' cool ' twitter user @ @entity100 added : ' @ @entity101 u did a @entity104 job with camera in the wrong place ... ;-) ' and @entity95 , a producer for @entity98 rival @entity96 , said : ' @entity9 12 news bulletin started with shot of empty chair			1
off air footsteps + newsreader finally appears			0
hat off to @entity112 for keeping cool			0
' it was a far cry from an incident in 2006 , in which ms @entity20 , who has worked for the @entity9 since 1999 , forgot the name of her co-presenter @entity117 during a @entity9 broadcast			2
she ended up in a fit of giggles , continuing to laugh as the headlines were read out , in an incident which often makes lists of the greatest on - air gaffes .			0
