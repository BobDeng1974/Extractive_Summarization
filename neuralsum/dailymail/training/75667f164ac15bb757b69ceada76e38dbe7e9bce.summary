miss @entity1 , who only spent 11 days in hospital , despite undergoing three operations to put a metal plate into her arm and rods and pins into her neck , said : ' i feel like i 'm living a second life			1
' i should only have had two options - complete paralysis or death			0
' with every step i took , it felt like i was on the road to recovery - each one was a little miracle to me			2
' she was driving to work at a gallery , taking care not to rush because of the icy conditions , when she lost control changing gears and her car skidded on frozen mud or leaves			1
miss @entity1 said : ' my car spun on its wheels and i ended up in a field after having hit a tree , killed a pigeon , gone through a ditch , rolled my car and smashed the driver ’s side window with my head			1
' she put her surprise recovery down to the quick thinking of passers - by , @entity71 and @entity72 , who called paramedics and helped keep her awake until they arrived			0
miss @entity1 said : ' @entity71 parked his truck across the road and took control of everything			1
he rang for the ambulance , made sure i stayed awake and did n't move			0

' recovery : miss @entity1 , an artist , had to have a ' halo ' drilled into her head to support her spine as it mended crumpled wreck : the mangled remains of her car illustrate the severity of the crash last november she said : ' when i came to , i tried to get out of my seat but @entity71 told me to stay still			1
if he had n’t have done that , i would have done more damage and it could have killed me			0

i have no idea how my mum managed to get it all out of my scarf , but it 's blue again now			0
' recovery : miss @entity1 was in hospital for just 11 days , during which time she underwent three operations rehabilitation : the artist had to have intense physio and occupational therapy to strengthen her arms miss @entity1 had to undergo months of physio and rehab , and it is still ongoing , but she said the idea that she ' should ' be dead or paralysed spurred her on			1
immediately after the crash , she had to wear a ‘ halo ’ – which was drilled into her head to support her spine – for seven days and lie perfectly flat to avoid her neck being broken			2
she through a straw lying down until her neck was strong enough to allow her to sit up in bed , and after she was discharged from hospital she was visited by a physiotherapist every day and ordered to do hours of gruelling exercises			0
she said : ' it was hell , but i was just grateful to be alive			2
' there were times when i felt quite low because my body was a lot weaker than it had been before but i just carried on taking the extra step every day and doing the little exercises to build up my arm and back again			2
' the thing that spurred me on was the thought that i had been given a second chance			1
' miss @entity1 , left , shortly after her crash and right , before it , says she is grateful for her ' second chance ' keep going : miss @entity1 now wants to train as an occupational therapist to help others who are injured during her months of physio and rehab , miss @entity1 decided to change her career , swapping art for training as an occupational therapist			1
