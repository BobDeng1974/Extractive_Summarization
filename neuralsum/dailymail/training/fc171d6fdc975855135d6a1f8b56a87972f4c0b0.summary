@entity0 gave @entity1 a winning start to his reign as caretaker coach with a 40 - 10 demolition of @entity7 leaders @entity8			1
it was the perfect end to a turbulent week at the club , with the sacking of coach @entity12 and players @entity13 and @entity15			1
but @entity16 managed to lift the club 's fortunes as hat - tricks from @entity20 and @entity21 and further tries from @entity23 and @entity24 secured a well - deserved win over @entity27 's side , whose only replies came from @entity29 and @entity30			1
gang up : @entity0 's @entity23 ( left ) and @entity20 tackle @entity34 's @entity33 standing strong : @entity0 's @entity35 is tackled by @entity34 's @entity36 ( right ) @entity20 , who has found himself playing for @entity39 side @entity37 several times this season , opened the scoring in the sixth minute when he was in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball , kick it forward and juggle it before sprinting clear to score			1
@entity35 was off target with his conversion attempt but @entity49 held a 4 - 0 lead			0
saints , without a win at @entity49 since 2007 , drew level in the 10th minute when @entity29 capitalised on a defensive lapse on @entity49 ' right - hand side to score from 40 metres out before missing the touchline conversion			1
rovers were dominating and made their territory and possession count further when they doubled their lead in the 25th minute			0
@entity35 was elusive in escaping the clutches of two @entity52 defenders to break clear and offload to the supporting @entity63 , who spun a pass outside for @entity20 to score his second of the game and restore @entity49 ' four - point lead			1
@entity35 missed his second conversion of the game but was successful with his third in the 31st minute after @entity21 , who announced on friday he would be joining @entity71 next season , scooped up a loose ball 45 metres out and sprinted home to score			2
a 14 - 4 cushion would have been a decent lead to take into half - time but @entity30 's power drive through the @entity0 defence was too much for the home side			2
@entity29 made no mistake from close to the posts to cut the deficit to 14 - 10 and @entity52 were happy to turn around just four points adrift given their lack of ball in @entity49 ' territory			0
rare score : st @entity89 's @entity29 scores his sides opening try of the game under pressure from @entity0 's @entity94 with so little between the sides , the first try of the second half was going to be crucial			2
it went @entity49 ' way thanks to a scrum 10 metres inside their own half			0
rovers went to their blind side where @entity23 took on the @entity52 line and beat them to score a 60 - metre try			1
@entity35 ' bad day with the boot continued as he missed his third conversion from four attempts , but @entity49 led 18 - 10			0
if @entity35 had landed all his kicks , @entity49 would have been 24 - 10 up - but they stretched their lead to exactly that on the hour mark when @entity20 completed his hat - trick			1
@entity116 spotted an overlap and used it well to send @entity20 over in the corner and @entity35 finally managed to convert from the touchline			0
@entity120 was secured with two @entity21 tries in as many minutes as @entity52 wilted badly			0
the second was brilliantly set up by the impressive @entity116 , who kicked through for @entity21 to score			2
the last act went to eden himself as he rounded off the scoring four minutes from time , @entity35 converting to leave the final score 40 - 10 .			0

@entity1 makes winning start following sacking of @entity12
@entity20 and @entity21 score hat - tricks in *emphatic* *victory*
@entity23 and @entity24 also add tries in win over @entity27 's side
