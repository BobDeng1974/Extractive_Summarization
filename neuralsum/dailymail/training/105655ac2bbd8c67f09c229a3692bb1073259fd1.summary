halfway into their @entity1 group stage campaign and @entity3 ’s potential progression stands on a knife edge			2
the @entity3 may sit top of @entity6 having taken five points from three games , but thursday ’s meeting with @entity10 at @entity11 is arguably a season - defining match			2
win and progression is all but assured as @entity15 ’s side would be guaranteed to sit at least three points clear at the top of the table with two games remaining			0
@entity20 ( left ) and @entity21 have been in brilliant form for @entity3 this season @entity15 ( left ) believes @entity20 and @entity21 are ' 100 per cent - the best pair of full backs in @entity25 ' but if they lose , @entity3 could find themselves a lowly third in the table and relying on results elsewhere to qualify			1
for many reasons , thursday appears to be a defining moment in @entity15 ’s reign on @entity32 – and it is almost certain that @entity3 ’s fantastic full backs will have a key part to play in its outcome			1
follow all the latest # @entity1 action on : @entity38 : @entity39 @entity40 : @ @entity41 and at @entity42 when asked how good @entity20 and @entity21 were ahead of thursday ’s clash , @entity15 smiled and replied : ' 100 per cent , they are the best pair of full backs in @entity25			1
' in previous years , full - backs only had to defend – it was a bonus if they crossed the halfway line			0
but now they have to be able to defend one - on - one , and help offensively too			0
' it is without a shadow of a doubt that @entity15 has two real gems to prowl his flanks – @entity20 and @entity21 are both competent in defence and exquisite going forward			2
yet , until @entity3 ’s mini-revival in recent weeks , they were the lone bright sparks in a campaign in which @entity3 were jammed in first gear and struggling to find the clutch pedal			0
@entity21 has scored three goals for @entity3 so far this season , picking up one assist along the way former @entity65 defender @entity20 has grabbed an impressive eight assists in all competitions the first season honeymoon at @entity11 is well and truly over for @entity15 and the @entity69 has found his second campaign a heck of a lot tougher			1
kick - off : thursday , november 6 , 8.05pm tv : @entity75 from 5.30pm primarily the heart of his defence has been found wanting			1
with 14 games played in all competitions @entity3 have leaked 22 goals – including 12 on their own patch in just three matches against @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			0
unfortunately for the @entity3 , @entity87 has looked every bit his 32 years too often during those matches , frequently being beaten for pace or out - foxed by clever movement			0
@entity92 – although unfortunate with injuries – has never quite looked an @entity3 player since his switch from @entity65 and , at 36 , even @entity96 is understandably now losing his seemingly endless powers of longevity			0
@entity20 celebrates scoring a penalty during @entity3 's 4 - 1 @entity1 win against @entity101 and , just to compound @entity15 ’s problems , the extremely promising @entity102 has found himself on the treatment table just when he was showing what a class performer he could become			1
@entity15 was beginning to build his whole side around the 20 - year - old @entity25 international until an ankle injury cruelly robbed him of the versatile defender out until at least the @entity111			2
but he still has two very big reasons to be positive – and their names are @entity20 and @entity21			0
for while @entity3 may have been conceding far more frequently than they would like this season , they are also scoring at a rate of two goals per game – a ratio helped tremendously by their marauding full backs			2
in 15 appearances this season , @entity20 has scored twice and assisted on an incredible eight occasions			2
@entity21 , meanwhile , has bagged three goals and contributed an assist in 10 appearances			1
@entity127 is tackled by @entity128 during @entity3 's 0 - 0 @entity6 draw against @entity10 in october however , the @entity130 ’s real importance to @entity3 can be highlighted by their results during his month - long absence between the middle of september through until october due to injury			0
in the four games @entity21 missed , @entity3 failed to win once and conceded seven times			1
since his return against @entity138 on october 18 , the @entity3 have won twice , drawn one and conceded just once			0
@entity15 ’s assessment of @entity21 and @entity20 as ‘ the best pair of full backs in @entity25 ’ may be contested by the likes of @entity144 – who has @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 at his disposal at @entity151 – but few sides rely so heavily on players tasked with defending the flanks			1
@entity3 ’s success is based on their full backs having the freedom to roam up and down the touchlines as they please – and they will be the key to defining the success of the season			1
@entity87 ( left ) has been part of an @entity3 defence which has leaked 22 goals this season expectations have risen and a trophy is desperately craved by the @entity11 faithful			0
supporters narrowly missed out on the @entity169 last term having finished outside of the top four , but the @entity1 could in fact be the @entity3 ’ gateway to taking on the continent 's very best in the future			2
for the first time ever , the winners of the @entity1 will automatically qualify for the @entity169 – either through the play - offs , or , a likely scenario in @entity3 's case , straight into the group stage should the victors in @entity184 's top competition gain entry via their league position			0
@entity3 will be hoping to keep @entity187 - bound striker @entity186 quiet at @entity11 with @entity3 having battled to a 0 - 0 draw at the @entity189 two weeks ago , the @entity3 know they are capable of shutting out @entity187 ’s on - loan @entity190 when @entity10 come to town			0
but it is up the other end of the pitch where they must impress upon a side sitting a lowly 12th in @entity197 at @entity11 on thursday , live on @entity75 ( 8.05pm kick - off )			1
and , as @entity15 will tell you , it is @entity3 ’s top - class full backs who hold the key to @entity1 success this season – both against @entity10 and hopefully beyond			1
it is @entity15 ’s full backs who can march @entity3 through the gateway towards the promised land of the @entity169 by leading the @entity211 to @entity212 this season			1
