by @entity0 published : 06:53 est , 19 july 2013 updated : 11:39 est , 19 july 2013 onlookers could be forgiven for doing a triple take after scores of triplets from around the world attended an annual convention			1

the attendees took part in a mass photo - shoot and workshops on how to deal with splitting up the trios at school			2
@entity43 - who is one of three triplet sisters along with 18 - year - old sisters @entity30 and @entity31 - said : ' it 's really fun			0
it 's a unique situation			0
' everything we go through , we go through together			0
we share experiences with each other - and how we feel about them			0
' it 's a connection with another person the same age - so it 's a really fun time			0
' going for a ride : three - year - old triplets @entity58 , @entity59 , and @entity60 , from @entity61 , @entity26 , in matching pink outfits matching : @entity30 , @entity31 , and @entity32 wore matching tops but made themselves distinguishable from each other with different coloured shorts and shoes seeing triple : the identical @entity70 triplets @entity71 , @entity72 , and @entity73 from @entity74 , @entity75 the @entity77 sisters have also capitalised on their triptych prowess and have been signed up for triplet modelling in print ads and tv commercials			1
over the years , they 've attended six @entity82			1
@entity32 added : ' we meet a lot of fun triplets and we usually keep in touch and try talking to each other - until we go to the next convention			1
' once we meet up , it 's a happy time because we get to meet up with more triplets			1
you do n't get to do that on a daily basis			0
' @entity94 , from @entity95 , @entity26 , is a father to an incredible two sets of triplets			1
he said : ' the second set kicked my butt because they were six years difference in age			0
we have problems going places because triplets are so rare			1
the triplets often stop traffic			1
' five sets of teenage triplets at the convention pose for a photo after going on a parade through @entity20 , pictured , in @entity9 proud parents : jumpers with ' they 're triplets			1
i 'm glad they 're mine and not yours too ! ' written on them were on sale at the annual @entity27 in @entity9 , @entity26 parade : all the triplets at the convention took part in a parade through the streets of @entity20 in @entity9 holding up signs with their names on them @entity129 from @entity130 , attended along with sisters @entity131 and @entity133			1
she said : ' i really like it [ being a triplet ] because you constantly have someone to grow up with			0
' almost everything you are going through - so are they			0
you always have someone who understands you - and i really like that			0
' you get to meet a lot of people through it - as soon as people know you 're triplets - they 're going to ask you about it			2
' the convention was started in 1991 by @entity148 , a single mother with seven children - including a set of nine - month old triplets			2
to date the largest was in 1995 when a staggering 200 sets joined together			2
easy rider : strollers built for three were a common sight at this year 's @entity27 in @entity9 sticking together : six - year - old identical boys @entity157 and @entity158 , with their fraternal triplet sister , @entity159 , join a parade of @entity82 during the annual @entity27 @entity148 said : ' there 's just some kind of forces that causes people to meet with other people who have had the same life experiences as they 've had			1
' the convention is extremely successful for the emotional well - being of the triplets themselves and the parents - that 's why it 's is so well worth it			2
' current director of the showpiece event in the triple - sibling calendar is @entity178			2
she was in attendance this year with her own trio of 17 - year - old boys , and added : ' we are a community that comes together and have lots of fun			0
' one thing people do n't realise - although they are usually seen as a group , they are very much individuals			0
' that 's something we work hard to maintain - their individuality			0
it 's probably not as much fun as people think , being grouped together all the time			0
' three times lucky : fraternal three - and - a - half year - old triplets @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity200 , from @entity201 , @entity202 , even have identical shoes ' triplets are terrific ' : the triplet convention was started in 1991 by single mother @entity148 who has seven children - including a set of nine - month - old triplets			2
