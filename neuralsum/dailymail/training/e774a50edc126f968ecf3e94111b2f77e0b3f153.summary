by @entity0 @entity2 mother @entity1 has died after suffering a heart attack while receiving a stem cell treatment in @entity5 a @entity2 mother - of - two has passed away from an apparent heart attack while receiving controversial stem cell therapy in @entity9 which remains unapproved in @entity10			1
@entity1 traveled to @entity5 in june to receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( @entity12 ) for her neurological disorder , @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , a rare disease which causes muscle spasms			1
@entity17 and friends of the mother have said it was not the controversial treatment that killed her on july 19 , but rather that the treatment was her last hope to live a pain free life			0
mrs @entity1 was inspired to undertake @entity12 after hearing of the success story of @entity29 sufferer @entity27 , who she soon became very close friends with			2
ms @entity27 underwent the same procedure last year to treat her own condition			2
the treatment involves intense chemotherapy and the patient 's own stem cells being drawn out of the blood stream before being transplanted back , in an effort to 're - grow ' their immune system from scratch			2
while the exact reason for her death remains unclear , ms @entity44 ' family remains satisfied that the hospital in @entity5 gave mrs @entity1 the best care possible			0
' @entity1 was in great pain			0
her treatments here gave her limited quality of life			0
she wanted the chance to be free of the shackles of @entity14 and enjoy a normal life as a @entity57 and wife , ' @entity27 told @entity59			2
mrs @entity1 's family do not believe she died from the hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( @entity12 ) , which she was receiving in an attempt to treat her neurological disorder , @entity14 ' it is my belief the result may well have been the same if she had been treated with @entity12 in @entity10			1
' ms @entity27 said that @entity68 van @entity1 had applied for @entity12 in @entity10 , but that she grew desperate for treatment as the wait for approval continued and her health deteriorated			1
' the key thing is that her doctors here said that they would try and do a hematopoietic stem cell transplant , but it was all held up in red tape and she just could n't wait , so we need to get a move on and get this happening in @entity10 , ' ms @entity27 said			1
' it is currently in extremely limited trials in @entity84 , with very few patients who meet strict criteria being accepted			0
@entity12 is currently performed for @entity29 in over a dozen first - world countries			0
the @entity10 healthcare system is too conservative and the funding for clinical trials is too limited			0
@entity27 , a close friend of mrs @entity1 who received the same treatment to treat her @entity29 , said @entity1 's health was deteriorating as she waited for the procedure to be approved for her in @entity10 ' the @entity94 has been trialling this treatment for over a decade and @entity94 approval is expected in 2022			1
when will @entity10 catch up with the rest of the world ? ' both ms @entity27 and mrs @entity1 received @entity12 in the @entity99 in @entity5 , which currently has a waiting list of over two thousand people from around the world , according to dr @entity103			1
nine @entity10 are currently being treated by the hospital as 300 more await their turn			1
the @entity5 hospital where ms @entity1 ( pictured ) was being treated , currently had a waiting list of 300 other @entity10 hoping to undergo the treatment which is not approved in @entity10 ' the demand for pro-active , clinically - researched treatments for @entity29 is massive			1
current successful applicants are being given dates in 2016 , ' ms @entity27 , who is currently assisting 80 @entity10 seeking @entity12 from the @entity99 hospital , said			2
' patients are sick of being told that this is a " liveable " disease			0
those who seek @entity12 feel their current quality of life and the negative outlook for their health outweighs the small risk associated with this treatment			0
' the demand is so high however , that the hospital was recently forced to delayed a number of treatment dates for approved @entity10 patients			1
ms @entity27 has set up a fundraising page to help mrs van @entity44 ' family pay for her funeral costs .			0
