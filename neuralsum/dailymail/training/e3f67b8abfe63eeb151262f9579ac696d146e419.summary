by @entity0 we ’ve all done it at some point – taken a wrong turn at a roundabout and ended up in entirely the wrong place			2
or put too much faith in the car sat - nav , and found ourselves many miles from our planned destination , wondering how we could have been so stupid			0
under investigation : @entity12 managed to land at an airport 62 miles from its destination but then , few of us are airline pilots flying in the competitive south - east asian market			1
and few of us have done what the crew of a @entity20 @entity19 did earlier this week – and landed at the wrong airport , over 60 miles from where we should have been			1
all staff who were on flight vj8861 – operated by budget carrier @entity12 – have been suspended after the aircraft touched down at @entity29 airport , near @entity30 – a popular holiday resort on @entity20 ’s east coast			1
the incident happened on 19 june , but the full story of what went wrong is yet to emerge			2
the plane was scheduled to land at @entity37 , near @entity38 , which sits a full 62 miles west of @entity30 – and nowhere near the sea – in @entity20 ’s @entity40			1
here 's where you went wrong : @entity43 landed in @entity30 ( @entity44 ) when it should have been in @entity38 ( a ) the @entity46 of @entity20 ( @entity47 ) has taken swift action against the flight crew , pending an investigation			1
the regulator says that its preliminary findings reveal a ‘ serious incident … posing [ a ] threat to aviation safety			0
’ the @entity47 also says that , according to its early research , crew , pilots and ground staff failed to follow proper procedures			0
it adds that ‘ appropriate measures ’ will be taken against the airline once the investigation is complete			2
@entity12 has not yet explained how the plane came to arrive at the wrong airport			0
the aircraft was carrying 180 passengers – all of whom had to be transferred on a second flight			0
it 's good , but it 's not right : @entity30 is a popular holiday hotspot - but it was not the plane 's destination @entity12 launched in 2011 , and has thrived in the crowded skies over south - east @entity78 , taking 25 per cent of the @entity20 domestic aviation market			1
until this incident , it had an unblemished safety record – although it was reprimanded by the @entity47 in 2012 for staging an on - board @entity83 - themed dance , performed by beauty - pageant contestants , without clearing the event with the safety body .			0

investigation underway as to how budget airline went so badly wrong
@entity91 managed to land in an entirely different part of @entity20
@entity20 's @entity46 describes error as a ' serious incident '
