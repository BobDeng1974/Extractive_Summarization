the new version of @entity8 , which hit screens earlier this month on @entity10 , was supposed to have been updated for the 21st century			2
but despite dad using a tablet computer and mum spending time on her laptop , the series - inspired by the hugely popular books and animated tv show of the same name - appears to be stuck in the past			0
most of the outrage is over the way the characters conform to gender stereotypes			1
one parent , who called themselves @entity46 posted : ' i caught it for the first time tonight and thought it was a load of rubbish			0
' i hated the boys playing on quads and girls decorating princess cupcakes too - @entity6 ’s friend a boy , @entity5 ’s a girl etc the show is inspired by the hugely popular books ( pictured ) and animated tv show of the same name ' p * * sed all over my fond childhood memories of reading the books ...			1
' another parent , called @entity64 added : ' it ’s flabbergastingly sexist - i was so disappointed			0
