by @entity0 published : 06:01 est , 8 april 2013 updated : 19:56 est , 8 april 2013 this is the moment a teenage rider narrowly escaped death from a kick in the face from her horse			1
@entity7 , 18 , was being filmed by a friend as she trained eight - year - old @entity9 over jumps at her home			1
but she was thrown to the ground when @entity9 refused to take one of the jumps			1
the film shows the spooked horse turning and kicking out in fright , catching his owner above her left eye with a sickening thud			1
she was left with blood pouring from a gash above her eye , and the muscles needed to be stitched back together			1
doctors said she was lucky to survive and added that her riding helmet had absorbed the brunt of the blow			1
yesterday she said the incident at her home in @entity39 , @entity53 , had not put her off riding , although she will have to wait another week before she returns to the saddle because of a risk of infection to her wound			0
she said : ' i did n't really know what had happened at first , i just saw blood trickling down my face and my head was really , really sore , ' she said , adding that a family friend who came to her aid thought she had ' walked into a horror film '			0
' there was blood everywhere , ' said @entity7			2
' if i had n't been wearing my riding hat , i would have been a lot more seriously injured , if not dead			0
' i did n't always used to wear it when i was riding @entity9 , but i will from now on			2
' amazing bond ' : the student , from @entity40 , said she would ' never ' let getting injured put her off riding the student was taken to hospital by the friend of her mother 's , where doctors stitched the muscles back together above her eye			1
' i 'm so lucky to have escaped with a cut to my head - once my stitches are out , i might need further plastic surgery on the scar , but the doctors are going to wait to see what it looks like , ' the student said			1
despite her ordeal , @entity7 said she is still determined to pursue her dream of becoming a mounted police officer			2
the 18 - year - old said she would ' never ' let the risk of being injured put her off riding her beloved horse , and said she and @entity9 share an ' amazing bond '			1
@entity7 , who has been riding for four years , trained eight - year - old @entity9 herself - teaching him how to jump and perform complicated stunts			1
and the student is already keen to get back in the saddle after her accident last monday			2
' i 'm most upset that i ca n't see my horses for a week , because of the risk of infection , ' she said			0
' i love my horses and getting injured is a risk i have to take			0
i 'd never let it put me off			0
' i want to make everyone aware of how dangerous horses can be - they need to be respected , ' the teenager said			0
' i do n't believe for a second that @entity9 would have ever meant to have hurt me			2
i 've owned him for two years and we have an amazing bond			0
' but it does n't take much to frighten a horse , and they 're flight animals - they kick out in fear or shock , not aggression			2
' people need to understand how powerful they are			0
' @entity9 very rarely refuses a jump , but on this occasion , i had n't given him enough of a run up , and he just could n't get over it			1
it was n't his fault			0
' i think my mum and dad worry about me , but i 'll keep doing what i love			0
