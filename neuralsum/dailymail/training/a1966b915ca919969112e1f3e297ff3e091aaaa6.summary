by @entity0 the world 's first suicide prevention app is set to be launched in @entity3 , specifically targeting young people in @entity6 and @entity7 communities			1
@entity8 is a joint venture between @entity10 and the @entity3 based suicide prevention group @entity12 and aims to reach young people in indigenous communities			1
suicide is the leading cause of death among all @entity17 aged between 15 and 44 years - old and accounts for 1.6 percent of all deaths on a national level			2
but among @entity6 and @entity22 , suicide counts for 4.2 percent of all deaths and the suicide rate of young indigenous @entity17 is five times higher than the rate for non-indigenous youth			1
@entity8 is the first suicide prevention app in the world and aims to reduce the rate of suicide among indigenous australians ' we know what the risk factors are for suicide in the general population and those risk factors are more prevalent in some @entity6 communities â€“ social and econ disadvantage , isolation , and we know that when unemployment goes up so does the rate of suicide , ' dr @entity39 , research fellow at @entity10 told @entity42			1
' that 's only one part of it though , what we know is that there 's been clusters of suicide , it gets to a level in some communities where suicide becomes a normal coping mechanism , ' she said			0
the app , the first of its kind in the world , derives its name from a @entity59 greeting , " @entity60 bubbly ? " , which means " hey brother , how you doing ? " its aim is to decrease suicidal thinking and increase help - seeking among indigenous youth , particularly those in remote communities which are often lacking essential health services			2
' we know that indigenous australians are not seeking face to face mental health care , more than 70 percent of indigenous suicides occur in people who are not previously known to health services , ' said dr @entity39			2
' @entity76 youth have a high rate of mobile phone usage so it makes sense that we engage them on technology they are comfortable with and able to use in their own private time			0
' the app , the first of its kind in the world , derives its name from a @entity59 greeting the app is a joint venture between @entity10 and @entity3 - based charity @entity89 the app aims to reach people who may not have access to mental health services in their community dr @entity39 and other researchers have spent the last year in the @entity59 work - shopping the app and trying to find out how to reach indigenous youth			1
the app works by teaching young people psychological lessons and helping them to deal with negative emotions through interactive games , which often draw from indigenous metaphors , images and stories			1
dr @entity39 , research fellow from the @entity10 , has been working with local indigenous youth in the @entity108 , work - shopping methods to engage with indigenous youth for example , says dr @entity39 , the app uses metaphors drawn from nature to explain psychological concepts and has suggestions for dealing with emotions that are culturally relevant			2
' we suggest going and having a conversation with someone in your first language if your first language is an indigenous language [ if feeling strong negative emotions ] , so some of those more culturally relevant activities , ' she told @entity42			0
another aim of the app is to provide a way for indigenous young people to seek help anonymously , which is often impossible for people living in small			1
' what we know is that particularly among young men , the rate of help seeking incredibly low and one of the big barriers is shame			0
what we 're testing is whether an intervention that is relatively anonymous could help with that			0
if you 're living in a small community and everyone knows everyone , how do you anonymously seek help ? ' said dr @entity39			0
a pilot testing the government - funded app in the @entity59 is about to come to a close and the researchers will look to expand into a nationwide trial next year before launching			0
anyone who is suffering from depression or mental health issues should contact lifeline on 131 114 ( @entity3 ) the @entity156 on 1800 273 8255 ( @entity157 ) or the @entity158 on 08457 90 90 90 ( @entity159 ) , or a local help group			0
