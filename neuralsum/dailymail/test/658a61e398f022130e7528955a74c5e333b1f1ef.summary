ever fancied driving the @entity0 straight from the big screen and into your street ? or perhaps you 've always yearned to take the @entity5 ' cadillac for a spin ? well now it 's possible to do both thanks to brothers @entity9 and @entity11 - who have designed and built a fantastic fleet of movie - inspired vehicles			1
among their wonders on wheels are lifelike versions of @entity18 's @entity0 from the @entity20 film trilogy and the much - loved @entity5 car - or @entity22 - 1 as the spook - hunting team call it			1
the brothers have even made an @entity26 truck , based on the most recent @entity28 movie , as well as a @entity30 - inspired motorbike			1
' we test - drove one of our motorcycles on the road and the police were called because we were causing a traffic jam			2
if you 're doing something that 's causing that kind of reaction , you know you 're doing something right			2
' take bat ! the brothers ' impressive version of the @entity0 , @entity18 's car in the @entity20 trilogy attention to detail : the number plate and interior are very similar to the original @entity0 real deal : the @entity0 in the 2005 movie @entity71 , which was directed by @entity72 the car - crazy brothers from @entity40 , @entity41 , started building versions of the vehicles they most loved for their own enjoyment four years ago			1
@entity9 , 45 , said : ' we did n't have the money to pay people to customise vehicles for us , and what we needed did n't exist so we had to learn to build our parts			2
' every part of the @entity0 was made from scratch in our shop - the frame , chassis , wheels , glass , everything			2
' i do n't know what it cost to build - i 'd probably cry if i looked into it - but as far as value , it 's one of the most expensive vehicles we own			1
' prime mover : a truck made to look like autobot @entity26 in last year 's transformers : age of extinction neat fleet : @entity9 ( left ) and @entity11 show off their @entity30 - inspired bike and other vehicles at their workshop he and @entity11 , 44 , have now turned their hobby into a business - called @entity110 - and they hire out their movie - inspired cars and motorbikes to fans			1
they also customise standard cars and bikes for clients , several of whom are famous			0
@entity11 is in charge of design , while mechanic @entity9 brings the drawings to life in the brothers ' workshop			0
he said : ' we mostly deal with a lot of celebrities and royalty since they have disposable income			0
' we 've had clients like @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 , and have done work for @entity137			0
' the movie cars are used in promotions or premiers - clients want something that can be driven around rather than sit there like any other prop			0
' some of these cars can cost upwards of close to a million dollars , depending on what it is			0
' classic car in a classic movie : the real @entity151 being driven in the 1984 blockbuster ghostbusters almost identical : the @entity154 ' version makes a fuel stop - and puts the other cars in the shade it has n't always been an easy ride , however			0
@entity9 said : ' @entity11 thinks if he can draw it , i can build it - but it 's more difficult than that			1
' he knows very little about mechanics so he 's not limited like a lot of designers who have engineering degrees - there 's nothing holding him back when it comes to design			1
' in the beginning we fought because we come from different realms but now it 's a back - and - forth process			1
' made to order : the brothers in a @entity178 that they customised to look like an army tank for a customer rev - elations : @entity9 on one of his bikes , and the @entity186 that has won a world record the brothers ' ingenuity has earned them a place in the @entity191 , namely for their ' @entity186 ' , which was commissioned by the @entity193 bike company for the re-release of the 1970s toy of the same name			0
the @entity198 ' version has a 43 - inch ( 109 - cm ) front wheel - the largest ever wheel on a three - wheeled motorbike - and is powered by a @entity202 motor			1
@entity9 said : ' when someone says it ca n't be built , we got ta build it - we push ourselves and show people that you do n't have to be limited to what 's out on the market			2
' we always want to get that wow factor			0
and when it 's finished , it 's like seeing a kid being born			0
