former @entity1 assistant boss @entity0 has blamed @entity3 ’s fitness regime for the catalogue of injuries at @entity6 after @entity7 became the club ’s 43rd casualty of the season			1
it is also the third time that @entity7 has been sidelined since @entity14 ’s arrival last summer after he limped out of monday ’s win at @entity16 with a groin strain			1
the @entity19 defender will be assessed further on wednesday but is rated extremely doubtful for sunday ’s game at home to @entity22			0
@entity1 are currently also without summer signings @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , while @entity27 and @entity28 have just returned to training			2
@entity1 defender @entity7 ( left ) was taken off injured against @entity16 on monday former @entity1 assistant manager @entity0 has blamed fitness changes for the injury crisis @entity0 , who spent 12 years working alongside sir @entity32 at @entity6 , believes that @entity14 ’s decision to bring in his own fitness specialist @entity35 to oversee first - team training at the start of the season and give @entity39 a broader role has led to the injury pile - up with so many players ‘ breaking down ’			1
‘ what ’s happened is a continuation of the same players getting injured all the time , so you have to look to the reasons why , ’ said @entity0 , who is now first - team coach at @entity48			1
‘ i think @entity1 changed their thoughts on the fitness regime			1
they looked at it a little bit differently			0
‘ @entity39 , who was operating as head of sports science and was involved day to day with the first - team			2
he understood the ins and outs of how to keep players fit , how to keep them ready for competition			0
@entity1 boss @entity3 believes he does not need to strengthen his defence in january despite injuries ‘ then suddenly they moved him sideways and did something completely different			1
that may have had an effect			0
that one area has changed			0
‘ they ’ve brought in new people with a different way of doing things			0
the intensity of training may be one thing – it may be too intense , or not intense enough – but obviously slight changes have been made with the present way of doing things			0
‘ i would have thought the squad is big enough at @entity1 , because they can go out and get players in , but obviously they keep breaking down and they do n’t seem to be getting any better			2
they seem to get one back and lose another two			0
’ @entity0 ( left ) enjoyed a trophy - laden spell as @entity1 assistant manager under sir @entity32 @entity7 went off after just 18 minutes at @entity83 ’s with what @entity14 later said was a ‘ suspected muscle tear ’			1
the problem is understood to be in the player ’s groin and he is set to go undergo further tests			0
the 25 - year - old has already been sidelined for two months of the season after suffering a groin strain at @entity93 in august and then picking up a thigh injury in training in september just one game into his comeback			1
@entity7 missed another match through suspension after collecting what @entity14 called a ‘ stupid ’ red card in the @entity103 derby			2
@entity104 , with @entity105 ( left ) and @entity106 ( right ) celebrates their 2 - 1 win at @entity16 @entity7 has already missed two months of this season through injuries and suspension his future at @entity1 has been the subject of some speculation with @entity115 continuing to show an interest			1
however , @entity1 are unlikely to let any players leave – particularly centre - backs – while they continue to be plagued by injuries , and @entity14 has ruled out trying to solve the problem by simply buying more players in the january transfer window			1
‘ when you have injuries you can not solve the problem otherwise , ’ said the @entity1 boss			2
‘ do we have to buy players ? no , we have more than enough			0
