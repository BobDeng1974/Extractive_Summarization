the best footballers on the planet had the chance to earn up to $ 1million each for playing in an exhibition match at the end of the season , only for the project to be vetoed by their clubs			1
the idea was for an annual @entity10 v @entity9 game to be staged at the @entity12 and modelled on basketball ’s @entity14 all - star game			1
the plans were advanced enough for there to be confidence last @entity19 that the top - secret project would go ahead			2
the finances were said to stack up , helped considerably by massive @entity23 sponsorship , while tv rights were well advanced			0
@entity26 ( left ) and @entity27 could both have been involved in the all - star game @entity30 star @entity29 was another name who super agent @entity32 could have invited to play super agent @entity32 was involved , suggesting his stable of @entity26 , @entity29 , @entity34 , @entity27 , @entity35 and @entity36 would have been willing participants			1
club managers , such as another @entity32 client @entity39 , would not have taken charge of the two sides to avoid conflict			2
national team bosses would have been hired			0
there would have been a sliding scale for fees but certainly @entity26 would have been in the top seven - figure bracket			2
however , the major obstacle was the crowded football calendar and the clubs , who would have been paid as well , finally vetoed the all - star game at the january meeting of the @entity54			1
the clubs had also wanted a bigger share of the proceeds			0
@entity57 , risk - taking city financier who made and then lost a fortune during the first dotcom bubble , was another well - known name connected with the aborted match			0
@entity34 could have been involved and earned up to $ 1million with the rest of the players super agent @entity32 would also have tried to get his client @entity36 involved in the all - star game @entity67 ambassador @entity39 will escape censure from the network after he chose arch rivals @entity70 ’s goals on sunday for his 27 - minute diatribe on referee @entity73			1
the grey area of @entity39 ’s contract with @entity67 allows him to appear on rival channels — aside from routine managerial commitments — when the club insist			0
@entity30 say @entity39 ’s @entity70 showing was a joint decision made after the 1 - 1 draw with @entity82			0
@entity67 are more annoyed with @entity39 ’s representatives for letting it happen than @entity39 himself			0
@entity39 made a surprise guest appearance on @entity70 's goals on sunday despite his @entity67 links a tweet sent by @entity91 ’s maverick @entity90 director @entity89 after his club ’s victory over @entity94 last weekend is being examined by the @entity95			1
@entity96 intimated on social media that he bet on the @entity99 ’ win , breaching @entity95 betting regulations — but he has claimed it was not his betting slip posted			0
the @entity90 , who owns five per cent of @entity91 shares , is the subject of a club probe after describing compatriot and @entity94 manager @entity107 as an ‘ arrogant b * * * * * * ’ to @entity90 media			0
wallpaper business boss @entity96 has a chequered past as a convicted football hooligan			0
the @entity113 are aware of his police record , but it is spent — so he passes the owners and directors test			0
@entity89 ( left ) is being investigated by the @entity95 after his comments about @entity107 relationships between the @entity119 and @entity10 , never good at the best of times , have sunk to an all - time low after @entity10 ’s acceptance of a @entity122 finishing on december 23			1
this despite arch diplomat @entity123 , @entity119 representative on the @entity95 , being on the @entity10 executive			1
the @entity119 blame president @entity125 for dominating all @entity10 strategy , which includes persuading @entity127 to reverse his decision not to stand for election as the @entity131 vice-president on the @entity133 executive			2
no wonder the @entity95 have such a low opinion of @entity133 when they are provocative enough to include @entity137 ’s @entity136 as a member of their delegation at the rules - deciding @entity142 in @entity143 tomorrow			1
@entity133 executive member @entity136 , who is being investigated by the ethics committee for breaches of the @entity122 bidding code , probably has the most acrimonious relationship with the @entity95 of any @entity149 powerbroker			2
after the 2018 @entity122 election fiasco , a proposed friendly international between @entity150 and @entity137 , set up in anticipation of @entity136 supporting @entity150 ’s bid , was called off			2
and @entity136 took legal action against former @entity95 chairman @entity156 for alleging , under parliamentary privilege , that @entity136 wanted the tv rights to that game			1
@entity133 say @entity136 was chosen by the @entity160 , whose choice it was on a rotational basis			0
@entity164 will come face to face with an old foe when he travels to the @entity168 @entity136 will be in attendance in @entity143 despite the legal issues he 's had with the @entity95			1

an all - star game of @entity10 and the rest of world exhibition match looked set to go ahead until top professional clubs vetoed the idea
@entity26 , @entity29 , @entity27 could have all played as their super agent @entity32 was *heavily* involved in the game
@entity91 director @entity181 being examined by the @entity95
@entity10 and the @entity119 at *loggerheads* of the @entity184 2022
the @entity95 face old foe @entity136 at the @entity187
