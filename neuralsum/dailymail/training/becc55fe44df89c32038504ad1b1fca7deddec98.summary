@entity0 are planning a £ 70million spree over the coming days to replace their ' lost boys			1
' and the @entity3 will keep tabs on some of the players @entity6 are prepared to let go as they reshape their squad			1
the south coast club want @entity6 ’s @entity10 striker @entity9 and either @entity11 or @entity12 , depending on which winger @entity13 is prepared to sell			1
@entity3 boss @entity30 has also targeted @entity32 duo @entity31 of @entity33 and @entity35 ’s @entity34 , while @entity35 goalkeeper @entity36 is another target			1
the problem for @entity0 is that other clubs will hike up their transfer fees knowing the @entity3 have banked £ 100m by selling five first - team players			1
@entity6 will this week attempt to complete the signing of @entity45 defender @entity44			1
but @entity6 will have to up their original offer of £ 17m to nearly £ 25m if they are to force @entity45 club @entity47 to sell			1
the @entity48 also want to force through the capture of @entity50 from @entity51 , while the situation regarding @entity54 striker @entity53 remains in the balance			2
@entity6 have trailed @entity53 for a long time , even before @entity56 arrived , but the @entity58 striker keeps sending out mixed messages about his future			1
that is perhaps because @entity63 ’s interest in the striker re-surfaced last week even though @entity65 has said he has completed transfer business			2
@entity67 bound ? @entity47 defender @entity44 could be heading to @entity6 for £ 25m @entity27 may try to lure @entity69 to @entity70 from @entity71			1
with @entity73 possibly sidelined for four months , the 33 - year - old could be seen as a like - for - like replacement			0
ideally the @entity27 would want the striker on loan , but @entity71 would prefer to sell @entity69 for a fee of £ 1m and clear his £ 45,000 - a - week wages off their books			1
@entity27 , who continued their busy summer of dealings by bringing in @entity83 from @entity84 on a season - long loan , may consider that as decent business			1
@entity84 will make one more bid for @entity45 midfielder @entity88 this week			1
but the @entity90 player , who is valued at around £ 30m , could disappoint @entity91 by opting for a move to @entity93			2
should that happen , then @entity91 could turn his attention to another @entity45 midfielder - @entity96 's @entity95			2
@entity91 has also insisted he wants to keep @entity98 at the club now he is back from his loan spells , but @entity101 have also shown an interest in taking the @entity103 for a year			0
@entity104 call : @entity88 could yet join @entity84 but also has the option of a return to @entity45 with @entity93 @entity28 , who have already completed some astute business this summer , are now on the trail of @entity112 ’s @entity111			1
but @entity111 's former club @entity113 are also considering making a move for a @entity112 player , striker @entity115			1
@entity113 's move comes after their bid to sign @entity118 from @entity26 for £ 8m collapsed			1
@entity120 boss @entity119 , meanwhile , has recommended to the @entity26 board to offer @entity118 a new contract and double his wages to around £ 70,000 a week			2
but the @entity125 striker is reluctant to sign a new deal with @entity120 because it would change the release clauses in his contract			2
however , if no club comes in for @entity118 before the end of the transfer window - @entity132 have yet to make an expected move - the forward may renegotiate with the newly - promoted west @entity104 side			2
@entity119 will argue to the club they will be getting a top - class striker who is already on their books for ' free ' and that if @entity118 's goals keep @entity26 in the @entity144 then the increase in wages would easily be covered			2
on the move ? @entity111 could leave @entity112 and join @entity146 at @entity28 @entity17 : @entity113 could move for @entity115 ( left ) after @entity118 's failed medical last week i am hearing @entity45 club @entity148 , who were beaten by @entity150 in their bid to sign @entity152 , have now turned their attentions to @entity6 's @entity155 playmaker @entity154			1
@entity156 while many @entity144 clubs have been trotting the globe ahead of the new campaign , @entity157 opted to travel to @entity161 in the @entity162 and work out at @entity163 - the @entity165 's £ 100m complex - ahead of their pre-season @entity167 tour			1
' the facilities are amazing , and everybody has been very impressed with the welcome we have received at @entity163 , ' @entity169 forward @entity168 said			0
' the training is fantastic , the rooms are excellent and the weather is ideal to train in every day			0
' being able to stay here and not going abroad , for example to the @entity179 , is better because the team can train better , train twice a day and at the end of the day , that will benefit us physically and tactically			0
' pass masters : @entity157 made use of the facilities at @entity163 as past of their pre-season preparation you could n’t make it up really			2
the great @entity191 club come to @entity192 for the facilities and weather while @entity192 clubs go all around the world			0
but then , as @entity13 has already identified , the pre-season schedules of @entity192 's top clubs like @entity6 have more to do with commercial interests than getting the team in the right condition , which is clearly the priority of @entity157			1
that said , after years of planning and over £ 100m spent in building a training centre to improve the grass roots as well as provide top - class facilities for @entity192 teams , @entity163 would seem to have commercial interests rather high on the agenda			2
if the place is about improving all levels of the @entity192 game , why is it being hired out to foreign teams ? at a time when school holidays are on , the management of @entity163 opted to take a lucrative booking from @entity157			0
close to home : @entity192 sides have flown to @entity221 while @entity157 were content to stay in @entity167 a few weeks back it was @entity225 side @entity223 who were the ' customers '			0
over the last years , many foreign clubs and countries have trained in @entity161			0
no doubt there are some decent coaching courses held , but it seems @entity163 has become pre-occupied with commercial considerations rather than fulfilling the purpose for which it was built , and replicating @entity236 model of @entity237			0
@entity238 it was n’t so long ago that pre-season was often about players losing excess baggage put on in the summer , but it would seem that @entity132 ’s @entity243 has been maintaining the old tradition			0
ripped black bin liners under shirts was one method of sweating off the pounds back in the day before special diets , gyms , saunas and ice baths made their way into training grounds			0
going down to the coast and running in sand was also a favoured method of restoring muscle strength - indeed , i see @entity63 have installed their own sand running track at @entity261			0
but this footage from 1935 shows how @entity27 limbered up for that season in a very basic way and also tested a novel ideal to stop conceding goals - by training with three keepers			1
btw on the subject of @entity27 , how bizarre the position of manager @entity271 has seemingly been stabilised as a consequences of @entity273 being arrested for alleged assault and put in custody on remand			1
but , even if @entity271 is in charge at the start of the season , he will have 10 games at the most to stay there			0
this time around , a bad start will spell the sack for @entity271			0
i ’m sure he is aware of it but whether he changes his game plan to lighten things up at the club remains to be seen			0
but there will be one of obvious change in the club ’s style this season			0
@entity27 have ditched traditional claret and blue shirts for an all claret top			1
so while for some they have been playing like @entity301 under @entity271 in recent reasons they will look like @entity303			0
trouble : @entity273 ( left ) is in custody after being charged with assaulting two women last weekend @entity306 why , having explained he did n’t want to upset @entity63 fans by spending a few months on loan at @entity26 is @entity310 poised to warm up for move to the @entity312 with @entity313 ' on loan ' with their parent club @entity315 ? maybe it was part of the deal ... but it will be interesting to hear what @entity65 has to say on the matter of @entity310 playing for one of @entity63 ’s main title rivals			2
@entity325 mon : @entity326 admits the last three months have been the worst of his career after that @entity330 slip then his errors in @entity192 ’s @entity333 debacle			0
@entity326 has the character to bounce back for @entity113 straight away though			0
tues : @entity27 co owner @entity335 having favourited a @entity337 message which condemned manager @entity271 then blamed jet lag for the ' mistake ' : to be fair , we ’ve all been there			1
weds : @entity63 say they will subsidise travel and tickets for fans travelling to away games			0
thurs : @entity349 who has impressed on @entity6 's tour to the @entity179 could become a surprise contender to become club captain			1
could be an inspired choice to get around the @entity354 – @entity356 issue			0
fri : @entity357 is reported as saying @entity358 should forget about aiming for a top four finish			0
even if he has a point , hardly an inspiring message to send out to long suffering @entity358 fans before a ball has been kicked .			0

@entity0 are set for a £ 70million spending spree
@entity9 , @entity11 and @entity12 are targets
@entity6 hope to sign @entity44
@entity27 could target @entity69
@entity84 could make one more bid for @entity88
@entity28 have an eye on @entity112 's @entity111
