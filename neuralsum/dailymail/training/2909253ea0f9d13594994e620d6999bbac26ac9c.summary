scientists believe they have achieved the ‘ holy grail ’ of the green economy by designing a hydrogen production plant that can split water with sunlight			1
the @entity6 envisages an array of mirrors that would focus sunlight onto a central tower several hundred feet tall			1
the tower would heat up to around 1,350 ° c - enough to liberate hydrogen from steam with the help of a metal oxide compound			1
a concept design of a hydrogen production plant that could fuel a sustainable green economy with sunlight and water			1
the tower would heat up to around 1,350 degrees @entity21 - enough to liberate hydrogen from steam with the help of a metal oxide compound an array of mirrors focuses sunlight onto a central tower several hundred feet tall			1
metal oxide compound in the tower heat up to around @entity31 and release oxygen atoms			1
this changes its material composition causing the newly formed compound to seek out new oxygen atoms			0
the addition of steam to the system - which could be produced by boiling water in the reactor with the concentrated sunlight beamed to the tower - cause oxygen from the water molecules to adhere to the surface of the metal oxide			1
this frees up hydrogen molecules for collection as hydrogen gas			2
‘ we have designed something here that is very different from other methods and frankly something that nobody thought was possible before , ’ said lead scientist professor @entity52 , from the @entity6			0
‘ splitting water with sunlight is the @entity63 of a sustainable hydrogen economy			1
’ @entity65 could be used as a fuel for roadtransport , distributed heat and power generation , and for energy storage			0
writing in the journal @entity73 , the researchers explain how their plant would adopt the same principle as using a magnifying glass to start a fire			2
‘ we can concentrate sunlight until it is really hot and use it to drive these chemical reactions , ’ said dr @entity78 , a member of the @entity6 team			2
‘ while we can easily heat it up to more than @entity84 , we want to heat it to the lowest temperature possible for these chemical reactions to still occur			0
‘ hotter temperatures can cause rapid thermal expansion and contraction , potentially causing damage to both the chemical materials and to the reactors themselves			0
’ splitting water with sunlight is described by the @entity98 scientists as the @entity63 of a sustainable hydrogen economy			1
hydrogen could be used as a greener alternative to fuel road transport , in distributed heat and power generation , and for energy storage the quantity of hydrogen produced is entirely dependent on the amount of metal oxide , a combination of iron , cobalt , aluminium and oxygen , and steam			1
a working system would require a number of towers each surrounded by several acres of mirrors			2
commercialisation of such a solar - thermal reactor is only likely to happen when the economic conditions are right , claims professor @entity52			2
‘ there would have to be a substantial monetary penalty for putting carbon into the atmosphere , or the price of fossil fuels would have to go way up , ’ he added			0
last year , @entity131 researchers claimed that they had also found the ‘ holy grail ’ of the green economy by producing petrol from air for the first time			0
@entity137 in @entity138 , @entity139 , made petrol using a small refinery that synthesises the fuel from carbon dioxide and water vapour			0
while the company said it used carbon dioxide extracted directly from the air in their reaction , it is mainly using industrial sources of the gas until it is able to improve the performance of ' carbon capture			0

the plant would use an array of mirrors to focus sunlight onto a huge tower
the tower heats up to 1,350 ° c - enough to liberate hydrogen from steam
scientists describe the process as the @entity63 of a hydrogen economy
