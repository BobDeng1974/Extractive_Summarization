‘ cowboy ’ parking squads hired by @entity2 firms are hitting hundreds of thousands of drivers with £ 100 ‘ fines ’ and using threats to make them pay up			1
the companies – employed by fast food chains , retailers and railway operators – issue what appear to be official penalty notices , similar to those used by council traffic wardens			1
they then extract huge sums from drivers who are sometimes just a few minutes late in returning to their cars			1
however , the tickets do not have the same legal standing as official fines			1
many are being issued unfairly and – in some cases – without proper legal authority			1
private firms who used to fleece motorists with clamps have simply switched tactics and now issue £ 100 tickets to those judged to have overstayed			1
but consumer groups say @entity2 names such as @entity28 ’s are letting their reputations be dragged through the mud due to their association with suspect firms hired to police their car parks			1
have you been the victim of private parking cowboys ? contact the @entity52 via parking@dailymail.co.uk some offer a limited free parking period while others charge			1
but the parking firms often issue tickets safe in the knowledge that many drivers will simply pay up even though they often have an excellent chance of winning an appeal			1
if tickets are ignored , firms often follow them up with threatening letters – sometimes purporting to be from baliffs			1
but the notices are not backed by criminal law and can not be enforced without a @entity69 order			1
the @entity52 can reveal that @entity28 ’s has a contract with @entity71 – which has links to an ‘ unfit ’ debt collection agency and a firm of solicitors which was shut down because of staff dishonesty			2
@entity71 is contracted to make sure vehicles do not stay beyond a permitted time at 104 of the fast food giant ’s car parks			2
but there have been claims that its wardens are placing £ 100 penalty notices on cars even when families are simply eating inside the restaurant			2
@entity71 also polices 21 car parks belonging to @entity90 , which runs services through @entity92 to the @entity93			2
fast food chains , including @entity95 , shops and railway operators employ companies like @entity71 , who issue what appear to be official penalty notices , similar to those used by council traffic wardens last night @entity105 , of the @entity106 , said : ‘ private parking companies are part of a bounty hunting fad which has risen up over the past few years and is making an industry of penalising people without good reason or for their simple human mistakes			1
‘ @entity115 brands like @entity28 ’s do n’t seem to appreciate how this new industry operates or the sense of anger and injustice that it produces in its victims and who are also their own customers			0
’ @entity124 president @entity123 said that ‘ cowboy tactics , scaremongering and bullying ’ were being used by many private parking companies			1
‘ often motorists know that they are in the right but when they get a letter that looks like an official fixed penalty notice , followed by a letter that looks like an official bailiff ’s letter , they pay up because they are scared			1
’ he said that the @entity136 is paid for by the car parking industry , a situation akin to ‘ inmates guarding the jail ’			0
retired @entity142 superintendent @entity141 said : ‘ @entity143 do not have staff on site			0
rather they operate mobile patrols to rotate around a group of car parks			0
their operative will walk into the car park and issue a @entity153 or @entity154			0
‘ the @entity154 has all the appearance of a lawful @entity156 issued by the authorities			1
’ in 2012 , @entity158 was one of six firms that had their access to the @entity163 database of number plates , names and addresses suspended for a period for issuing misleading information to motorists			1
if people refuse to pay the penalty fee , the company passes the case on to a debt recovery firm such as @entity175 , of @entity176 in @entity177			1
wheel clamping on private land was made illegal two years ago following campaigns by the @entity52 and motoring groups			1
as a result , most companies switched to using parking penalty notices			0
but many are wrongly applied , leading to thousands of drivers being chased for money they do not owe			1
the notices are not backed by criminal law and can be enforced only in the civil courts			0
a driver in a private car park is deemed to have accepted the rules and terms , providing these are spelt out clearly on substantial signs that can easily be seen			1
if they stay longer than allowed , they are deemed to have agreed to meet the appropriate sanction which can be a £ 100 penalty , cut to £ 50 for swift payment			0
a driver hit with an unfair penalty can not be compelled to pay unless the company first gets an order from the @entity69			1
the firms rarely do this as it is too expensive			1
instead , they rely on threats of legal action			2
earlier this year , @entity210 was declared ‘ unfit ’ to hold a credit licence by the @entity212			0
its tactics include arranging for a solicitor ’s letter to be sent to the driver , generally adding more than £ 200 in charges			2
some of these were issued under the name of @entity221 in @entity222			2
last october , the @entity223 looked into the firm ’s practices and closed it down			0
it found there was ‘ reason to suspect dishonesty ’ on the part of an employee			0
@entity210 is appealing against the @entity212 ’s decision that it is ‘ unfit ’			0
incredibly , its managing director is @entity236 , who sits on the board of the @entity136 , which , in theory , is responsible for policing parking companies			0
@entity28 ’s said : ‘ all parking contractors that we work with are approved by the @entity136 and are required to meet strict standards which address appropriate levels of charges and behaviours demanded from staff			0
’ @entity158 insisted its staff issue penalty notices only when they have good evidence that a driver has stayed beyond the permitted time			0
chief executive @entity252 said : ‘ when we receive an appeal in respect of a charge notice that has been issued , we consider all the evidence provided , any mitigating circumstances and the decision process agreed in respect of each individual site with our clients			2
‘ should the motorist ’s appeal be unsuccessful we offer them the opportunity to appeal to @entity265 , the independent appeals service			0
’ @entity210 did not respond to requests for a comment			0
however , it issued a statement earlier this year saying : ‘ we have consistently provided the highest levels of service to our clients and their customers			2
’ an 80 - year - old diabetic was targeted by @entity28 ’s private parking wardens after suffering a medical emergency while parked at its outlet at @entity279			2
@entity280 , right with his daughter @entity281 , needed to wait at the restaurant longer than planned to ensure his blood sugar had stabilised before he could to drive on safely			0
two days later a parking penalty notice arrived from @entity158			0
it had captured the details of the car using automatic number plate recognition cameras and the official @entity163 database			2
after the firm was told about his condition it doubled the charge from £ 50 to £ 100 because it was not paid within 14 days			0
mr @entity280 , from @entity296 in @entity297 , had travelled to the airport last summer to pick up his daughter @entity281 , who owns the car			0
miss @entity300 , 54 , said : ‘ effectively , we were sent a £ 100 penalty for over-staying by just 16 minutes			0
’ the civil servant launched a successful appeal to the independent tribunal service @entity265 and the penalty was cancelled .			0

tickets doled out by private firms do not have official legal status
many are in fact issued unfairly and without the proper legal authority
@entity124 president @entity123 says many use ' scare tactics and bullying '
drivers can not be compelled to pay unless a court order is granted
