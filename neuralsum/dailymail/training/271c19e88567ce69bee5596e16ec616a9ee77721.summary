by @entity0 published : 09:17 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 09:28 est , 23 october 2012 a schizophrenic mass murderer who believes he is the ' prince of @entity2 ' will be executed in @entity3 tonight after an appeals court lifted a last - minute stay that was based on his mental illness			1
@entity9 , 64 , will be put to death by lethal injection at @entity12 at 6pm on tuesday , a @entity8 spokesperson confirmed			1
@entity9 has spent more than three decades on death row for eight brutal killings , including those of a teenage couple , in 1977 and 1978			1
he was originally due to be executed on october 16 , but it was delayed for a state judge to determine whether @entity9 was mentally competent to be put to death			1
life behind bars : @entity9 , 64 , has been on @entity22 for 34 years for killing eight people in the 1970s and will be put to death on tuesday			1
his lawyers argue that he is mentally ill after two days of testimony , including that from a panel of psychiatrists appointed by gov. @entity31 , the judge agreed @entity9 did understand why he was being executed			1
but on saturday , another @entity3 judge issued a stay as @entity9 's lawyers continued to argue he is mentally ill and therefore can not be executed			1
victim : he raped and shot @entity37 , 17 , as she went for ice cream with her boyfriend in january 1978			0
her boyfriend was also shot dead ' a man who thinks he is the immortal prince of @entity2 and who believes he is incarcerated because of a @entity44 plot quite clearly has no rational understanding of the effect of his looming execution and the reason for it , ' his lawyer , @entity40 , said in a statement			1
lawyers added it was a ' cruel and unusual punishment ' for a mentally ill man			1
yet now the @entity54 11th @entity53 in @entity55 have lifted the stay , ruling that @entity54 judge @entity57 ' abused ' his discretion on saturday when he issued it			2
@entity40 said he was disappointed the stay was lifted even though one of the three appeals judges was against it			1
he said he is hopeful the @entity62 will reverse the decision			0
' there is no evidence that mr. @entity9 has a rational understanding of the reason for , and effect of , his execution , ' he said			1
the lawyers argued that an inmate 's awareness of his execution - a standard set in 2007 - is not enough and the inmate must have a ' rational understanding ' - a higher standard than ' awareness '			1
his execution comes more than three decades after his horrific killing and raping spree in the 1970s			1
when @entity9 was 21 , he stole a deputy 's gun and was going to shoot when the deputy reached for another gun and shot the man four times - including once in the head			1
when he left hospital , ' he began to show serious mental instability , irrational thinking , unexplainable hostility and grossly impaired intelligence , ' his lawyers said			2
legal wrangling : the death has been granted after judges ruled he is aware of why he is being executed @entity9 was sentenced to death for eight killings in 1977 and 1978 , although some investigators believe he killed even more			2
may 1977 : an elderly couple who were in the area for a funeral were found beaten , tied up and shot dead in their motel room			0
the gun was used in @entity9 's later crimes but he was not charged as there was no other corroborating evidence			2
july 1977 : with three others , @entity9 broke into a house and tied up eight people and shot them in the heads			1
@entity112 , 33 , @entity113 , 24 , @entity114 , 35 , @entity115 , 26 , @entity116 , 37 , and @entity117 , 35 , all died			0
two survived : @entity118 , 45 , and @entity119 , 24			0
he was convicted of the killings			2
october 1977 : posing as a police officer , he shot two teenagers during an attempted robbery			0
january 1978 : shot and killed @entity125 , 17 , on his way to get ice cream with his girlfriend , @entity37			0
@entity37 , 17 , was raped and also shot			0
he was convicted of the killings			0
in may 1977 , an elderly couple who were in the area for a funeral were found beaten , tied up and shot dead in their motel room			0
while @entity9 was never convicted of these murders , the same handgun was used in a later crime of which he was found guilty			1
the crime was the slaying of the ' @entity139 ' in a home - invasion robbery in july 1977 - the worst mass murder in @entity143 history at the time			2
with two others , @entity9 entered a home under the guise of electrical worker and tied up eight people , aged between 24 and 45 , before shooting them in the heads			1
three months later , @entity9 posed as a police officer and shot two teenagers during an attempted robbery but again the couple survived			2
then in january 1978 , he shot and killed @entity125 , 17 , and @entity37 , 17 , as they stopped off at a lover 's lane on the way to get ice cream after leaving a @entity161 youth meeting			0
investigators said @entity9 had shot @entity125 in the head before chasing @entity37 from the car and raping her			2
she was found shot dead in a wooded area			0
detectives found that the gun used to kill the young couple had been stolen from the @entity170 home			0
four months after , police tracked down @entity9 and arrested him			2
six months later , he was found guilty in two separate cases of the six killings and the murder of the couple and sentenced to death			0
' he was a pretty vicious man , ' retired judge @entity177 , who put @entity179 on @entity22 in 1978 , told the @entity180			0
' we had pretty good information that he killed at least 12 people			0
' fate : @entity9 will be put to death in @entity12 by lethal injection at 6pm on tuesday over the years , @entity9 's lawyers have wrangled with the courts to throw out his death sentence , while two of his three 1977 accomplices have already been executed			1
in 1982 , the @entity3 @entity62 threw out the death sentence due to his mental illness , but the following year he was sentenced to death again - leading to years more of failed appeals			1
@entity196 , @entity37 's brother and only surviving relative , told the @entity180 that he is upset over years of delays , and saddened that his mother is no longer alive to witness the execution			2
' @entity200 is the fact that for 34 years , our tax dollars have been keeping @entity9 alive			1
free food , medical care and the ability to communicate with his loved ones and lawyers , ' he said			0
' my sister was brutally killed at the age of 17			0
her murder shattered our entire family			0
life was never the same			0
