but the amazing replica is not only for display as it is available to other plane enthusiasts , nervous flyers and even professional pilots to practice in			1
but it is not only for display as it is available to other plane enthusiasts , nervous flyers and even professional pilots to practice in inside the cockpit : luckily , miss @entity31 ( right ) does not have a problem with the lack of space in the bedroom mr @entity5 , who developed his aviation obsession as a child , said was forced to give up his wish to become a pilot as he was not good enough at mathematics			1
instead , he spent his time and money building the precise replica cockpit by hand - crafting it into the space he had in his spare bedroom at his two - bedroom home			1
the @entity7 has now ' flown ' at least 47,000 miles around the world - with mr @entity5 earning up to £ 3,000 a month			1

to look at @entity5 ’s house you would never guess there was a plane in the back room			2
' she added : ' i have n’t flown it myself as there are a lot of things to learn - i leave that to @entity5 as he is so passionate			2
' but i have sat in it a few times and every time i am just fascinated by the simulator , because it ’s so technical and intricate			0
' in order to build his pride and joy , mr @entity5 studied photographs of @entity7 cockpits online - and he managed to order most of the parts for the aircraft off the internet			2
the light deck panels are made out of @entity140 wood , while the pilot and two passenger chairs are made out of old leather car seats			1
he spent a large amount of his budget for the simulator on the electronics and high - tech equipment			2
popular : mr @entity5 said customers visited his house up to seven days a week - saying : ' the simulator is very popular and we often have couples come for the experience			2
' he added : ' it 's amazing how ladies respond to it ' there is an auto - pilot system and a six - foot screen with two 19inch monitors - creating the all - important panoramic view of the simulated landscape			1
' for me it is important to make the flight feel as lifelike as possible so i have invested in a great sound system with a subwoofer which vibrates so my passengers can get the experience of take - off and landing , ' he said			0
at work : mr @entity5 even uses his simulator to help people with a fear of flying , by letting them sit through a realistic flight experience mr @entity5 , who always wears his full pilot uniform when taking a flight , even carries out in - flight announcements telling passengers to ' fasten their seatbelts '			1
' my passengers can fly from @entity184 or @entity185 to @entity186 ’s @entity186 to on their first flight and then progress further afield to the @entity188 if they fancy , ' he said			0
' it does take a while to learn your way around the cockpit as there are 90 different switches and three sound systems			0
' it has taken me thousands of hours in man power to create this craft and even more in money , but i am pleased to now be earning a living from it			0
it ’s the best job in the world - after being a real pilot			0
' mr @entity5 even uses his simulator to help people with a fear of flying , by letting them sit through a realistic flight experience on his £ 125 two - hour flying awareness course			1
' the aim is to help people who are nervous about flying by letting them get used to the feel and sounds of a real plane , ' he said			0
' many customers want to browse my simulated airport database to find their holiday destination , and fly there on their own			0
' the cockpit 's software uses includes different landscapes from around the world , including the @entity223 and the @entity225 skyline - and mr @entity5 has a list of international airports that customers can fly to			1
