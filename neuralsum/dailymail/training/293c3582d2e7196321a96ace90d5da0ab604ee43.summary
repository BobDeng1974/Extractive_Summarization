by @entity1 reporter published : 07:47 est , 25 june 2013 updated : 03:42 est , 26 june 2013 @entity4 powers are outpacing the @entity5 to become the biggest spenders on defence by 2021 and are fuelling an ' explosion ' in the global arms trade , a study showed			0
the global arms trade jumped by 30 percent to $ 73.5 billion between 2008 - 2012 in spite of the economic downturn , driven by surging exports from @entity16 and demand from countries like @entity19 , and is set to more than double by 2020 , defence and security consultancy @entity10 's said on tuesday			2
' budgets are shifting @entity22 and global arms trade is increasing competition			1
this is the biggest explosion in trade the world has ever seen , ' said @entity28 , a senior manager at @entity30 's whose study looked at 34,000 defence acquisition programmes			0
weapons spending : @entity4 powers are outpacing the @entity5 to become the biggest spenders on defence by 2021 the @entity5 has accounted for the lion 's share of global defence spending over the past decade , but budget cuts in @entity38 , as it withdraws from countries such as @entity41 , mean that it will account for just 30 per cent by 2021 to fall behind @entity4 at 31 percent			2
military spending in the @entity43 - which includes @entity16 , @entity19 and @entity44 - will rise 35 percent to $ 501 billion in the next eight years , compared to a 28 per cent fall in @entity5 spending to $ 472 billion over the same period , @entity10 's said			1
' the big @entity48 defence companies have no option - export or shrink - but this could be sowing the seed of their own demise ; the opportunities in the @entity22 are a double - edged sword , fuelling a trend which threatens @entity5 dominance of defence			1
' said @entity58 , senior principal analyst at @entity30 's			0
@entity16 's ramp - up in defence spending in recent years is worrying its neighbours such as @entity62 , with whom it is currently embroiled in a stand - off over a series of uninhabited islands , despite its repeated reassurances that there is nothing to fear			1
@entity62 , as well as @entity19 and @entity70 , are among countries being courted by weapon makers such as @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 who want to sell them fighter jets and other equipment to make up for reduced spending in their @entity48 home markets , but such deals tend to require investment in the buyers 's defence industries			1
@entity90 aviation firm @entity89 , makers of the @entity88 fighter ( pictured ) are in talks with the @entity19 government over a $ 12 billion deal @entity19 , for instance , is speaking exclusively to @entity90 's @entity95 on a $ 12 billion order of 126 warplanes and wants 50 per cent of the work to be given to @entity19 companies			0
@entity16 is expected to increase its defence budget by 64 percent to $ 207 billion by 2021 , compared to @entity19 and @entity44 which are respectively forecast to spend 54 and 113 percent more , the study said			0
these countries aspire to build thriving defence industries capable of developing modern equipment such as fighter jets and aircraft carriers , and may be able to export ' world class kit ' rivalling that of the @entity108 in a decade as a result of their willingness to spend , @entity10 's said .			0

weapons *systems* built in the @entity22 could rival @entity48 - made devices within 10 years , experts believe
