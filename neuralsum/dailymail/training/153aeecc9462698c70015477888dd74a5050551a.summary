@entity0 has brought in a new treason law which opponents say @entity3 will use it to silence his critics @entity0 president @entity3 has signed a new treason law which opponents say could be used to smother dissent and put anyone who has contact with foreigners at risk			1
the law means @entity0 representing international organisations could be charged with treason			1
the maximum sentence for the offence is 20 years in prison			2
the law was published in the official government gazette yesterday , despite a promise by mr @entity3 on monday that he would review it			1
political opponents and rights activists say the legislation is the latest in a series of laws cracking down on the opposition and reducing foreign influence since mr @entity3 returned to the @entity28 in may for a six - year third term			1
‘ citizens recruited by international organisations acting against the country ’s interests will also be considered traitors , ’ the official gazette , @entity31 , said on its website			0
at a meeting of his human rights council on monday , mr @entity3 listened to a retired @entity41 judge ’s concerns about the legislation , which she said did not require authorities to prove a suspect damaged state security			0
mr @entity3 indicated that he would move cautiously , but also said ‘ nonetheless , i am ready to return to this again , to look more attentively ’			0
@entity0 officials have said the law is needed to help prevent foreign governments using organisations in @entity0 to gather state secrets			1
the legislation allows @entity0 representing international organisations to be charged with treason , as well as those working for foreign states and bodies , and expands the range of actions that can be considered treasonous			2
@entity3 signed the law on tuesday and it took effect on wednesday when it was published in the official gazette , @entity31 , despite a promise by the president on monday that he would review it			1
' it 's an attempt to return not just to @entity65 times but to the @entity67 era , when any conversation with a foreigner was seen as a potential threat to the state , ' said @entity72 , 85 , a former @entity65 dissident and veteran human rights activist			0
she said it would probably be used selectively against @entity28 critics and others ' who irritate the authorities '			2
political opponents and rights activists say the legislation is the latest in a series of laws intended to crack down on the opposition and reduce foreign influence since he returned to the @entity28 in may for a six - year , third term ( above ) @entity86 , a political analyst sympathetic with @entity88 protests this year , said the motivation behind the law was that ' the state is more important than its citizens , so there must be as much control over citizens as possible '			1
the law was backed by the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) , the main successor of the @entity98 , and landed on the desk of longtime @entity98 officer @entity3 after being approved by both houses of parliament in the space of nine days last month			1
the @entity96 , in a rare public comment , was quoted by state - run news agency @entity104 as saying the law had been updated after being unchanged since the 1960s because ' foreign intelligence agencies ' methods and tactics for gathering information have changed '			1
@entity3 whipped up anti- @entity111 sentiment during his campaign for the march presidential election , and @entity0 officials have said the law is needed to help prevent foreign governments using organisations in @entity0 to gather state secrets			1
' citizens recruited by international organisations acting against the country 's interests will also be considered traitors ' , @entity31 said in a commentary on its website			0
@entity3 has frequently accused @entity124 nations of seeking to undermine @entity0 's security and weaken the nuclear - armed nation , and has suggested they use non-governmental organisations to do so			0
@entity129 ordered the @entity130 to cease its @entity0 operations in october , accusing it of seeking to influence elections			2
in july , @entity3 signed a law requiring foreign - funded ngos deemed to be engaging in political activity to register as ' foreign agents ' , and critics say other legislation is also aimed at silencing opponents			1
the @entity111 and the @entity140 have criticised the laws , and expressed concern about criminal charges laid against several opposition leaders in the last few months			0
during his election campaign , @entity3 faced protests which at times drew tens of thousands of people into @entity129 's streets , and he accused the @entity111 of whipping up demonstrations against his rule			0
the maximum sentence for high treason remains 20 years , but the legislation signed by @entity3 also introduced prison terms of up to eight years for @entity0 acquiring state secrets in certain ways even if they are not passed on to foreigners			0
it broadened the spectrum of actions that can attract treason charges to include giving ' financial , material , technical , consultative or other aid ' to a government or organisation deemed to be seeking to undermine @entity0 security			0
those changes , as well as the removal of the stipulation that actions must be aimed against @entity0 's ' external ' security to be considered treasonous , have raised concerns the law could be applied broadly to punish government opponents			2
at a meeting of his human rights council on monday , @entity3 listened to a retired @entity41 judge 's concerns about the legislation , which she said did not require authorities to prove a suspect damaged state security			0
but although @entity3 said he would look again at the law , his spokesman said he had signed it a day later			2
' it 's not the first time @entity3 has said the right words while slowly tightening the screws , ' @entity72 said .			0
