by @entity1 reporter victim : @entity3 was shot dead by a border agent in 2010 a 15 - year - old boy shot dead by a border patrol agent was protected by the @entity9 @entity8 even though he was on @entity11 soil when he was shot , a federal appeals court ruled yesterday			1
the ruling from the 5th @entity13 means the family of @entity3 can move forward with a civil lawsuit against the agent			1
the @entity11 teenager was killed while he played with friends near a border bridge in 2010			1
' this recognizes human rights belong to everyone			0
not just @entity9 citizens , ' or people standing on @entity9 soil , said @entity26 , one of the lawyers representing the family			1
the original lawsuit was filed against the @entity30 , the @entity31 , @entity32 , agent @entity33 and the @entity9 @entity34			0
but part of the ruling relieves the agent 's supervisors and the agencies from responsibility			2
' the appellants [ do not point to ] any other evidence that would suggest that the supervisors were personally responsible for the alleged constitutional violation , ' the ruling says			2
@entity26 said the family will likely appeal that part of the ruling			1
both the government and @entity47 can also appeal the ruling			2
the @entity30 said it would not comment on the matter because it opens the possibility of litigation			0
warning : graphic content lawsuit : the family of 15 - year - old @entity3 , pictured above after he was shot , will be able to take legal action against the agent responsible for his death @entity33 's attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment from @entity1			1
@entity33 shot @entity61 in 2010 near a border bridge between @entity63 and @entity64 while trying to arrest immigrants who crossed illegally into the @entity9			1
@entity33 said he was attacked by stone throwers			0
@entity30 agents are allowed to shoot at stone throwers if they feel their lives or those in their custody are at risk			0
@entity9 district judge @entity73 found in 2011 that the family could not sue because the shooting 's effects were ' felt in @entity11 '			1
but the appeals court said that ' territorial approach ' would allow agents to establish ' zones of lawlessness '			0
it ' would establish a perverse rule that would treat differently two individuals subject to the same conduct merely because one managed to cross into our territory , ' the appeals court ruling says			2
reaction : protests over @entity3 's death and violence along the border were held in june 2010 it also says that giving people standing on @entity11 soil protection from ' conscience shocking ' actions by border agents , such as the shooting of @entity3 , is not a new policy			1
immigrants who are inside the @entity9 , even those who are to be removed from the country , ' are entitled to feel free of gross physical abuse by federal agents ' , it says			0
extending that right to people injured across the border by @entity9 agents standing on @entity9 soil , would inform the officials that they are not allowed to arbitrarily inflict harm in this ' new , but similar , context , ' the court said			0
' today the @entity114 helped ensure that @entity32 agents are held accountable for shocking and outrageous abuse , even when their victims are n't inside the @entity9 ... the @entity114 clearly signaled that @entity30 can not operate with impunity , ' @entity119 senior staff attorney @entity118 said in a statement			0
the @entity119 was not directly involved but filed a friend of the court brief in the case .			0

@entity126 died on the @entity11 side of the border in 2010
ruling means family of 15 - year - old victim can take legal action over shooting
