a wealthy property developer is being taken to court after refusing to tear down a giant £ 2,500 playhouse he built in his back garden for his children			0
@entity6 , 40 , and his wife @entity7 , 45 , erected the 12ft wooden playhouse in the grounds of their £ 800,000 home in the @entity13 village of @entity14 for their young daughters			1
when neighbours complained their properties were overlooked , they dismantled it and put it back up without a wooden platform , but they were told they were still in breach of planning law and had to take it down			0
@entity6 , @entity7 and daughters @entity26 , left , and @entity27 , in front of the controversial playhouse the property developers , pictured right with @entity26 , left , and @entity27 , bought the playhouse two years ago mr @entity6 says that he has complied with the issues raised at the start but believes the council ' wants a scalp ' the problem began two years ago when the @entity6 family bought the playhouse for their 300ft back garden			1
@entity41 complained the structure , which 11ft high , 19ft wide and 9ft deep , caused ' significant harm to the character and appearance of the area ' and ordered it to be removed			2
the couple complied and rebuilt the house without its wooden platform but were told it still breached planning law and given an enforcement notice ordering them to remove the playhouse , which consists of a swing set , slide and tree house			1
when the couple refused to comply , they refused they were ordered to @entity61 , where they denied breaching an enforcement notice			1
mr @entity6 told magistrates : ' the supplier @entity65 confirmed to us we did n’t need planning permission because the full height was under four metres and the planning officer said the same			1
' we proceeded on that basis and eight months went by			0
' it was only when neighbours began to criticise @entity41 for not doing their job well enough that the council looked into it again			0
' edge of the village : the family 's house is ringed , while the yellow dot indicates where the playhouse is the @entity84 family lives in an £ 800,000 stone house in the village of @entity14 , south of @entity61 mr @entity6 says the firm he bought the playhouse from in 2011 told him it did not require planning permission if they lose the case they could face a maximum £ 20,000 fine plus court costs and still be forced to rip the playhouse down			1
the couple claim they were told by planning officers during site visits that the platform was the only issue , but that after taking it apart , making several adjustments and reassembling it , the officers said they had still breached the enforcement notice			2
mr @entity6 , who lives has lived in the detached stone house since 2005 with his wife and their three children , @entity110 , 20 , @entity26 , 12 , and @entity27 , nine , said : ' we were assured by the company that the playhouse did not require planning permission and it was up for 11 months before someone complained to the council			1
' the platform was the floor of the little treehouse bit of the structure so to show good faith we took the floor out but now the council claim the ledge near the slide constitutes a platform			0
quite palatial : the £ 2,500 playhouse boasts a slide , climbing wall , swings , and an impressive treehouse ' a planning officer bizarrely told me one way to comply with planning law would be to build a large shed covering the playhouse to make it an indoor play area which did not need planning permission			0
' it ’s crazy because that would mean building something even bigger			0
' mr @entity6 added : ' in my view the council are desperate for a scalp and because we are property developers they have come after us and are using bully tactics to make us tear it down			1
' at the court hearing the council officers told me they would pursue the maximum £ 20,000 fine plus court costs			0
' i refuse to take this lying down and i will not be bullied so i am putting my money where my mouth is and will fight them because i know i am in the right			0
' a trial will take place in march next year at @entity161 ’ court			2
a spokesman for @entity41 said the construction of garden sheds , garages , tree houses , and play equipment was allowed without planning permission if they did n't have a balcony or raised platform over 300mm , had only a single storey , and if were more than two metres from a boundary if over 2.5m high			2
he said : ' the development in @entity14 did not comply with any of these criteria			2
' councillor @entity177 said : ' the council has consistently informed the applicant that the structure was unauthorised and required planning permission			0
' [ the council 's ] enforcement notice has not been complied with , despite repeated requests to do so and left the council with no other option but to prosecute the site owner			1

@entity6 , 40 , and his wife @entity7 , 45 , bought house in 2011
@entity192 complained so they adjusted it , but council says it 's too high
mr @entity6 , of @entity14 , @entity13 , says ' i wo n't take it lying down '
he says @entity200 is after him because he 's a developer
couple deny breaching an enforcement notice and will stand trial in march
