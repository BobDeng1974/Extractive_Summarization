@entity72 was cleared of raping @entity81 but convicted of having sex with a child at the end of the harrowing case , police and social workers apologised to the victims for failing to rescue them as it emerged that officers missed several chances to catch gang members before they were finally arrested			1
some victims relived their ordeals during the four - month trial , describing how they were groomed , beaten , betrayed and sold into prostitution around the country			2
one was still so frightened of her attackers that she refused to give evidence for fear of reprisals			0
it was only after she was given legal advice that girl @entity108 agreed to tell her story on a videolink from another room in the building			0

@entity128 ( left ) and @entity72 ( right ) have been convicted of offences involving underage girls @entity72 ( left ) and @entity72 ( right ) were among those convicted at the @entity18 last month the girls had been put into care because their behaviour was out of control and for their own protection			2
