mr @entity81 explained that a psychiatrist instructed by the defence would give evidence to say that @entity8 was suffering from a personality disorder that affected his mind at the time mr @entity10 died and therefore was guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility			1
' however , another psychiatrist , dr @entity210 , has provided a second opinion which contradicts that , ' mr @entity81 said			0

' it is dr @entity210 ’s opinion that this killing was simply revenge , rooted in anger and resentment and not as a result of mental illness or malfunction , so there is no lesser responsibility for this killing			0

' the prosecution case is that this is a clear and obvious case of murder and nothing else			0
