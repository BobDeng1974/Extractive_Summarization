data for the first 12 months of the @entity1 showed the £ 5billion initiative secured lasting employment for just one in every 50 people referred , at a cost of £ 14,000 a job			1
the scheme – personally championed by the prime minister – pays private sector firms such as @entity10 and @entity11 to find jobs for the long - term unemployed			1
but of the 785,360 people referred to the @entity1 in its first year , just 18,270 were found a lasting job – equal to just 2.3 per cent			1
champion : the back - to - work scheme is a flagship programme for the pm while employment minister @entity18 insisted it was still early days for the £ 5billion scheme officials at the @entity21 had estimated that 5 per cent would find jobs on their own if the scheme did not exist , and firms were set a minimum target of getting 5.5 per cent of ‘ clients ’ into work in the first year			1
employment minister @entity18 said last night it was ‘ early days ’ , and pointed out that the targets were set when economic growth forecasts were better			0
he added that more than 200,000 people had been found work of some sort , although in many cases this lasted only a few weeks or months			1
he said it was ‘ clearly ridiculous ’ to suggest that more people would have found jobs if the @entity1 had not existed			1
only 3.5 per cent of people referred to the @entity1 in its first year stayed off benefits and in a job spending on the programme so far totals £ 435million			1
providers can earn between £ 3,700 and £ 13,700 per person , depending how hard it is to help them , with an initial payment of £ 400 - £ 600			0
the main payments are only made after someone has been in work for six months – the government ’s definition of sustained employment			2
the figures reveal wide variations in the performance of the companies involved , but mr @entity18 said the worst had been warned they could be stripped of their contracts unless they upped their game by next april			0
@entity63 branded the scheme a ‘ miserable failure ’ , and shadow work and pensions secretary @entity65 said the figures revealed it was ‘ comprehensively failing ’			2
over 50s are forced to become their own boss @entity70 , chairman of the commons public accounts committee , said the initiative was falling ‘ woefully short of expectations ’			0
woefully short of expectation : chairman of the commons public accounts committee , @entity70 criticised the scheme she added : ‘ the success of this programme will be measured on getting people off unemployment benefit and into sustainable jobs who without the programme would not have found work			1
‘ there is little value to the taxpayer or society in having people sitting on a scheme for over two years			2
’ individuals are placed on the programme for two years , meaning a full assessment of it will not be possible for another 12 months			0
officials said the most recent figures , covering the scheme ’s first 14 months , suggested it was starting to take off , with the jobs rate improving slightly to 3.5 per cent			2
public concern over the programme erupted earlier this year when it emerged that @entity10 boss @entity103 had paid herself £ 8.6million last year , despite claims that the firm ’s record in finding jobs for the unemployed was ‘ abysmal ’			0
it also emerged that the firm was being investigated by the police over allegations of fraud			0
mrs @entity103 was forced to resign as the company ’s chairman and quit her role as mr @entity117 ’s ‘ back to work ’ tsar in the resulting row , although she remains the main shareholder in @entity10 .			0

the @entity1 pays companies and *charities* if they get long - term unemployed into a job
officials thought 5 **%** of people would find work on their own - more than the 3.5 **%** helped by the scheme
200,000 have been found some work but many last just a few weeks before going back on benefits
two in three workers over 50 plan to work beyond the state pension age – most of them women , a report reveals today .
the *majority* say they can not *afford* to retire and on average expect to work an extra six years .
the report found *6.5million* of the *9.9million* workers over 50 do not plan to retire at the state pension age . of these , *4.1million* are women , compared with *2.4million* men .
the study , by the **retirement** *specialist* @entity152 , *highlights* the social impact of the pensions crisis as gold - plated schemes , which guarantee a *comfortable* **retirement** , have all but *vanished* .
