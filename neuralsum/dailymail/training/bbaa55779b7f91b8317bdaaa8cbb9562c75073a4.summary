pope @entity0 in @entity1 's square today : he has announced a probe into the activities of the highly secretive and scandal - tainted @entity4 pope @entity0 ordered an inquiry into the activities of the @entity9 bank today , after fresh accusations of corruption and continued questions about its secrecy			1
@entity0 named a commission to investigate the bank 's legal structure and activities ' to allow for a better harmonization with the universal mission of the @entity21 , ' according to the legal document that created it			2
the announcement came after prosecutors in @entity26 placed senior @entity28 official monsignor @entity27 under investigation for alleged money - laundering			1
@entity27 has said he did nothing wrong , though in an interview with the local daily , @entity26 , he acknowledged he received bad advice from his accountant			0
the five - member commission includes two @entity38 : monsignor @entity39 , a top official in the @entity9 secretariat of state , and @entity42 , a @entity43 law professor , former @entity38 ambassador to the @entity9 and current president of a pontifical academy			2
@entity38 cardinals were among the most vocal in demanding a wholesale reform of the @entity9 bureaucracy - and the @entity9 bank - in the meetings running up to the @entity52 that elected @entity0 pope			1
the demands were raised following revelations in leaked documents last year that told of dysfunction , petty turf wars and allegations of corruption in the @entity9 's governance			1
it was the second time in as many weeks that @entity0 has intervened to get information out of the @entity4 , or @entity4			0
on june 15 , he filled a key vacancy in the bank 's governing structure , tapping a trusted prelate to be his eyes inside the bank			2
@entity0 , who has made clear he wants a ' poor ' church , has already named a separate commission of cardinals to advise him on the broader question of reforming the @entity28 bureaucracy as a whole			0
the @entity9 bank was founded in 1942 by pope @entity76 to manage assets destined for religious or charitable works			1
located in a tower just inside the gates of @entity28 , it also manages the pension system for the @entity9 's thousands of employees			2
@entity28 at dusk : @entity0 , who has made clear he wants a ' poor ' church , has already named a separate commission of cardinals to advise him on the broader question of reforming the @entity9 bureaucracy as a whole the bank commission 's members have the authority to gather documents , data and information about the bank 's legal status and activities , even overriding normal secrecy rules to do so			1
members can receive information from anyone in the @entity9 bureaucracy as well as people who spontaneously volunteer information , and the commission can refer to outside advisers if necessary , according to the terms			2
the bank 's administration continues to function as normal , as does the @entity9 's new financial watchdog agency which has supervisory control over it			1
the commission will report back to @entity0 - presumably with both information and recommendations - and then will be dissolved , the document states			0
no timeframe was given but the commission is to start working soon			0
involved with the @entity4 : @entity119 , the head of @entity120 , was found hanging from @entity121 in @entity122 in 1982 @entity9 spokesman rev. @entity123 , confirmed today that @entity27 had been suspended temporarily from his position in one of the @entity9 's key finance offices , the @entity127 for the patrimony of the @entity21			2
@entity130 daily @entity129 reported over the weekend that @entity130 's central bank had asked the @entity9 's financial watchdog agency for information about @entity27 's @entity9 bank account as part of the probe			1
mr @entity123 said he did n't know if the @entity9 had responded to the request			0
there have long been questions about just what the @entity4 actually is and does - questions which the commission presumably will try to iron out for @entity0			0
@entity9 officials have long insisted it 's not even a bank , since it does n't perform key banking activities like making loans			1
it does however take deposits , transfer money and invest for its clients , performing asset management services that in 2012 helped earn it 86.6 million euros in profit on 7.1 billion euros in total assets under management			0
some cardinals have questioned if the @entity9 needs such a financial institution and whether its activities are even in keeping with church teaching			0
the @entity9 bank 's workings have long been shrouded in secrecy			1
most famously , it was implicated in a scandal over the collapse of @entity130 's @entity120 in the 1980s in one of @entity130 's largest fraud cases			0
@entity119 , the head of @entity120 , was found hanging from @entity121 in @entity122 in 1982 in circumstances that remain mysterious .			0

comes as @entity9 official placed under investigation for money laundering
previous leaks revealed dysfunction , turf wars and alleged corruption
the @entity9 bank 's workings have long been shrouded in secrecy
