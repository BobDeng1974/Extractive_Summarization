@entity0 has suggested @entity1 is poised for a dramatic change should a number of cash - strapped teams go to the wall over the winter			1
the likes of @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 are currently teetering on the brink of extinction as a result of rising , unchecked costs associated with running their teams			1
to that extent , plans have been aired at recent meetings with regard to the prospect of eight , three - car teams being on the grid in 2015			1
@entity0 has suggested three - car teams should a number of cash - strapped teams go to the wall speaking at a promotional event in @entity28 ahead of this weekend 's race around the @entity30 , @entity0 said : ' it has always been on the cards if we lose up to three teams the others will run three cars			1
' i think we should do it anyway			0
i would rather see @entity39 with three cars , or any of the other top teams with three cars , than having teams that are struggling			2
' asked whether such a concept could happen next year , @entity0 added : ' we 'll know after the next two or three races , but it is being looked at			1
' one suggestion is for the back - of - the - grid teams to be provided with financial assistance to overcome their current difficulties			1
but as @entity0 states , it has been the way of @entity1 over the years that teams have come and gone - many for financial reasons			1
' i 've been around - most people would say too long - but long enough to know there are always people at the back of the grid , ' remarked the 83 - year - old			2
' the trouble with the teams - which is all normal - they think of themselves short term			1
' you ask about next year , but they 're worried about the next race , which is the problem			0
' @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 are currently teetering on the brink of extinction because of costs another issue for @entity0 to resolve is whether to continue with the controversial double - points system for the final race of a year			1
the season - ending @entity73 in november will serve as the acid test of whether the concept loathed by the majority of fans has worked			1
successful or not , though , it could be the system is axed regardless			0
@entity0 added : ' i wanted it ( double points ) to be for the last three races			1
' then people would believe it still possible somebody else could win , but everyone said i was mad , so we wo n't do it			0
' as for keeping it for the last race , i do n't know			0
we ca n't yet see whether it has worked , it depends			0
' it just seemed to me the right way to keep the championship open , otherwise for the last three or four races people are running in non-championship races			0
' @entity0 , meanwhile , has suggested more measures may be taken to make a driver 's life more difficult over the course of a grand prix weekend			2
@entity0 's remarks follow a suggestion of his coming into force from this weekend 's race - the banning of certain types of radio messages			1
commercial supremo @entity0 talks to former @entity1 driver @entity111 on thursday asked whether he was in favour of the ban , @entity0 smiled and then replied : ' as i was the one who started it off , yes			2
' suggested it was imperative drivers do more rather than continually relying on information from the pit wall , @entity0 added : ' i think none of the drivers want it ( radio )			2
they are all happy it has gone			0
' they drive the cars , they should know what is wrong or right			0
they do n't need someone on the pit wall telling them what to do			0
' we have a regulation in force drivers must drive the car unaided			2
they have been aided - and still are			0
' even if we get rid of this ' ship to shore ' as i call it , there are still a lot of aids that they should not have			0
' driving is still not easy , but it was easier than it was			0
' asked whether more rule changes would come into effect , @entity0 replied : ' i think we might ... to make their life more difficult .			2
