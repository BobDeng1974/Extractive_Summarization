the @entity1 administration dramatically moved @entity3 's second - year goalposts on monday , saying that it expected no more than 9.9 million @entity4 to be enrolled in medical insurance through a government - managed system by the end of march			1
the @entity9 , a nonpartisan organization that advises federal legislators , assumed that the number would be a much higher 13 million in april , when it built the financial projections under - girding the law 's implementation			1
now the number could be as low as nine million			0
@entity16 ( @entity16 ) secretary @entity15 said monday that her goal is 9.1 million			1
that number could go lower still , if less than 83 per cent of current @entity3 enrollees – 5.9 million people in all – renew their coverage in 2015			1
the news came just days after the @entity22 said it would hear a case that could collapse the @entity3 system 's financial structure			1
the administration had said it enrolled 7.3 million , but many of those people were unable to complete @entity46 total 112,000 people could n't establish their citizenship or immigration status , which is required to qualify			1
the overall lower estimates for the 2014 - 2015 enrollment period stems from a two - year slower than expected shift to the government system by @entity4 who have their own insurance			1
' that 's been much lower than the predictions , ' hhs secretary @entity15 told an audience at the liberal @entity33 on monday			1
she also revealed that ' we 've been writing letters ' to ' folks who might come off the system , ' in order to keep them in the fold next year			0
@entity1 , both before and during his presidency , famously promised that @entity4 who wanted to keep their health plans would be able to			0
now , however , maintaining @entity3 's solvency appears to depend on moving ever - more people away from the insurance they previously had outside government marketplaces			1
in addition , 120,000 @entity4 households can expect to see their insurance costs increase on dec. 1 of this year because when they signed up , they provided insufficient information about their incomes			2
when those numbers are recalculated , the portion of their premiums that taxpayers subsidize could shrink or disappear			0
fingers crossed : a year ago @entity80 was a mess of historic proportions , but @entity15 says her agency has increased the length of its software testing period by 350 per cent @entity16 officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , told reporters during a monday conference call that the @entity9 had assumed there would be ' significant shifts over three years ' from people in employer - provided insurance and individual plans			1
but new data show ' there is considerable uncertainty that a large shift will occur over the new two years , ' according to a new @entity16 report			0
but ' i would n't characterize it as an error , ' an official said during the conference call			0
' we think the evidence points to a longer ramp - up rate than the @entity9 projections had , and that is based on what we 've learned over the last year from looking at our own data			1
' the @entity22 case that justices agreed this weekend to hear will hinge on a single line in the law 's text			2
at issue is whether the federal government is permitted to pay subsidies for insurance policies bought through its own @entity80 website			0
the @entity3 provided a mechanism for those taxpayer subsidies , but a literal reading of the words only allows the payments for policies brokered by states			0
thirty - six states fall outside that group			0
@entity15 said monday that the @entity131 will ultimately prevail because @entity132 intended to make everyone eligible for subsidies – regardless of what it wrote and passed into law			2
' nothing has changed , ' she said , telling @entity4 that they should n't worry about whether their subsidies will be available in future years			2
' the tax credits that they 'll be signing up for , and the ones that they have , will be continuing			0
' @entity15 insisted on monday that the @entity1 administration will win a second @entity3 challenge in the @entity22 ' we believe that the law stated that the tax credits are an important part of affordable health care coverage – and that is for all , ' @entity15 added			1
' we believe that that was the intention of the law , and believe that is where we will stay , and be			0
' without the subsidy payments , @entity3 's financial structure would collapse as lower - income @entity4 would see their out - of - pocket premiums skyrocket			1
despite all the @entity3 's growing pains – a non-fuctioning website 12 months ago , high deductibles and a flood of doctors away from serving @entity3 patients among them – @entity15 threw the gauntlet down at the feet of a newly emboldened @entity168 @entity167 majority			2
' the repeal of the @entity3 is not something that this administration will let happen , ' she vowed			2
asked how sure she was that the website would perform as advertised this time around , @entity15 relied on numbers			0
' last year our testing was 10 days , ' she said			0
' this year our testing is five weeks			0

@entity9 projected 13 million signups by march 31 , 2015
now @entity16 secretary @entity15 says her goal is 9.1 million , but that number depends on keeping 5.9 million of last year 's enrollees
about 112,000 people lost coverage since the end of the last open enrollment period because they could n't prove they were @entity4 citizens or legal residents
@entity191 's own projections could fall apart if more than *17* per cent of 2013 - 2014 enrollees drop their coverage in year two
@entity15 said monday that the @entity131 will win the second @entity22 challenge to @entity3
a repeal is ' not something that this administration will let happen ' - @entity15
