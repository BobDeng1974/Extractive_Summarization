there have been times this season when @entity3 has left his stamp on a game			1
this @entity7 semi-final was no exception			1
the goals , 17 of them so far in a @entity11 shirt , are a welcome distraction from an altogether different side to the forward ’s game			1
this was a right old tear up , all blood and guts as these two teams took their rivalry , started by @entity23 ’s ghost goal in the @entity25 semi-final in 2005 , to another level			2
@entity3 of @entity11 stamps on @entity28 of @entity29 during the first - half at @entity31 @entity11 striker was lucky to avoid punishment for this stamp on @entity29 defender @entity35 it turned into a ‘ he - started - it ’ debate between the two managers at the end of this bruising second leg , but @entity3 is always picking a fight with somebody			1
these teams spat and snarled at each other all night , kicking off when @entity3 left his studs in the ankle of @entity35 after they clashed by the touchline			1
for that he should have been sent off			2
then there was the moment in extra-time , 102 minutes in when he wrapped his arms around the body of @entity29 captain @entity56 on the edge of their penalty area			1
@entity56 exploded , shoving his head into the face of @entity3 as players from both teams converged in yet another unfortunate scuffle			1
@entity65 escaped with a caution , as did the @entity11 forward			1
the feisty encounter saw many instances of confrontation like this between @entity56 and @entity3 this game , brilliantly poised at 1 - 1 following the first leg , was way too big for referee @entity73			1
he was way out of his depth			0
radio five analyst @entity75 repeatedly called him ‘ a bottler ’ , referencing his failure to award @entity11 a penalty when @entity28 clearly fouled @entity3 in the first half			1
@entity81 went potty , laying in to @entity82 , the fourth official , with another verbal battering and waiting for @entity73 in the tunnel at the end of the first half			2
this is not the way to lodge a complaint , but @entity81 was at his petulant worst down there at times			0
@entity11 manager @entity81 argues with referee @entity73 at @entity31 on tuesday @entity29 manager @entity91 tells opposition boss @entity81 to calm down on tuesday ‘ if i speak , people will say it ’s @entity81 , ’ claimed @entity11 ’s manager			1
‘ if i speak the @entity94 will try to punish me like they always do , or try			0
but it ’s clear when we win the game i still have to ask why			0
’ with apologies to former @entity101 manager @entity100 for unashamedly appropriating a phrase he used about his 1988 @entity104 winners , @entity11 ’s bench is the most badly behaved comprehensive in the country			2
they are an unruly bunch , constantly screaming in the face of @entity82 or jumping up and down in the technical area when decisions do not go their way			0
live with it , guys			0
we are used to it with @entity81 and the irritating figure of his @entity118 @entity117 alongside him , but it is not becoming of @entity11 ’s assistant coach @entity120			2
he is better than that			0
it is a credit to the any opposition manager - and @entity91 is included in this - if they can keep their cool when they are standing a yard or so away from @entity11 ’s bench			1
@entity28 of @entity29 argues with @entity3 of @entity11 , as the pair continually clashed on tuesday night the provocation and antagonism is unreal at times , a test of patience for any one having to the put up with the constant chirping in the ear of the fourth official			1
they make anybody want to blow			0
the bell inside @entity81 ’s head went again in the second half when @entity73 should have booked @entity144 for a second time when he deliberately handled			2
in @entity148 , for example , it is a caution			0
there was needle all over the pitch , with @entity152 setting the tone when he clattered into @entity154 as early as the eighth minute			0
the @entity11 midfielder was a passenger after that , finally succumbing just moments into the second half when he collided with his captain @entity158			1
@entity3 infuriated the @entity29 players after this blatant stamp on @entity29 's @entity35 in the first - half @entity152 was a lucky boy and @entity81 missed @entity11 ’s goal , scored by @entity163 ( another player booked for tugging @entity166 ’s shirt ) because he was still rabbiting in @entity82 ’s ear			1
he felt that @entity152 should have been sent off for clogging @entity168 and he was probably right			0
in the end they scored in any event			0
‘ i was telling @entity82 that @entity152 and @entity144 should have been sent off already for two yellow cards , ’ admitted @entity81			0
he was right , but this was a game when the sparks were flying between these two teams again			0
the rivalry is back on			0
‘ @entity3 is an outstanding footballer but he has an edge to him , ’ admitted @entity91			2
‘ you can see the incident with can and he puts his studs on his ankle and it could have been nasty			0
the one with @entity28 , again , there is no need and he is clever enough if the officials do n’t see it			0
’ as ever , it was @entity3 who left his mark			2
the @entity11 bench erupts into celebration at the final whistle after beating @entity29 in extra-time			1

@entity11 beat @entity29 1 - 0 in the @entity7 semi-final second leg
@entity200 *pundits* @entity201 and @entity202 both insist @entity3 should have been sent off for first - half stamp on @entity35
@entity163 's extra-time header sent @entity11 into the final
