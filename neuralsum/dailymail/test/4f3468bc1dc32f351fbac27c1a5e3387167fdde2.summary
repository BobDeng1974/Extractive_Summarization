the stylist behind singer @entity2 's unique , over-the - top hairstyles has revealed how much work the chart - topper has to put into ensuring her blonde locks remain totally healthy			1
@entity6 , who has been working with natural brunette @entity2 , 24 , for the past two years , confessed to @entity8 that her demanding haircare routine does require a hefty amount of work and ' maintenance '			1
' we have to color the hair every three weeks , ' he explained			2
' we 've managed to get the timing perfect so that she 's not coloring it all the time			2
' i 'm so strict with @entity2 , i want to make sure that her hair always looks great , and that means a lot of work			2
when she has any spare time , i make her condition			0
' but despite the seemingly endless hours of maintenance required in order to keep @entity2 's barnet looking its best , @entity6 insists that the singer is n't planning to follow in @entity47 's footsteps and make a change to brunette any time soon			1
' @entity49 is such a statement , despite the fact that it 's a lot of maintenance behind the scenes , ' he said			2
' we 've never done anything deep or dark and we change the actual style so much that i 'm eager to keep the color consistent			0
' the singer did have a chance to experiment with a darker hairstyle when she appeared in the recently - released @entity62 movie however ; @entity2 's role as @entity64 , the younger sister of charismatic businessman @entity65 , saw her don an extremely short , dark wig , which @entity6 believes helped @entity2 to separate herself from the character			1
innovation : every hairstyle that @entity2 models has something unique and different about it			2
' i always want to do something to make her hair look special , ' @entity6 explains the girl with the pearl ... hair : this embellished hairstyle is one of @entity6 ' favorites ' it worked for the film , because she was n't @entity2 , she was @entity85 , and i think that was a good thing , ' @entity6 said			1
' but i do n't know if it 's a style we will be trying out on @entity2 in real life ! ' while @entity2 might not be planning to replicate @entity64 's severe hairstyle any time soon however , @entity6 says that she is certainly not averse to experimenting with a variety of different looks - be they temporary , or permanent			1
indeed , the decision to cut @entity2 's hair into a much shorter style just a few months ago was actually made on a whim , during a late - night styling session			1
' i was talking to @entity2 about chopping her hair for a year , but it was about finding the right time , ' he explained			1
' then at two in the morning , i was working on her hair , and we 'd been doing it for hours , and she just said : " i think it 's time			0
" ' she called me the next day and was so happy with it , which was great			0
and it looks amazing , it was just a bit weird that we decided to do it then and there so late at night , or early in the morning i guess			0
' @entity112 : according to @entity6 , singer @entity113 recreated two of @entity2 's hairstyles for her this is how we do video something different : for her role as @entity85 in the recently - released movie @entity62 , @entity2 had the chance to experiment with darker locks and beyond the length and color of @entity2 's hair , @entity6 is determined to ensure that her style is always fresh , unique and interesting , and is often experimenting with different textures , embellishments and colorful accessories			1
' sometimes i get a lot of time to work on a look - i 'll know what outfit she 's planning to wear for a red carpet , or an appearance , and i can plan accordingly , ' he explained			1
' other times , i do n't really get any time at all and i just have to pull it out of the bag ! ' but i always want to do something to make her hair look special ; if she 's wearing a really detailed dress and we want the hair to be more simple , i 'll do something really subtle - like the gold leaf that we used in her parting at the @entity147			2
' but if we want to go all out , then we 'll work with loads of different accessories , or colors			0
i loved when we sewed loads of pearls into her hair , i thought that looked amazing			0
and it was so different and unique			0
' ' it 's all about the details - i â€™m all about adding details to the hair			0
people will watch , [ so ] make it worthwhile			0
' put a ring on it : @entity6 and @entity2 will often work together in order to come up with a new and unique way of accessorizing her hairstyle twisted : @entity2 often showcases @entity6 ' work on her @entity167 account while @entity6 admits that he and @entity2 do n't always see eye - to - eye about what hairstyle they should go for , he adds that she is always willing to go the extra mile in order to create something that is totally unique			1
and it seems that the seemingly endless hours @entity2 and @entity6 have spent working on maintaining and perfecting her varied hairstyles have more than paid off , with many of the more elaborate styles inspiring numerous other celebrities and style icons to create similar looks			1
' the people behind the new star wars movie loved the hair we created for the @entity186 version of @entity187 [ on which @entity2 is a judge ] so much that they are going to use it in their next film , ' @entity6 revealed			2
' @entity113 also did a similar style to the gelled baby hair that @entity2 had at @entity193 for her this is how we do video			0
' the same look was also used at a number of fashion shows including @entity198 and @entity199			0
' ' @entity6 is incredibly talented , ' @entity2 says of her ongoing relationship with the hairstylist			1
' we work so well together drawing inspiration from any number of things - from @entity206 to @entity208 street fashion			0
@entity6 is always up for creating real moments , trying something different while keeping me smiling the whole way			0

hairstylist @entity6 explained the inspiration for 24 - year - old @entity2 's unique and over-the - top hairstyles
he confessed that her blonde mane requires a lot of ' maintenance ' and has to be bleached every three weeks
unlike @entity47 however , @entity6 does n't believe @entity2 will be going back to brunette any time soon
