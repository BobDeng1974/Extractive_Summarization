@entity0 has credited the return to form which has seen him recalled to the @entity4 squad down to the influence of @entity7 manager @entity6			1
the midfielder , hailed by sir @entity9 last year as the best @entity11 player in the game , has won countless club trophies but struggled for consistency at international level throughout his career			1
now 33 years old , he is one of the oldest heads in @entity19 ’s squad and is a strong contender for a place at the bottom of the midfield diamond the @entity4 manager so often prefers to deploy			1
@entity0 is happy to be back in the @entity4 squad and has credited his return to @entity6 @entity0 had particular praise for the @entity7 manager 's aura and straightforward nature ‘ @entity6 has improved me , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ certain situations in games , he 's helped , not just individually but as a unit , as a defensive unit , as a group of players			1
i 've definitely learnt from him			0
‘ he 's been great from the start for me			2
i could n't ask for any more from him in terms of what he 's given me , and the support and confidence to be a big part of the team			2
‘ a lot of people at the top of their field , whether it 's business or sport , tend to have that aura , and he 's certainly got that belief and clarity in what he wants and what he expects from players			1
' he 's really straightforward and honest			1
‘ what you guys see when he speaks publicly , he 's exactly the same with us			2
he 's straight down the line and honest and says it exactly as it is			2
’ @entity6 puts an arm around @entity0 after they helped @entity7 to victory against @entity64 at @entity65 @entity0 says he could n't ask for any more from @entity6 in terms of support and confidence he has given @entity0 is still yearning to improve his game further , despite moving into the twilight of his career , and tries to learn from the very best in his role			1
‘ you can look at a few – @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , ’ he said			0
‘ @entity78 probably does n’t get enough credit for what he brings to @entity81			0
there ’re a few out there			0
‘ i thought @entity84 and @entity85 for @entity86 against @entity87 were terrific , especially when they went down to 10 men			0
i like watching and still trying to learn from others			2
’ @entity0 has also gained his footballing education alongside one of the midfield masters in @entity94 , and their former @entity7 team - mate and @entity4 coach @entity95 compared the pair to ‘ going into a bar and hearing a piano playing ’ due to the calm they brought to the midfield together			1
@entity76 was the first name mentioned by @entity0 in terms of midfielders around @entity106 he looks up to @entity77 ( right ) was also mentioned , as well as @entity78 in midfielder for @entity81 @entity0 felt @entity84 ( bottom ) did a brilliant job for @entity86 against @entity87 in @entity106 ‘ it made me laugh , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ i can see @entity111 saying that , but it was quite nice in a way			0
playing alongside @entity94 i learned so much			0
he ’d take the ball anywhere , he ’d put his foot on the ball and try to have influence on the game			0
‘ it is a lot about your personality , as a person , as a player , that is how i am really , quite quiet and understated , it suits me			0
’ @entity95 ( centre ) compared @entity0 's calmness to ‘ going into a bar and hearing a piano playing ’ @entity0 has become a key part of @entity7 's side as they look to secure a place in the @entity135 top four in the absence of @entity138 and @entity139 , @entity4 ’s midfield is crying out for an experienced head in the middle and @entity0 , if he can stay injury free , is eyeing @entity143 2016 as his tournament			1
’ that ’s definitely what i ’m striving towards , ’ he added			0
‘ i ’ d love to have another real crack at it			0
trying to have a bigger influence in the team is the target			0
