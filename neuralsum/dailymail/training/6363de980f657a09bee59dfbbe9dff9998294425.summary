by @entity0 @entity2 ’s position at the head of @entity5 team has been usurped by @entity6 , the marque ’s legendary former team principal , in a coup d’etat			1
it was announced on thursday that @entity6 has taken over as group chief executive – the most senior position @entity2 held , in addition to his title of team principal			1
@entity6 will conduct a root - and - branch investigation into the team ’s failure to finish on the podium last season			2
former glory : @entity6 , returning as @entity22 ceo , oversaw @entity24 's title triumph in 2008 end of the road : @entity2 , here with @entity27 and @entity28 , is facing the axe @entity30 understands that @entity6 ’s decision on who will be team principal for the 2014 season will be announced next month ahead of the first race in @entity35 on march 16			1
it is probable that @entity2 will be replaced , possibly moving sideways within the business			2
in what may have spelt out @entity2 ’s fate , @entity6 told the team at their @entity42 headquarters in thursday that ‘ there will be changes ’ and that ‘ we will win again ’			1
his 20 - minute speech was met with prolonged applause			1
perhaps tellingly , @entity2 was not in attendance , unlike other senior staff			0
it is not thought @entity6 will take over as team principal himself , given that he has a wider brief not only as chief executive now but in remaining as chairman of @entity55			1
@entity56 , who left @entity57 in november , is among the leading contenders having spoken to @entity6 – a one - time adversary – at a shoot at the end of last year			2
there now appears no personal animus between the two giants of the sport to prevent such a move			0
time 's up : @entity2 's future as team principal appears untenable following the return of @entity6 centre of attention : @entity6 is back in the spotlight ' my fellow shareholders have mandated me to write an exciting new chapter in the story of @entity5 , beginning by improving our on - track and off - track performance , said @entity6			1
' over the coming weeks i intend to undertake a thorough and objective review of each of our businesses with the intention of optimising every aspect of our existing operations , whilst identifying new areas of growth that capitalise on our technologies , and where appropriate further investing in them			0
' during february , i will articulate a new @entity22 strategy and implement the organisational structure best suited to achieving it			0
i am excited by the prospect of returning to the role of group chief executive officer and working with my many colleagues and fellow shareholders to fulfil our objective – which is to win at whatever we do			0
' @entity6 , 66 , has long wished to shake - up the @entity5 side of the business but met objection within the board			2
they were , at times , keen instead to restrain @entity6 , whom they blamed for the failure of the road car side of the business			0
those problems have since been rectified and his position is secure			0
it is understood that he board ’s composition remains unchanged .			0

@entity6 has replaced @entity2 as ceo of the @entity22
@entity2 , who oversaw one of @entity5 's worst - ever seasons last year , is likely to be replaced as team principal before the opening race on march 16
@entity6 said @entity5 ' will win again ' during a 20 - minute speech at @entity42
it is *n't* *believed* that @entity6 will take over as @entity5 team principal
