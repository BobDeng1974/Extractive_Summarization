@entity0 has donated $ 100,000 to the @entity1 for @entity2 everyone knows that a hair and make - up team are always on standby on a film set , but some stars need it more than others			1
@entity0 is certainly in need of regular touch - ups for her latest role and was spotted being pampered on the set of @entity14 in @entity15 today			1
the 37 - year - old has taken on the role of evil @entity18 in an adaptation of @entity20 and to do so , she has undergone something of a transformation			2
playing the part well : @entity0 certainly appeared to be in character as @entity14 as she wandered across the grass on the first day of shooting of the new @entity28 movie how do i look ? @entity0 speaks with a make - up artist on her first day on the @entity14 movie set @entity0 was seen in the middle of a field today in full costume as she continued to film scenes for the upcoming @entity28 movie			1
wearing a long brown cape and black horns , the actress was spied having her make - up retouched by a female artist while a male member of the crew dealt with her long brunette hair			2
it was only yesterday that fans got a sneak peek of @entity0 's character and what they can expect from the fairytale film			1
transformation : the actress was wearing a long brown cape and black horns as she stood in the middle of a field time for a touch up : @entity0 has her hair and make - up seen to as she continues to film @entity28 film @entity14 working their magic : a female make - up artist was seen applying a product to @entity0 's face while her long hair was held back wearing a leather horned headdress , and yellowed contacts , the actress was also given a bit of help in the cheek department with the addition of some @entity74 - style cheek prosthetics			1
@entity0 plays the title role in the updated version of @entity28 's 1959 animated feature @entity20 and of her costuming she said : ' we ’re experimenting with different things			1
but the horns are the horns — you ca n’t deny them			2
you have to have horns			0
' enjoying herself : the @entity87 star shared a joke with the crew in between takes double take : @entity0 was surrounded by cattle as she shot her scenes and a lookalike was also on set getting into the role : @entity0 looked in good spirits on the set , despite a long day of filming what 's so funny ? @entity0 shared a joke with the crew as she headed back to do another take of one particular scene in this updated version , the focus of the film centres on the events that hardened @entity14 's heart , leading her to curse the @entity109 ( @entity20 ) , played by @entity110			1
@entity0 told @entity111 : ' it ’s not anti-princess , but it ’s the first time they ’re looking at this epic woman			1
' i hope in the end you see a woman who is capable of being many things , and just because she protects herself and is aggressive , it does n’t mean she ca n’t have other [ warmer ] qualities ' impressive : @entity0 wore a full - skirted dress underneath a huge coat for the scenes heading into the light : two huge studio lights were shone on @entity0 as the natural light began to fade on the set of the film as a woman who is used to dividing opinion , @entity0 was clearly attracted to taking on such a ' imperfect ' character			1
she said : ' it sounds really crazy to say that there will be something that ’s good for young girls in this , because it sounds like you ’re saying they should be a villain			0
[ @entity14 ] is actually a great person			0
but she ’s not perfect			0
she ’s far from perfect			0
' @entity0 was seen taking her family to see musical wicked based on the novel by @entity145 while in @entity146 , which similarly tells the story of the @entity148 before she turns bad			1
@entity0 's look for @entity18 takes inspiration from pop singer @entity74 with her cheekbone prosthetics evil : @entity0 will play @entity14 , the wicked sorceress from @entity28 's 1959 animation of the classic fairytale @entity20 ' in general , it ’s a very good message to say , “ let ’s look at something from the other side			1
” but then also , what our challenge will be - and the script writer [ @entity160 and @entity162 ’s @entity161 ] has already cracked it - is not to simplify it , not to just reverse the story but tell a bigger story that does n’t point the finger [ at @entity171 ] either			0
' according to the popular fairytale , @entity14 was angry that she was n't invited to the beautiful princess 's christening , and as a result cursed the infant to prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die before the end of her 16th birthday			0
is that your trailer ? a medieval - looking tent was seen on set and is no doubt belongs to @entity14 lights , camera , action ! the film crew were seen hard at work on @entity0 's first day on set other stars signed up to the film include @entity195 , who will play @entity197 @entity196 , and @entity198 , as @entity199 , one of the three fairies tasked with taking care of @entity171 in a cottage in the woods - which , going on the set , may now be a tent in a small settlement			2
she is joined by @entity208 will play fairy @entity209 and @entity211 who will star as fairy @entity213			0
anybody home ? a medieval style settlement stands empty in preparation for filming @entity0 's new movie putting up boundaries : another wall is erected at the other end of the set as a crew van arrives but it is still unclear who will play prince @entity227 , @entity171 's love and the man who defeats @entity14 , although as other characters ' names have been changed , it could well be control star @entity232 , who is billed to play @entity233			2
the @entity0 - @entity234 have made the @entity235 their temporary home and have been seen on family outings to the theatre and stores			2
huge production : cranes lower part of a set into place as the crew gets it prepared for @entity248 's arrival crew member have been busy erecting tepee style style tents , stoves over open fires , crumbly brick walls and horse - drawn carts			0

' and the solutions are not exclusively humanitarian – they are also political			0
' the international community should rededicate itself to preventing conflict , addressing it when it erupts , and solving it more quickly , ” she added , “ for that is the only way to create durable solutions for the refugees whose strength inspires us on this @entity2			2
