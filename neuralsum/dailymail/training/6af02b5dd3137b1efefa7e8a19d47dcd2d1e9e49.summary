by @entity0 published : 11:03 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 12:11 est , 6 march 2014 a doctor who left a glove inside a patient has admitted she was using a surgical technique she learned by watching a dvd			1
an investigation was carried out by the @entity8 after @entity9 found the glove inside her body three days after surgery to remove her womb			1
it emerged a member of the team involved in the operation decided to use the glove as part of the surgical procedure			2
@entity9 , 42 , had a hysterectomy at the @entity8 and three days later , when she went to the toilet , she discovered a surgical glove had been left inside her body but the female registrar had only learned about the technique on a course she attended in @entity28 weeks earlier and from watching a dvd which had discussed it , a report said			1
the use of the latex surgical glove , which was supposed to have been removed before the end of the operation , was not an ‘ accepted technique ’ at the @entity8 or one used routinely in the @entity35			1
and the report said the registrar , who has not been named , did not tell anyone else in the operating theatre what she had done , which meant the glove was not taken out			2
a horrified mrs @entity9 , 42 , later discovered the glove when she went to the toilet			1
now , the mother - of - six , from @entity45 , @entity46 , is taking legal advice after seeing the investigation report compiled by the hospital trust			2
mrs @entity9 said : ‘ reading the report was horrible because i ca n’t believe the registrar was able to do something like this and no - one knew			1
‘ it ’s so hard to understand how this could have happened			0
at first , i was just numb about the whole thing but it made me very angry			0
’ mrs @entity9 , a learning disability support worker , was admitted to the hospital last november for a hysterectomy			1
a registrar has now admitted she put the glove inside mrs @entity64 while practicing a surgical technique she had learned from a dvd the report said that during the surgery the surgeon leading the operation said his view inside her body was impaired because the air pumped inside her abdominal cavity had been lost			1
the report said the registrar decided to request clean gloves and insert one of them into her body			0
it said : ‘ as part of the investigation , the registrar informed us that she had attended a training course in november 2013 at the @entity85 , in @entity86 , @entity87 , and had used an online training dvd , both of which had discussed the use of the glove to maintain pneumoperitoneum – [ gas or air in the abdominal cavity ]			1
’ it added : ‘ [ the glove was inserted ] with no communication to any of the theatre team			0
however , the technique did work for this lady and pnuemoperitoneum was achieved			0
’ the report said telling colleagues when items had been inserted into the body was ‘ part of basic theatre practice ’ and if the registrar had told a colleague about the glove , it would have been ‘ accounted for at the end of surgery ’			2
it said : ‘ the registrar recognises that she made a mistake with good intention and , through this , she has learned the importance of good communication			0
’ the investigation also found a letter put together for @entity126 ’ gp after her surgery said she had undergone a ‘ straightforward procedure ’ with ‘ no problems at discharge ’			0
it said this letter had been dictated by a junior doctor not involved in @entity126 ’ care and a further letter with full details was sent to the gp two weeks later			0
two recommendations were made in the report - for both the consultant gynaecologist and registrar to ‘ reflect on communication , especially while in theatre ’ and for consultant - led spot checks on discharge letters			0
mrs @entity9 said : ‘ i did n’t feel well enough to go home at first but i just assumed the pain was normal and part of the process			1
i ’m glad i was still in hospital when it happened but i just keep thinking : “ what gave her the right to do this ? ” ’ the doctor , at @entity8 ( pictured ) , learned the technique in @entity28 a few weeks before mrs @entity64 's operation			1
it was n't standard procedure in this country and she did n't tell her colleagues what she was doing mrs @entity9 said she soon felt fully fit again after the glove was removed			1
the report said ‘ no adverse health outcomes ’ were expected as a result of her experience			0
@entity172 would not name the registrar or say if she still worked for the organisation			0
but a spokeswoman for the trust said : ‘ we are extremely sorry for the distress that was caused to mrs @entity9			2
‘ clearly , this should not have happened and , as soon as managers were made aware , we launched a detailed investigation			0
‘ the findings of this investigation have been shared with mrs @entity9 and her husband , who have had a meeting with the chief executive and senior medical and nursing executives			1
the hospital has apologised to @entity64 and her family and has carried out a full investigation ( file picture ) ‘ mrs @entity9 was given an opportunity to ask questions and she was given a full explanation and a further apology			1
‘ this is a confidential report which has been shared with mrs @entity9			2
we are not able to go into further detail			0
‘ at every stage , we have been frank and honest with mrs @entity9 and we have repeated our unreserved apologies for the human error which led to this distressing and unpleasant experience			2
‘ we take patient safety extremely seriously and we have put measures in place to ensure that lessons are learned from this very unfortunate , but thankfully unique , incident			0

@entity9 , 42 , had a hysterectomy at the @entity8
three days later she discovered a surgical glove had been left inside her
an investigation revealed a registrar put it there without telling anyone
she was using a technique she learned in @entity28 a few weeks earlier
idea is that the glove maintains gas or air inside the abdominal cavity
the glove had to be removed but mrs @entity9 suffered no long - term effects
the hospital has apologised and carried out a full investigation
