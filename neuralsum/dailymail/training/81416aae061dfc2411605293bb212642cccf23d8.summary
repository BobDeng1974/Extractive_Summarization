by @entity1 reporter published : 13:06 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 05:08 est , 2 august 2013 a rebel rocket struck a weapons depot in the central @entity5 city of @entity6 today setting off a series of huge explosions that killed at least 40 people and wounded dozens of others			1
the blasts sent a massive fireball into the sky , causing widespread damage and panic among residents , many of whom are supporters of president @entity19			1
one resident said the explosions were so strong they cracked the walls of some buildings			0
thick smoke and dust could be seen from a distance as explosions shook the ground			0
the explosions , which follow significant advances by @entity19 's military , show rebel forces still have the capacity to strike back			1
an official at the governor 's office in @entity6 said about 10 rockets slammed into the neighborhood of @entity51 and the nearby sports stadium , sparking a large fire and causing several casualties			2
he said the explosions caused massive destruction and wounded at least 130 people			0
he did n't offer a number for those killed			0
casualties : the series of powerful explosions reportedly killed at least 40 soldiers and civilians and wounded dozens of others panic : a giant plume of smoke trails above the city of @entity6 during the series of explosions one of which can be seen on the far right of the picture smoke billows from the ammunition depot following the blast in the @entity78 district of @entity6 the @entity79 , an @entity80 monitoring group , said that the blast killed at least 40 soldiers and civilians and left 120 wounded , some in a critical condition			1
a rebel in @entity6 said that the attack was caused by a surface - to - surface ' grad ' missile			2
he would not say which rebel group fired the missile			2
a local resident corroborated that account , saying he heard blasts for more than an hour after the first explosion			2
he said they could be heard from the overwhelmingly pro-regime districts of @entity96 and @entity97 , where the regime is known to keep arms depots			0
' @entity101 were falling on the area ... when the arms depot began to explode but we do n't know if the rockets triggered the blasts , ' he said , speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation			2
weapon : a rebel in @entity6 said that the attack was caused by a surface - to - surface ' grad ' missile normally fired from a vehicle ( file picture ) he said the explosions were so strong that ' they shook parts of the city			0
' they also shattered all windows in the area and cracked walls , he added			0
he said he spoke with @entity125 paramedics who told him that at least 22 bodies were taken to hospitals			0
the explosions in @entity6 coincided with a rare trip by president @entity19 to a former rebel bastion near the capital , @entity132 , to mark @entity133			1
@entity19 's visit to @entity135 is his first known public trip outside the capital , his seat of power , in more than a year			1
he said he was confident of victory against rebels and made a symbolic visit to a town once overrun by insurgents but now mostly retaken by his army			1
walkabout : the blast coincided with a public appearance by @entity5 president @entity19 who visited a former rebel bastion near the capital , @entity132 @entity5 president @entity19 walking with soldiers with during @entity154 day in @entity155 , @entity5 @entity19 shakes hands with a @entity5 solider during a visit to the @entity160 suburb of @entity161			1
he said he was ' confident of victory ' ' if we were not sure that we were going to win in @entity5 , we would not have the ability to resist and the ability to continue fighting for more than two years against the enemy , ' @entity19 was quoted as saying by state news agency @entity167			1
insurgents have seized large swathes of territory , but @entity19 's forces have staged a counter-offensive in recent weeks , pushing them back from around the capital @entity132 and retaking several towns near the border with @entity175			1
@entity19 has framed the revolt against four decades of his family 's rule as a foreign - backed conspiracy fought by @entity181 ' terrorists '			1
more than 100,000 people have been killed since the uprising against the @entity178 's four - decade rule began in march 2011			0
the revolt later escalated into a civil war , which has uprooted millions of people from their homes			0
@entity189 investigators say @entity19 's forces have carried out war crimes including unlawful killing , torture , sexual violence , indiscriminate attacks and pillaging in what appears to be a state - directed policy			1
they say rebels have also committed war crimes , including executions , but on a lesser scale			1
both sides accuse the other of using chemical weapons and - after months of diplomatic wrangling between the @entity189 and @entity132 over access - a chemical weapons investigation team will visit three sites where alleged attacks have occurred , the @entity189 said on wednesday			1
it is hard to say if the trip will be able to establish who was behind the attacks			0
injured : a video posted on @entity214 and @entity215 appears to show victims of a @entity5 regime assault on @entity218 foaming at the mouth suggesting the use of sarin gas one attack in the northern town of @entity224 was in march and samples of @entity226 gas - a fast - acting nerve agent that was originally developed in 1938 in @entity229 as a pesticide - can degrade very quickly , within weeks			0
rebels also seized @entity224 from @entity19 's forces last week so access to the site could be hard from the government side			1
there is still fighting in the area			0
at best , weapons inspectors will only determine scientifically whether banned chemical agents were used in the 28 - month - old conflict , and not who used them , according to the @entity240 ( @entity240 ) , which works with the @entity189 on inspections			1
members of the 15 - person team assembled by @entity244 ban ki - moon had been on standby in @entity245 since april and have only last month went to @entity246 to gather evidence			0
the @entity189 chemical weapons experts can not enter @entity5 without the government 's permission			2
the struggle in @entity5 has become markedly sectarian , broadly pitting majority @entity253 rebels against @entity19 's minority @entity256 sect , which is an offshoot of @entity259			2
@entity19 has relied on @entity256 - led army units and security forces from the start , but has turned increasingly to loyalist militia armed and funded by @entity132 to fight the rebels			2
he has also received solid support from @entity259 regional powerhouse @entity265 , @entity175 's @entity269 movement and longtime ally @entity267 , while his fragmented foes have received little military aid from their @entity274 backers , wary of the growing presence of hardline @entity181 groups , some of which are linked to @entity278			0
nine @entity280 nations urged the @entity281 on thursday to back plans for an @entity280 - wide passenger data list aimed at thwarting suspected militants travelling from @entity285 to fight in @entity5 , fearing they will return to home to carry out attacks in @entity285 .			0
