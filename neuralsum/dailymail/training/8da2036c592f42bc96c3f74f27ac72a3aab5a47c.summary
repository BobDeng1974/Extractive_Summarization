by @entity0 @entity1 : 17:20 est , 23 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:03 est , 24 december 2013 what is essentially a glorified sock has helped boost the net income of the world ’s largest athletic clothing company by nearly 40per cent			0
@entity12 ’s @entity11 sneaker , which uses knitted fibers to create a lightweight , durable , and incredibly attractive shoe , is one of the main contributors to the brand ’s steady sales increases and progress on the stock market , @entity9 says			1
at $ 160 , the eco-conscious shoe is among one of @entity12 ’s most expensive product offerings in the women ’s footwear category			1
additional styles like the woven @entity42 ( $ 200 ) sneaker have helped raise the brand ’s aesthetic profile even further			0
but those designs have not registered the same kind of fanfare as the coveted @entity48 - which is now offered in a large variety of colorways			0
@entity12 has even adapted @entity11 technology for its sturdier @entity54 running shoe , and has used @entity11 threads in a winterized sneaker that will be worn by medal - winning @entity58 olympians on the podium in @entity61			1
in the athletics division , @entity12 ’s $ 225 @entity63 soccer cleats have proven an equal success to the @entity11 's street appeal , @entity9 says			1
decreased raw material costs have helped widen the brand ’s profit margins on the already higher - priced merchandise			0
@entity71 : the brand adapted its @entity11 threads for a winterized sneaker that @entity58 medal - winning olympians will wear on the podium in @entity61 @entity77 , an analyst for @entity78 , told @entity9 that ‘ the growing global health and wellness trend plus strong product innovations are driving @entity12 ’s business			1
’ the shoe 's one - piece upper portion is constructed of polyester fibers that are woven more tightly in areas of the foot that require additional support			0
research for the @entity11 sneaker began in 2002 when @entity12 product developers realized that athletes at @entity94 were training barefoot			1
@entity12 says that the result is a lightweight , ' second - skin ' experience that creates little - to - none environmental waste in its production thanks to its specially - designed knitting machines			1
@entity102 analyst @entity101 , chimed in on @entity12 for @entity103 saying that ‘ @entity12 ’s cool factor is highest among adults 18 - 24 , and significantly higher among non-whites than whites , both boding extremely well for @entity12 long - term			2
’ [ sic ] the brand reported last week that its quarterly sales had increased by 8per cent to $ 6.43 billion			0
@entity12 stocks recently hit an all - time high of $ 80 per share – though some analysts appear skeptical of the brand ’s capability for further market growth			2
@entity12 representatives have attributed the label ’s rising success to not only more expensive goods , but its growing foothold in e-commerce as well			1
@entity12 ’s online sales have risen 33per cent in the last year , they say , and represent at least 15per cent of the company ’s overall revenue			2
for this reason , @entity12 has rejigged its line of @entity128 - reliant ‘ @entity127 , ’ with a more modern appearance			2
the brand plans to launch additional e-commerce sites this year in @entity132 and @entity133 – the latter of which is the third largest online shopping economy in the world			0
athletic success : @entity12 's $ 225 @entity63 soccer cleats ( above ) are proving an equal success to the @entity11 technology @entity12 is anticipating a banner year in 2014 with its sponsorship of three major flagship events : the @entity144 , @entity145 , and the @entity146 among them			1
the brand has created specialty product lines and athletic apparel for each event , and says that its wholesale orders reflect an excitement surrounding this year 's spread of games			0
analysts say that @entity12 ’s overhead costs to promote the events , though , will likely overshadow sales increases created by the limited - edition goods			0
as ms @entity101 said : ‘ despite its terrific top line track record in recent years , @entity12 still has many opportunities to grow its top line			0

the @entity11 sneaker is one of @entity12 's most expensive product offerings
