by @entity0 insurers and banks are sending customers reems of terms and conditions , with more words than @entity8 , which is 19,000 words long insurers and banks have come under attack for sending customers reams of unnecessary policy documents that are even longer than @entity8			1
nearly three quarters of consumers admitted to not reading all of their policy documents or @entity17 because they were too long			1
while only 17 per cent of people who did read it in full said they understood it , according to the survey of more than 2,000 people			0
consumer group @entity23 , who commissioned the survey , has launched a campaign against the book - length policy documents that are riddled with legalese and jargon			1
several terms and conditions sent out to customers were found to be nearly twice the length of @entity8 - which is 19,000 words long			1
analysis by @entity23 found @entity35 topped the table for the longest bank account t&cs at just over 34,000 words long - almost 5,000 words longer than @entity40 ’s @entity41			1
the shortest in the sector was @entity44 ’s , though it still weighed in at a hefty 11,000 words			0
in car insurance , @entity46 has the dubious honour of longest motor policy with more than 37,000 words - just a few hundred words shy of @entity52 ’s @entity51			0
while @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 all had policy documents of over 30,000 words - longer than @entity59 ’s @entity58			0
the shortest in the sector was @entity61 with just under 7,000 words			0
@entity63 , founder and managing director of @entity23 , said all banks and insurers should make documents more accessible and do away with small print that is riddled with legalese and jargon			0
he said : ‘ if next to no one is reading terms and conditions , and even those who do are struggling to understand them , then what exactly is the point of these documents ? ‘ of course it ’s important that customers know what ’s covered and what is n’t in their insurance policy , but if one company can do the job in less than 7,000 words , there ’s no excuse for insurers who are producing documents that are five times as long			2
@entity35 's terms and conditions were among the longest , the survey found , totalling 34,000 words			2

consumer group has launched campaign against length of @entity17
