by @entity0 published : 09:33 est , 19 march 2012 updated : 07:18 est , 20 march 2012 @entity1 is successfully transforming into a full - blown web tv service - site users are staying 60 per cent longer than they did a year ago			1
the average time spent watching video on @entity7 video sites is now 418.2 minutes per user , per month , according to @entity10 data			1
the shift is credited to @entity1 's recent relaunch , which added a focus on tv - like ' channels ' and longer , professionally made shows			1
@entity7 staff said that subscriptions to the site 's ' channels ' have gone up 50 per cent since the ' new look ' launched in december			1
new look : the new look gathers ' channels ' in the black navigation bar on the right hand side of the page making it more like @entity7 's homepage ' the data is a sign that @entity1 ’s sizeable audience base is beginning to tune in for longer periods of time , rather than simply snacking and leaving , ' said @entity32			0
' that result is at least in part a function of @entity1 ’s decision to offer more compelling , longer - form content			2
' three billion videos are viewed on @entity1 every day			0
@entity7 is attempting to ' shift ' the way people use the site , with the increased focus on ' channels ' a clear attempt to mirror services offered by tv stations			1
the new look has made it easier to find ' channels ' from the front page , with a black navigation menu on the left hand side which allows users to organise channels , rather than simply search for video using @entity7 search			2
' more and more , behind every great video is a great channel , ' said @entity1 via its official blog			0
professional approach : advertisers prefer not to be next to user - generated content so earlier this year , @entity1 announced a range of professionally produced channels from celebrities such as @entity67 ' @entity69 ' channels allow users to earn a percentage by signing up for @entity7 's ' partner ' programme , where they earn some of the advertising revenue generated by the site			1
but @entity1 will also offer professional content			0
the site launched 100 new professionally produced channels in partnership with stars such as singer @entity67 and actor @entity81			2
owner @entity7 says that the channels will be on - demand services , each offering 25 hours of programming a day			0
many big - ticket advertisers are relucant to be seen alongside ' user - generated ' videos , and would be happier with professionally produced , star - studded content			0
the money is an advance on advertising money - @entity7 is expected to recoup its outlay .			0

site users now stay for 418 minutes per month
increase of 60 **%** on last year , say @entity10 figures
comes in wake of relaunch to become more tv - like
subscriptions to @entity106 have risen 50 **%**
