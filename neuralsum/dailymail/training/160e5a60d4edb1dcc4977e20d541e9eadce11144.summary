by @entity0 @entity1 has launched a new store blueprint for its originals fashion brand with a @entity4 equipped lounge and mobile charging points , aiming to persuade younger shoppers to linger longer and spend more in its high - margin , own - run outlets			1
the world 's @entity11 sportswear maker behind @entity13 wants to lift sales from its own shops , which accounted for 24per cent of its 2013 revenue of approximately $ 20billion , because they are more profitable than those made through third parties			0
the revamped originals store in the heart of @entity22 is part of a drive to encourage 16 - 24 year - olds to browse longer			1
plugged in : the new @entity1 store in @entity22 ( pictured ) is meant to attend to millennials ' needs with @entity29 store-esque charging ports and wi - fi ‘ shopping for this generation is very social			1
they need to have a place to hang out			0
the longer the consumer stays in the store , the more likely they are to buy , ’ @entity31 , @entity1 global head of retail environments , told @entity0			1
the shift from wholesale to retail helped boost the @entity45 firm 's gross margin by 1.5 percentage points to 49.3per cent in 2013 compared with 43.6per cent for @entity13 , which makes less than a fifth of sales from its own stores and online			1
@entity1 plans to open a net 250 stores in 2014 , primarily in eastern @entity54 , even though its already high exposure to @entity56 - where it operates over 1,000 stores - has hurt its share price in recent weeks due to the @entity60 crisis			2
it added a net 294 stores in 2013 to bring the total to 2,740 , including about 250 stores under the @entity20 brand , but not counting some 7,500 @entity1 franchises operated in @entity66			2
in addition to a @entity4 lounge near the fitting rooms and a ‘ digital bar ’ for charging devices , the revamped store seeks to reflect the @entity22 urban vibe by stripping back decor to raw concrete and brick and exposing lighting , while underwear is displayed in an eye - catching vending machine			0
prominently featured : @entity1 highlights its line of sneakers in the store - a key selling point among young people the new @entity22 format gives more prominence to footwear , including high - heel sneakers designed by @entity91 creative director @entity90 and multicolor variants of the recently - relaunched classic white - and - green @entity94 tennis shoes			1
previously a male - oriented brand , the store seeks to more clearly showcase women 's wear as well as collaborations with partners such as fashion chain @entity100 and colorful @entity103 brand @entity102 , timed for the soccer @entity104 starting in june			0
@entity1 plans to roll out the concept to originals stores in over 30 cities , with @entity109 and @entity110 next for the makeover			2
it also has big ambitions for its new teen fashion brand @entity113 , which is being extended to @entity115 and the @entity116			0
however , sports - inspired fashion is becoming increasingly competitive with big players such as @entity121 's @entity120 , @entity123 's @entity122 and @entity124 all offering more sportswear in recent years			0
casual clothes : another big seller , hoodies and track jackets , are also on full display in the store and @entity1 , which has been losing market share in @entity54 to @entity13 , must make sure the push into fashion does not distract from a core focus on sports performance , a mistake that cost @entity45 rival @entity140 dear			1
to that end , it is also revamping its flagship sportswear stores , seeking to create a stadium - like experience and , like the new originals store , putting a focus on footwear and creating a multi-media experience for shoppers			1
' footwear is treated as the centre of the brand and the heart of the experience , ' @entity31 said			0
' the consumer can buy everything , anywhere online			2
we need to give them a compelling reason to come into the store			0

the sportswear giant is hoping that the longer *customers* stay in the store , the more likely they are to buy
the new @entity1 retail model echoes that of @entity29 , where shoppers can browse online on its latest *products*
