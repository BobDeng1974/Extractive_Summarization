by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 12:06 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 12:41 est , 23 january 2014 an embarrassed @entity3 was today forced to disown the whole of his party ’s 2010 manifesto , after being hit with a host of bizarre proposals he knew nothing about			1
the @entity11 @entity10 promised to improve @entity11 by painting trains in traditional colours , deploying soldiers on the street and enforcing a dress code for taxi drivers and theatregoers			1
despite standing on the manifesto as a candidate in the 2010 election , mr @entity3 insisted it was nothing to do with him and ' none of it stands today '			2
he had briefly stood aside as leader at the time to concentrate on trying to get elected to the @entity41			1
the @entity10 leader was also given a verbal battering by high - flying financial analyst @entity44 who shouted ‘ shame on you ’ for saying women in the @entity46 should be paid less			1
mr @entity3 , a usually - confident tv performer , appeared to struggle when asked if @entity10 now has any official policies at all			1
some of the more eye - catching policies in @entity10 's 2010 manifesto include : it included plans for a flat tax regardless of income , and their much - criticised economic plans which include cutting taxes by £ 90billion but increasing spending by £ 30billion			1
mr @entity3 claimed the latter was not ‘ nonsense ’ although conceded it was ‘ ambitious ’			2
his party are also apparently reviewing their plans to restrict the number of foreigners on @entity11 football teams , which it believes is behind their ‘ lack of success ’ ; banning the burqa , axing the @entity71 , imposing ‘ proper dress ’ in theatres , hotels and restaurants , and investigating alleged discrimination against white people at the @entity78			1
he told @entity80 ’s @entity79 that he did not defend the 2010 manifesto saying he did not put it together			2
he has been party leader since 2006 but stepped for a while in september 2009 to run - unsuccessfully - for a seat in @entity84 at the 2010 election			1
however he said all policies were under review pending the party ’s new manifesto for 2015 , to be published after the @entity91 elections in may			1
he claimed it would be ‘ similar in flavour ’ , but the only policies he would commit to yesterday were bringing back grammar schools and leaving the @entity96			1
mr @entity3 floundered as he was asked about the party ’s proposal to scrap @entity99 , saying he was not sure the suggestion had come from			2
when told it was on the @entity10 website , he said : ‘ when it comes to websites , i ’m not the expert			1
’ he also claimed not to know about a compulsory dress code for taxi drivers and proposal to repaint trains			2
‘ look , under the last leadership and in the 2010 election we managed to present a manifesto that was 486 pages long ’ , he said			2
‘ so you can quote me all sorts of bits of it that i will not know			0
that ’s why i ’ve said none of it stands today and we will launch it all after the @entity91 elections			0
’ the faltering performance came after the @entity10 leader , who worked in a brokerage firm before entering politics , caused outrage this week by saying women who have children are less valuable to their employers when they return to work			1
he claimed the @entity46 was no longer sexist as in the past , but said women who leave their client base to take ‘ two or three years off ’ to have a baby , put themselves at a disadvantage			0
mr @entity3 was appearing on @entity80 's @entity79 determined to talk about topics other than @entity91 and immigration today he was confronted by miss @entity44 , a markets analyst at @entity46 brokers @entity140 partners and former equities broker at @entity143 , who said that mr @entity3 ’s argument was ‘ laughable ’ and he was ‘ talking out of his bottom ’			0
she said : ‘ for all the working mothers out there who are battling day - to - day in the @entity46 , and elsewhere , who are discriminated against , who are paid less than their male colleagues , who are looked over for promotion , i say on behalf of them ‘ shame on you ’			0
‘ and i say double shame on you because you have daughters			0
what kind of example are you setting to your daughters by saying what you said ? what you are saying us laughable			0
you are talking out of your bottom			0
’ miss @entity44 became known as the face of the financial crisis for her tv analysis of the @entity91 economic downturn in 2011			0
she accused mr @entity3 of factual inaccuracy as women can only take a maximum of 12 months maternity leave , not three years			0
she took four months off when she had her child			0
financial analyst @entity44 took mr @entity3 to task for saying women who take time off to have children are ' worth less ' to big @entity46 firms the @entity10 leader claimed when he worked in finanace he never took more than a week ’s holiday because he could not leave his clients			1
he said employees in that field had to be ‘ more hardnosed ’ than in other careers and few women were able to cope with ‘ a family and a big job ’ of that sort			0
but miss @entity44 hit back saying that many @entity46 firms poach employees from their rivals and are prepared to wait up to 18 months for them to start after they finish ‘ gardening leave ’			0
this is standard in @entity46 jobs so employees do not use inside knowledge they have gained to their advantage .			0

@entity10 leader under pressure over whether the party has any policies
as well as leaving the @entity96 , the party also promised £ 90billion in tax cuts
' theatregoers should dress *smartly* and axe the @entity71 '
