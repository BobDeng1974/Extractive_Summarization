@entity0 has teased a range of new products that it will unveil at next week ’s @entity3			1
this includes two speakers that offer high quality audio - no matter what direction it is facing			2
the speakers use ‘ breakthrough ’ @entity12 technology , which the @entity14 firm claims allows ‘ sound to flow in a 360 - degree radius ’			1
they use ‘ breakthrough ’ @entity12 technology , which the @entity14 firm claims allows ‘ sound to flow in a 360 - degree radius ’ @entity0 also said this technology creates the perfect balance between treble and bass - but did not reveal more about how its proprietary version of the technology works			1
the two speakers are called @entity19 and @entity21 , and both claim to fill entire rooms with sound			2
the former is a stand - type speaker , which means it is typically fixed to one location , while the latter is a portable version with a built - in battery			1
both are @entity44 enabled , and can be connected to tvs , mobiles , tablets and soundbars			1
speakers typically produce sound using an electromagnet that moves a cone to create sound waves			2
drivers are then used to translate electrical signals into physical vibrations that produce the sound			0
these include a tweeter , which creates a high frequency , a midrange , and a woofer which creates low frequencies			0
a dome tweeter is made using a voice coil attached to the dome , with a front plate connected to the magnet			0
as a result , they usually direct sound in limited directions			0
in a ring radiator , however , the cone or dome is suspended , which means there are less restrictions on which direction the sound can travel and flow			2
‘ we know how much people love music and that ’s why we are expanding our portfolio to bring high - quality , wireless audio into the home , ’ said @entity80 , senior vice president at @entity0			1
‘ with the new wam7500 / 6500 people can enjoy a vibrant sound wherever they are			2

@entity0 ’s @entity21 range is n’t the first to offer this type of sound coverage , and they will rival @entity126 speaker , for example			1
these are powered by two 1.5 - inch ( 3.8cm ) drivers on each side of the speaker , and are paired with 2 - inch ( 5cm ) radiators , designed to improve the bass			0
