schools in some parts of the country are having to raid their own budgets to pay for @entity5 ’s plan to give four to seven - year - old pupils free meals			1
freedom of information figures suggest nearly a third of councils can not afford to provide free school lunches for infants from september			0
in some areas , schools themselves could have to pay towards the expensive kitchen and dining room upgrades needed to deliver the policy			0
schools are having to raid their own budgets to pay for kitchen and dining room upgrades to provide free school meals for children after @entity5 made a pledge at last year 's @entity25 in @entity28 , primaries with more than 150 pupils are being asked to contribute a total of £ 250,000 – 25 per cent of the cost of improving kitchens			1
and @entity33 council in @entity34 said schools will be funding £ 150,000 worth of upgrades			1
overall , across 29 councils , there is a funding shortfall of at least £ 23million			1
the figures will add to controversy surrounding the policy , which was announced by the deputy prime minister at last year ’s @entity45 conference			0
@entity47 sources said the £ 600million plan was drawn up ‘ on the back of a fag packet ’ as part of a coalition deal , which saw the @entity45 agree not to oppose similarly expensive tax breaks for married couples			1
but many primary school heads warned at the time that they did not have the space or kitchen facilities to provide for an extra 1.5million children			0
sources claim that mr @entity5 failed to take into account the cost of improving school kitchens to meet the demand , forcing the government to offer more money for upgrades			1
the @entity66 is refusing to release warning emails , understood to have been sent by the @entity68 to officials and ministers , pointing out potential problems with the funding of the scheme			0
mr @entity5 has insisted that the plan is fully funded , but freedom of information requests have revealed a gap of £ 23million as @entity47 's accuse @entity5 of drawing the idea up ' on the back of a fag packet ' mr @entity5 insisted last month that the plan was ‘ fully funded ’			1
but @entity81 ’s shadow schools minister @entity80 said it was increasingly clear the policy was ‘ a complete shambles ’ , adding : ‘ @entity85 urgently needs to explain to parents why some schools will be forced to fund this commitment out of their own budgets , how this will affect standards at those schools and which children will be missing out in september			2
’ responses to @entity96 requests by mr @entity80 reveal that almost a third of councils have not been given enough money by the government to fund the programme from september			1
of the 43 councils that said it was not enough , 29 provided details of their estimated shortfalls – a total of £ 23,036,824			0
@entity108 has a shortfall of around £ 4.3million , while @entity110 and @entity111 councils both have shortfalls of at least £ 3million			2
initially , mr @entity5 promised that all free lunches would be a hot meal			2
but this was downgraded to an aspiration rather than a commitment once problems with kitchens were raised			0
last week , it emerged that more than 3,000 schools will buy in pre-prepared meals and either keep them warm or reheat them in mini-kitchens			2
dozens of others will offer only cold lunches , in some cases at pupils ’ desks .			0

@entity5 insists that £ 600million school meals pledge is fully funded
but @entity96 requests reveal £ *23milllion* funding gap
