the surgeon ’s troubles began in 2009 when he was diagnosed with a cavernous hemangioma , a type of blood - filled sac , on his spine			1

he lived with the cyst for 11 months until september 2010 , when the sac ruptured and the necessary surgery he underwent thereafter left him numb from the waist down			2
suddenly @entity6 , who practices in @entity66 , @entity1 , found himself going from performing 1,000 surgeries per year to not knowing if he ’d ever work again			1
‘ one of my first thoughts was , “ oh my gosh , my life as i know it was erased , ” ’ he recalls			0
‘ who you are out of the @entity3 is gone and you have to redefine yourself			0
’ but the dedicated physician soon came to his senses and decided he ’d be back in the or no matter what it took			0

the first surgery he undertook was watched over by another surgeon in case @entity83 needed help			0

@entity6 began performing all the procedures he could from a sitting wheelchair : on hands , elbows , feet , ankles , and knees			1

undeterred , he beat that problem , too			0
loving family : here , @entity6 hugs his wife , @entity100 , before going into the operating room			2
@entity6 credits his wife for and family for helping him overcome his disability on the job : dr. @entity6 is able to repair knees , elbows and other joints while sitting in his wheelchair			1
he uses a special standup wheelchair to repair shoulders , which requires the patient to be sitting up ' it ¿ s just been a very powerful experience ' : @entity6 briefly feared for his future -- professional and personal -- after he fell ill. but he quickly came to his senses and started on the long road to recovery and continued success as a surgeon now when the doctor performs shoulder surgery he does so strapped into a wheelchair that keeps him in an upright position			1
so where does the doctor get his incredible strength ? it ’s not just from his rigorous workouts			0
