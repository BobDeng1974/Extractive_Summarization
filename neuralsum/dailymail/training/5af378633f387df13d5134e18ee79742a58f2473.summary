@entity0 wonders if there will be a day where she could go about her life without being asked if @entity4 is her real son			1
she had her husband @entity5 , who are both of @entity7 descent , welcomed their first child two years ago but were shocked to find that he had a rare medical condition - one that is believed to have only struck two families in @entity12			1
the main symptoms being that @entity4 had intractable diarrhoea , an immune deficiency and blonde hair			1
but the @entity17 - who live in @entity18 in @entity20 's north shore - say they are approached by strangers at least three times a day , intrigued to learn about @entity4 ' biological history			1
on many occasions , mrs @entity0 says has been left frustrated and angered by questions which imply her son does not belong to her			1
@entity0 with her two - year - old son @entity4 who has tricho hepato enteric syndrome which includes symptoms such as blonde hair it took doctors one and a half years after @entity4 was born that doctors were able to diagnose him with the rare medical condition ' it took us a year and a half to find out what medical condition @entity4 had and the doctors had never heard of such a case , ' mrs @entity0 told @entity41			1
@entity4 has tricho hepato enteric syndrome - a disorder which has only ever been reported 44 times worldwide			1
needless to say , it was an arduous time for the first - time parents as @entity48 and mrs @entity0 were desperate for some kind of diagnosis for their son who was born prematurely at 32 weeks			1
' we had to go through test after test which kept coming back negative so we were pretty much living in the hospital for a year and a half , ' mrs @entity0 said			1
' it was painful but in the end we were so happy to finally get an answer			0
' however the @entity17 were faced with the reality that there was limited information and research surrounding the uncommon illness			0
there are reportedly only two families in @entity12 , seven around the world , who have tricho hepato enteric syndrome			1
' we actually went and visited the one other family in @entity12 who have a child with the same condition as @entity4 , ' she said			2
' we 're lucky in a way to know that there 's another family in @entity12 who 's going through the same thing as us			2
' from what we know , and with the minimal information that we have , we 're the first @entity7 family in @entity12 to have the syndrome so far			2
' @entity4 was born prematurely at 32 weeks and had to be kept in hospital for a year and a half due to @entity4 ' rare disorder , he was unable to digest anything as he had intractable diarrhoea mrs @entity0 says her son 's symptoms are now manageable and he 's becoming more healthy each day while mrs @entity0 , 32 , tends to her child 's medical needs as he has trouble digesting food , she also has to deal with the multiple questions and assumptions made about why her son naturally has platinum blonde hair			1
' nobody knows about his condition because there 's not much research about it , ' she said			0
' @entity4 ' symptoms are now manageable but he used to get diarrhoea about 30 to 45 times a day			2
' so her annoyance is understandable when she is constantly questioned by strangers , who most which are quite presumptuous and rude			0
' it depends how i 'm approached but unfortunately most of the time i get asked " was he born like that ? " or " why is he blonde " and they 're all asked in a judgemental tone so that 's why i react in a negative way , ' she said			2
' it 's as if they 're asking me whether he 's been adopted			0
actually , i was even asked by this one woman : " is he your real son ? "			2
' ' i feel that when i 'm asked in a rude way that the information is really none of their business and i 'm seriously so sick of the questions			0
' ( from left ) husband @entity134 , little @entity4 and mum @entity0 mr @entity134 , 34 , spending some quality time with his first child @entity4 while mrs @entity0 recognises the natural curiosity of others , she wants people to think before they jump to conclusions			1
' i 'm not exaggerating when i say that i get asked minimum three times a day , ' she said			2
' but i get it , @entity4 stands out			0
he has blonde hair and i 've even given him a trendy haircut because i love his hair and want to make the most of it			2
' i know where people are coming from but they should think before they ask such rude questions and if they were more polite about it then i 'm happy to respond			0
' yet in a more recent incident , mrs @entity0 was at a restaurant with her family when another diner interrupted her meal and questioned her about @entity4			1
' she stopped eating and came straight up to our table and asked me : " why is he blonde ? "			0
she did n't even say hello or anything , ' she said			0
' if she had approached me in a more polite way i would n't have been so angry about it			0
' ever since @entity4 came into her life , mrs @entity0 's outlook on life has changed			1
' i know that if i saw someone looking a little different on the street that i would n't go up and ask them about it - it 's their life and it 's personal , ' she said			0
' my dream goal is to help mums with sick kids or children with special needs because i 've been through it all			0
' some people think we should appreciate it that we 're being given special attention when all we really want is to be treated like any other person			0
' i feel uncomfortable with that kind of attention and it can be quite frustrating at times			0

it took over a year for @entity0 and @entity134 , of @entity20 , to find out about their son 's rare condition
@entity4 , 2 , has tricho hepato enteric syndrome with one of the main symptoms being blonde hair
but with @entity4 ' parents being of @entity7 descent , mrs @entity0 is asked at least three times a day why her son has blonde hair
it is believed there are only two families in @entity12 who have the disorder
the syndrome has only been recorded 44 times worldwide
mrs @entity0 says she is frustrated when rude strangers sk her if @entity4 is her real son
