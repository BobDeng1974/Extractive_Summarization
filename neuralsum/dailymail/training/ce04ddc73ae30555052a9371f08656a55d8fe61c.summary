the @entity0 is developing tiny unmanned drones that will fly in swarms , hover like bees , crawl like spiders and even sneak up on unsuspecting targets and execute them with lethal precision			1
the @entity8 , a research arm of the @entity0 , has released a computer - animated video outlining the the future capabilities of @entity12 ( @entity13 )			1
the project promises to revolutionize war by down - sizing the combatants			0
' @entity13 will become a vital element in the ever - changing war - fighting environment and will help ensure success on the battlefield of the future , ' the narrator intones			2
' @entity24 , pervasive , lethal - @entity12 , enhancing the capabilities of the future war fighter			1
the @entity0 has already developed a drone capable of hovering like a moth perching : the video , released by the @entity34 , shows a pigeon - like drone that can draw power from an electrical wire while its camera watches a target crawling : the drones will be equipped with legs so that they can crawl through tight spaces like an insect the project , which is based at @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47 , was revealed in the march issue of the @entity49			1
@entity0 officials said they have already produced tiny remote - control prototypes - but they consume so much power that can only operate for a few minutes			1
researchers estimate that it will take several years of advances in battery technology to make the designs feasible			0
still , the @entity0 has a clear concept of what it hopes to accomplish with the program			0
the promotional video begins with a swarm of tiny drones be dropped on a city from a passing plane			1
the drones will work in concert to patch together a wide , detailed view of the battlefield - singling out individual targets without losing sight of the broader scene			1
' data will be communicated among the @entity13 to enable real time , reliable decision - making and to provide an advanced overall picture for other platforms or operators , ' the @entity0 says			2
killing : the video demonstrates how @entity13 could be used to sneak up behind unsuspecting targets and kill them with a single , lethal shot lethal : the drones could be equipped with incapacitating chemicals , combustible payloads or even explosives ' for precision targeting capability ' as the drones fall , they begin to fly - not like planes , but like insects			1
high frequency flapping wings allow the drones to hover and maneuver in tight spaces			2
the military has already produced a drone patterned after a hawk moth that can flap its wings 30 times a second			0
however , the activity exhausts the drone 's tiny battery in just a few minutes , according to @entity49			2
another drone type soars like a pigeon and perches unobtrusively on a power line to observe a surveillance target with a camera			2
the @entity0 is working on technology that will allow the drones to steal electricity from power cables and other sources - so they can continue to operate for days or weeks on end			0
swarming : the drones couple be dropped en masse over a battlefield or a city and would work together to create a complex surveillance network working together : the drones would use advanced software to navigate by ' sight , ' rather than @entity124 - which can be blocked by buildings or by jamming from the enemy the @entity0 training video shows a winged @entity13 following a target as he drives through the streets of a dense city			1
advanced sensors will enable ' optic flow , ' which will allow remote pilots to fly by ' sight ' - rather than flying by @entity124 , which can be disrupted by buildings or deliberately jammed by enemy forces			0
the video depicts three drones following the target into a house , where they maneuver hallways and rooms undetected			0
' small size and agile flight will allow @entity13 to covertly enter locations inaccessible by traditional means of aerial surveillance , ' the narrator says			0
the video follows the drones as they fly through an open door and sneak up behind a man who is aiming a sniper rifle			0
' @entity13 may perform direct attack missions and can be equipped with incapacitating chemicals , combustible payloads or even explosives for precision targeting capability , ' according to the video			1
on screen , a small , hovering vehicle pauses before shooting the man directly in the back of the head .			0

@entity169 at @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47 , is already developing prototypes of tiny drones that can hover
the @entity12 will work in swarms to provide complex surveillance of a battlefield
they can also be armed with incapacitating chemicals , combustible payloads or even explosives ' for precision targeting capability '
