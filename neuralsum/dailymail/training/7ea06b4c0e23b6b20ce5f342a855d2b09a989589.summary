former @entity1 mayor @entity0 joined @entity3 and disabled protestors camped outside the @entity4 at the premiere of ' the death of @entity7 ' last week which tells the story of four @entity11 hijackers who brought terror to the @entity14 cruise ship in the @entity15 in 1985			1
the slick production has been criticized for glamorising terrorism in its portrayal of the infamous atrocity in which the terrorists murdered an elderly disabled @entity22 @entity3 passenger , @entity7 in full view of many of the @entity22 and @entity26 passengers on board			2
they then threw his blood - stained body - still in his wheelchair - overboard			0
they then threw his body - still in his wheelchair - overboard the hijackers threatened to execute more passengers if their demands to release 50 @entity11 terrorists held in @entity54 jails were not met			1
but what the opera fails to explain is one of the true motives behind the @entity14 attack - and why one prisoner in particular was of key significance			1
@entity62 , the murderous leader of the @entity63 - the terror group behind the hijacking - was determined to make @entity54 release @entity65			1
his was the only name specified by the hijackers			0
@entity65 , a @entity69 citizen and a friend of @entity62 , had been jailed five years earlier by the @entity54 for one of the most horrendous and notorious acts in @entity54 's history			1
@entity65 and an accomplice launched an attempted kidnapping of a @entity3 family in @entity54 which resulted in the horrific deaths of a young father and two young daughters			1
wife and mother , @entity82 , was the only survivor after the raid on the fateful night of april 22 , 1979 , in @entity84 , in northern @entity54 , close to the @entity69 border			1
@entity82 wrote in 2003 : ' it was a murder of unimaginable cruelty , crueler even than the murder of @entity7 , the @entity22 tourist who was shot on the @entity14 and dumped overboard in his wheelchair			1
' when the family heard the men approaching their apartment , @entity82 grabbed her two - year - old daughter , @entity93 , and managed to hide with her in a ceiling loft space			1
her 31 - year - old husband , @entity96 , and her elder daughter @entity97 , four , tried to run to an underground shelter but were caught by the intruders			2
the terrorists , who had already killed a policeman en route from the beach where they had landed in an inflatable dinghy , began searching for mother and daughter			2
horror : @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity107 were killed in a botched kidnapping in @entity84 , @entity54 , at the hands of terrorists in 1979			1
the killings are still seen as one of the worst episodes in the country 's history dirty deal : @entity62 , the murderous leader of the @entity63 - the terror group behind the @entity118 - was determined to make @entity54 release @entity65 - who killed the family survivor : @entity82 , @entity96 's wife and mother to the two girls , told @entity123 that she was upset that the death of @entity7 does not reference in any way the horror her family endured in a bid to avoid being caught , @entity82 hushed @entity93 's cries by putting her hand over her terrified little girl 's mouth and the attackers failed to locate them overhead			1
@entity96 and @entity97 were taken away by @entity65 to the beach			2
but the alarm had been raised and the police were in hot pursuit			0
@entity65 abandoned any hope of returning with hostages			0
according to eyewitnesses , @entity96 was shot in front of @entity97 - so the last thing she would see was her father being murdered			0
then @entity65 killer her by smashing her skull against a rock with a rifle butt			1
the postscript to the awful events of that night was no less shocking			0
in @entity82 's own words : ' by the time we were rescued from the crawl space , hours later , @entity93 , too , was dead			1
in trying to save all our lives , i had smothered her			0
' the next day @entity62 , who planned the attack with @entity65 - who was caught that night - said it had been done ' to protest the signing of the @entity54 - @entity164 peace treaty at @entity165 ' seven months earlier			1
writing in the @entity166 in 2003 , @entity82 said : ' @entity65 's mission against my family , which never made world headlines , was also masterminded by @entity62			1
' and my wish now is that this terrorist leader should be prosecuted in the @entity22 , so that the world may know of all his terrorist acts , not the least of which is what he did to my family			0
' her pleas went unheeded			0
despite his violent terrorist past and the efforts of many intelligence agencies to apprehend him , @entity62 was never brought to account for his many acts of terrorism			0
as part of the 1993 @entity186 treaty between @entity54 and the @entity11 , he was controversially allowed to move freely around the @entity187 as a representative of the @entity189			2
he spent some years in @entity190 before moving to @entity191 where he reportedly became the conduit through which @entity191 dictator @entity193 – a sworn enemy of @entity54 – paid $ 25,000 bounties to the family of each @entity11 suicide bomber who killed @entity54			2
brutal : @entity65 , seen here being arrested after the murders , shot @entity96 dead on a beach and then killed @entity97 by smashing her head against a rock with a rifle butt			1
meanwhile , @entity82 had tragically smothered @entity93 to death as she held her hand over her mouth to stifle the girl 's screams as they hid in a crawl space in their home senseless : @entity65 and his accomplice had landed on the @entity54 beach with the aim of kidnapping the family in an operation masterminded by @entity62 , the leader of the @entity63 haunted : evidence from the pathologist 's report showing that @entity97 's brain tissue was found on the rifle butt @entity62 was captured by @entity22 forces in @entity191 in 2003 and reportedly died a year later , while still in custody , of natural causes			1
despite an outcry in @entity54 against the decision , @entity65 was released from prison five years later in 2008 , returning to a hero 's welcome in @entity69 - where he was met at the airport by both the @entity69 president and prime minister - while , not to be outdone , @entity227 president @entity226 granted him the @entity236			1
he remains a free man			0
the awful events of that 1979 night still shock more than 35 years later , but are apparently not presented nor referenced in any way in ' @entity240 ' , to the dismay of @entity82			2
the key , sickening event that specifically inspired the hijacking - and might have put it into proper even more grotesque context – is absent from the production			2
this week , @entity82 , now in her 60s , still living in @entity84 , and who some years ago re-married and has two adult daughters from her second marriage , spoke to @entity123			2
@entity82 , who is now a clinical social worker who cares for @entity3 and @entity252 children in her mixed community in the @entity254 , has not seen ' @entity240 '			0
but she expresses concern at the glaring omission of the truly horrific catalyst to the story – her story - which they fail to mention at any point			0
' these days i see that everybody is trying to simplify everything without making people have to think too much , ' @entity82 said			0
' they take anything that is controversial , or that will grab attention , and portray everything as black and white ... like in the news coverage connected to the very complicated issue between us [ @entity54 ] and the people around us , including the @entity11			2
' ' the opera appears to be yet another easy way to show things in a superficial way ; simplified , very basic , without looking at the background in enough depth			0
it surprises me that they ’re doing an opera about it			0
i ask myself , “ what is the connection to opera ? ” it 's very strange			0
' ' i saw the demonstrations on the news , ' she continues			0
' i ask myself if it has an anti-semitic message , @entity294 , or @entity295 , or if we 're over-sensitive			0
' she pauses then wonders out loud : ' i just do n't know , but it might be that the bigger picture might have ruined their story			0
' outrage : @entity302 , left , was never brought to justice and @entity65 , right , was freed in 2008 she offers a final thought for those considering enjoying a night at the opera by taking in ' the death of @entity7 '			1
' they need to understand that @entity65 , the one that was supposed to be released [ by the hijacking of the @entity14 ] , was a cold - blooded murderer that acted against an innocent family at night			1
there 's nothing heroic , or brave about that			0

death of @entity7 opera drew protests when staged at @entity321 last week . critics say it glamorizes 1985 @entity11 terrorist hijacking
but @entity54 widow is angry production does n't make reference to the murder of her family at hands of terrorists in 1979 - which led to @entity14 attack
hijackers demanded the release of @entity65 , who shot dead her husband and smashed her daughter 's skull with a rifle butt
@entity82 tragically smothered their other daughter to death as they hid from @entity347 in a crawl space in their home
