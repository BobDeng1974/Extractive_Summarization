and now @entity5 women are shelling out up to $ 3000 to learn how to do it			1
the @entity7 have turned the art of contouring , a technique that involves highlighting and shadowing the face , from a make up insider secret to something many women - and some men - have tried to master			1
the demand to learn the secret to a flawless face is so high in @entity5 that one @entity20 make up artist is in the country this week to teach sold - out workshops in @entity24 and @entity25			1
the 30 - year - old was flown here to teach the the techniques used by @entity0 and @entity2 's ' glam squads ' to groups of women who have shelled out up to $ 3000 each for a three - day master class			1
@entity39 spoke to @entity52 during her @entity24 workshop , which will be followed this week by more sold - out classes in @entity25			1
eager to learn : @entity5 women are embracing the trend , and some have shelled out up to $ 3000 for a master class this week to learn from a top @entity20 make up artist tricks of the trade : make up artist @entity39 ( pictured ) says that ' 90 per cent ' of her students and clients request contouring ' contouring is really popular over here , ' she says			1
' i always ask what the class wants to learn and right now contouring is 90 per cent of the feedback i get			1
' my students who are make up artists tell me their clients come to them asking about contouring			1
the average consumer knows about contouring , but does n’t have the knowledge to do it themselves			2
' while the @entity7 are largely responsible for alerting the masses to the magic of contouring , @entity39 credits @entity2 with pioneering the trend - even if her fans did n't know she was doing it at the time			1
' @entity86 – it started with her			0
@entity87 , her former make up artist , created and then became a master of contouring , ' @entity39 says			1
' and then he became @entity0 ’s make up artist , and she started carrying that look as well			1
' makeover : @entity39 shares her contouring technique with @entity52 before and after : the contouring technique can give the illusion of a different face shape , sculpted jawline and cheekbones 1			1
start with applying your foundation as normal 2			0
next take a peach - hued concealer , approximately two shades lighter than your skin and apply under the eyes to highlight , blending as you go 3			2
use the same concealer on the straight bridge of the nose , middle of the forehead and centre of the chin ( think everywhere the light catches ) and blend , blend , blend 4			0
next , take a contouring cream two shades darker than your foundation sculpt the face : @entity119 , highlighters and contouring creams are used 5			1
swirl some of the contouring cream onto a brush and start by outlining around the hairline			2
this should look like you are ‘ framing ’ the face			2
blend the contouring ‘ in ’ ( starting from the outside of the face and blending inwards ) 6			1
finish the ‘ frame ’ by sweeping the colour under the jawline			0
trace the contour cream below the cheekbones , creating a triangle of colour that points to the corner of the lips 8			0
take some more colour and contour on either side of the bridge of the nose and also in the crease of the eyelid 9			0
the final step is to blend , blend , blend using a foundation brush to ensure there are no firm lines illusion : contouring can be used to slim a face , hide a double chin , and highlight cheek bones so , what is contouring exactly ? ' it ’s not just drawing lines on your face			2
it ’s about bringing out certain features we want and receding features we do n’t want to show so much , ' @entity39 tells @entity52			2
' if you have a double chin , you can contour it to make you look a little bit slimmer – it ’s an illusion			0
you ’re sculpting your features			0
' ' the ideal shaped face is the oval shape , so if you do n’t have that , you can contour your face in certain areas to create the illusion of the oval shape , and to bring out the features			0
' @entity179 's clients have become savvy about contouring			0
' a few years ago , when i ’d ask my clients what they want to do with their make up , they would say they wanted a smoky eye , some liner , lashes			0
now it ’s just about contour			0
they do n’t care what you do with their eyes or lips , as long as they have contour			0
@entity196 : @entity2 was an early adopter of contouring ' the bridal industry has taken this turn where the bride wants to feel like a celebrity the day of her wedding - all eyes on them			1
they want to feel like a @entity0 , they want to feel perfect			2
' celebrities have embraced the art of contouring because it helps them photograph flawlessly			2
but how does it translate to real life ? with heavy duty contouring taking up to an hour , @entity39 says there are a few short cut methods that can be adapted for everyday			1
' a woman should n’t spend longer than 15 minutes getting ready in the morning			0
you do n’t need to highlight and contour every day			0
' a simpler technique is with a powder bronzer , which you can use in the same way as a contour , it ’s easier , on the go , and you do n’t need to sit there and blend it for an hour			0
all you really need is some good base – tinted moisturiser or foundation , some bronzer so you do n’t look pale , blush , and you ’re good to go			0
in demand : professional make up artist @entity39 has over 840,000 @entity38 followers and celebrity clients there are a few different contouring methods , says @entity39			1
' you can use heavier creams , which are great for photo shoots but not if you want your make up to last all day			2
there are also thinner , more liquid creams , which have more staying power			0
' and for @entity5 's humid climate , where woman are regularly victims to their carefully applied make up slipping off in the heat , @entity179 recommends a powder base			1
' for people with oily skin or if you live in a humid climate , you want to go with powder contouring versus cream contouring , ' she advises			0
' you ’re still going to get the same look , but with a lighter texture and feel on the skin			0
