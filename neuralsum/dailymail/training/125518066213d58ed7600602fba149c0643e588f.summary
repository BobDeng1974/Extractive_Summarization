by @entity0 @entity1 , billionaire star of the infamous queen of @entity4 documentary , has shared a horrifying photo of her face following a laser skin treatment			1
mrs @entity1 , a 48 - year - old mother - of - eight based in @entity8 , @entity9 , arranged the procedure as a special treat for herself , to ' celebrate ' the end of a long - running lawsuit her husband @entity14 has been embroiled in , but had a severe allergic reaction to the laser			1
' @entity1 freaked when she saw her face , and went back to the doc , who assured her everything was okay , ' reports @entity20			0
' she says it took a long , painful week for the swelling to go down , but her face did return to normal			0
' ouch ! @entity1 , 48 , has shared a selfie showing the severe allergic reaction she suffered from a recent skin laser procedure , after which her doctor assured her that everything would ' be okay ' after : mrs @entity1 arranged the procedure as a special treat for herself , to ' celebrate ' the end of a lawsuit her husband @entity14 has been embroiled in , and fortunately the swelling subsided after a week ( pictured ) the photo shows mrs @entity1 's aggressively red face covered in blotches and peeling skin reaching from her décolletage to her forehead , and upon closer inspection , her 79 - year - old husband pottering around half - nude in the background			1
the former @entity44 @entity9 beauty queen also released a selfie of her face after the reaction had calmed down , in which her skin is pink , plump and almost entirely wrinkle free			1
it 's been a challenging few years for the @entity1 family			1
they achieved widespread fame in 2012 following the critical acclaim of @entity56 ; a documentary that followed them as they embarked on building the largest house in @entity61			2
reality star : mrs @entity1 ( pictured ) , her husband , and their brood of eight , achieved widespread fame in 2012 following their documentary , which followed them as they embarked on building the largest house in @entity61 under construction : @entity71 through filming however , the credit crunch hit , leading them to try and sell the $ 100million @entity9 mansion ( pictured )			1
the house remains unfinished and unsold two years on now that looks familiar : the results of mrs @entity1 's mishap do not look dissimilar to those of @entity80 ' character in @entity81 ( pictured ) after she underwent a chemical peel things took a turn , however , when the economy crashed and mr @entity14 , billionaire founder of timeshare company @entity86 , had something of a financial nightmare on his hands			0
he was then forced to list the 13 - bedroom , 11 - kitchen , 30 - bathroom , 90,000 - square - foot mansion for sale ; all of which appeared in the documentary			0
the @entity1 couple , whose eight children range in age from seven to 20 , did not end up with the sort of fame they had been hoping for , and subsequently launched a lawsuit against the documentary 's filmmakers for ' defamation ' over their ' riches - to - rags ' portrayal			2
ultimately , the @entity1 camp lost , and two years on , their $ 100million mega mansion is still unfinished and unsold			2
mrs @entity1 , perhaps on a mission to throw the family into a more positive light next time around , signed a development deal in march with @entity112 for a new reality tv show			0
' i hope they will just let me be me and let me do my own thing , ' she told the @entity117 earlier this month			0
' i think that ’s what people that saw the movie really liked , because it was real , whereas reality can be somewhat scripted			0

the painful effects were the result of an allergic reaction
the former @entity44 @entity9 beauty queen starred in the 2012 queen of @entity4 documentary
it followed the @entity1 family as they built @entity61 's largest family home , valued at $ 100million
