@entity1 @entity0 grew up in a specialist boarding school in the tourist village of @entity5 after their parents both died a former teacher of the brothers who attacked a magazine office in @entity11 said the boys were more interested in football than religion at school but were too dim - witted to avoid extremists after they left			1
@entity1 , 34 , and @entity0 , 32 , murdered 12 people in central @entity11 last week before fleeing to a print works where they were shot by armed police while saying they were ready to ' die as martyrs			1
' but a former teacher who helped to raise the orphaned pair at a school in the holiday village of @entity5 recalls them as happy , popular and trustworthy children who had little interest in religion			1
@entity1 and @entity2 , who are of @entity32 - @entity31 descent , were sent to the @entity34 centre in the picturesque @entity35 in 1994 by their mother , who was unable to raise them after their father died suddenly			1
once at the boarding school , which specialises is raising children with social needs , they were largely isolated from the outside world			1
there they took up sports , showing a passion for football , while also taking regular lessons			2
@entity52 , a retired biology teacher from the school , grew particularly fond of @entity2			1
he was not especially bright , she said , but showed a willingness to learn			0
she had fewer dealings with @entity1 , @entity2 's older brother , but said his level of intellect was ' low '			1
she said that she noticed @entity1 praying but that religion did not form a large part of his upbringing			1
while the boys were in school their mother died and when the time came for them to leave at age 18 they had no family to return to			1
instead they moved together to a council apartment in @entity11 's poor 19th arrondissement where they fell into a life of drug dealing and petty crime before being taken in by the @entity74 gang			2
@entity52 , a former teacher at the school , recalled @entity2 ( left ) as a well behaved boy who loved football and did n't practice religion			1
she said his brother @entity1 ( right ) had a ' low ' intellect and prayed occasionally when the brothers left the isolated school they returned to @entity11 where they were taken in by an extremist gang the group , which also included deli attacker @entity86 , 32 , was lead by two radical @entity87 who preached jihad			1
speaking about @entity2 's move to @entity11 , ms @entity52 told @entity91 : ' he joined up with little groups of hooligans			0
they ran rings around him because he was relatively fragile and allowed himself to be led by the nose			0
' i think it 's from then on that he started spending time in the mosques			0
but when he was at college in @entity102 he had nothing to do with religion			0
i do n't think he was a practising muslim			0
@entity106 , a janitor - turned - preacher who lead the @entity74 gang is the extremist preacher credited with radicalising the @entity108 ' as for his brother , @entity1 , his level of intellect was very low			1
i think he used to pray			0
when i saw the photos on the tv , i was really very surprised the boys turned out like that			2
' it was a cleric named @entity106 , a janitor - turned - preacher , who was responsible for radicalising the boys , teaching that waging jihad was a way to get closer to @entity118			1
both of the brothers were questioned in 2005 over their links to the @entity74 gang after it began sending groups of young men to @entity125 who never returned			0
neither of them were formally charged but in 2008 @entity2 was brought back to court after he was caught trying to get on a flight to @entity131 with an operating manual for an @entity133			0
@entity2 , who had married a woman named @entity135 the same year , was sent to jail for three years , though he only served 18 months before being released			0
while inside he began working out and met another radical cleric named @entity138 , who had previously attended the @entity140 mosque @entity141 preached at			2
after being freed from prison , @entity2 was photographed by @entity32 intelligence visiting @entity144 in @entity145 in central @entity32 in april 2010			1
despite his radically altered persona , it seems he never lost his childhood passion for football , as he was also videoed kicking a ball around with three suspected extremists			0
later that year , @entity2 was arrested for a third time over a plot to break @entity154 out of jail after he was imprisoned for life over the bombing of a @entity11 railway station in 1995			0
police papers filed at the time also make mention of @entity1 , though officers later decided there was not enough evidence to charge the pair			2
another member of @entity74 was @entity86 , 32 , who shot a policewoman dead in @entity11 the day after the @entity167 attacked , before killing four more in a @entity169 supermarket @entity170 is known about what became of the brothers between that date and last week 's massacre at the offices of @entity176			0
@entity32 security sources have suggested that the brothers could have been in @entity178 as recently as last year , while it is also thought the pair could have travelled to @entity181 where they received military training while serving with @entity183			2
@entity2 is believed to have had at least one child in that time			0
@entity1 married @entity185 in @entity11 in march 2012 and has at least two children .			2

@entity1 and @entity0 were raised in boarding school in central @entity32
@entity190 sent there by their mother in 1994 after their father died suddenly
