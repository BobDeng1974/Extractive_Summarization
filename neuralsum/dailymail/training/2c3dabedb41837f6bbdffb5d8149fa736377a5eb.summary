pulling hard on a cigarette as she sauntered down the road , the unkempt brunette in the hoodie barely drew a glance from photographers outside @entity7 ’s nightclub in @entity8 last week			2
the flashbulbs duly exploded into action for @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and many more			1
but what of the girl in the tracksuit and grubby trainers ? she would have looked more at home begging for change			0
it was only when her companion was refused entry to the club , sparking an unseemly argument with door staff , that the penny dropped			0
this was no beggar ; it was @entity31 , mother - of - three and heiress to one of the world ’s most illustrious — and notorious — banking dynasties , with her rapper boyfriend , the extravagantly monikered @entity36			1
‘ to be quite frank i was shocked when i saw the pictures , ’ a long - standing family friend of the @entity38 told me this week			1
‘ one tries not to jump to conclusions , but when she goes out looking like that it is terribly worrying			0
dishevelled : @entity31 with @entity36 last week ‘ the past 18 months have been particularly difficult for @entity44 had been hoping that things would settle down , but she is increasingly out of reach			1
fundamentally , she is a wonderful girl with a sensible head on her shoulders			0
she ’s also a great mum			1
but there is a wild , creative side which has a tendency to give everyone around her sleepless nights			0
‘ from what i hear of the events the other day , they made quite a spectacle of themselves			0
what was she thinking ? ’ indeed , @entity31 ’s life has undergone a total transformation since 2005 , when she was happy to describe herself as a housewife			1
now she is a rock chick , hanging out with rappers			1
it is certainly hard to believe that tuesday ’s apparition is the stunning girl who lit up the gossip columns a decade ago in the society wedding of the year			1
the marriage of of @entity72 and @entity31 ended in divorce in april 2013			1
@entity11 , then 21 , was a vision of understated beauty as she wed @entity72 bringing together two of @entity78 's most fabulously wealthy dynasties @entity11 , then 21 , was a vision of understated beauty with flowers in her hair as she wed @entity72 , bringing together two of @entity78 ’s most fabulously wealthy dynasties			1
he was worth £ 300 million ; his bride a comparatively paltry £ 18 million			0
now , her marriage destroyed , she spends her life trying to control a wannabe rapper			1
as @entity36 ’s manager , @entity11 , 31 , has had to fit in with him — swapping designer dresses and jolly lunches for tracksuits and snatched cigarettes outside recording studios			1
meanwhile , @entity36 , who has a daughter by a previous relationship and a penchant for marijuana and @entity97 , has introduced her to life a world away from her comfortable upbringing			1
when they go out partying , which is often , @entity36 likes to make an impression			0
his reputation is as a man who does n’t care who he offends — a trait that many blame for his failure thus far to turn talent into record sales			0
a smitten @entity11 , however , feels he can do no wrong			1
witness the events of last week , when @entity36 , 37 , ( real name @entity36 ) demonstrated that while you can take the rapper out of the deprived housing projects of @entity120 , a questionable legacy remains			0
@entity11 's marriage spectacularly imploded in 2012 after @entity72 uncovered her year - long affair with @entity36 after reading texts between the two ‘ he got into a massive argument with the bouncers because they would n’t let him into the club , ’ says a witness to the fracas , which ended with the couple being admitted			1
then , when they left , @entity36 was clearly the worse for wear because he started trying to open car doors , saying he was going to drive them home			0
@entity11 had to drag him away			1
‘ then he got into another argument — i think it was something to do with the ridiculous shorts and knee - high socks he was wearing — and @entity11 just leaned against a car , looking fed up			1
‘ eventually , they headed off home , but not with any dignity			0
’ @entity143 was so angry when he uncovered @entity11 's affair that he is alleged to have slapped her and kicked a child 's toy at her @entity147 , sadly , has been in short supply since @entity11 ’s marriage spectacularly imploded in 2012 after @entity72 uncovered her year - long affair with @entity36 after reading texts between the two			1
he was so angry that he is alleged to have slapped her and kicked a child ’s toy at her			2
cue the police being summoned and a hugely unedifying public spat on @entity154 , which culminated in divorce			0
since then , @entity11 ’s life has changed almost beyond recognition			1
always interested in the performing arts , she had been dabbling in the music industry and had set up her own business , @entity161 , for whom @entity36 was a star client , before the marriage broke down			2
she has now swapped life within the @entity166 society bubble for a more chaotic existence with @entity36			2
a number of society invitations have been discreetly withdrawn , not least because many of her and @entity72 ’s mutual friends were unimpressed by the public manner of their split			1
‘ @entity11 leads a dual life , ’ adds the family friend			1
‘ she is a fantastic mother , utterly dedicated to her three children , but when not on mummy duty she and @entity36 have a very different lifestyle			0
‘ when i met him i found him perfectly charming			0
in a curious way , he ’s not at all dissimilar to @entity180 because he is very passionate and articulate in an unconventional manner			2
‘ he ’s a peacock , but a very masculine peacock			2
whereas @entity72 is socially confident and comfortable dealing with huge financial deals , he would n’t be able to change a tyre			0
@entity36 could strip down the entire engine and put it back together			0
i think @entity11 finds that exciting			1
there is a passion in this relationship which was sadly lacking with @entity72 , for all that they were best friends			2
’ like @entity180 — currently in a relationship with @entity11 ’s erstwhile sister - in - law , @entity192 — @entity36 is not your typical ‘ bit of rough ’			1
his home , secured with the assistance of his ever - attentive manager , @entity11 , is a fifth - floor apartment in @entity199			1
the few who have been invited in speak of a minimalist space with record decks , ashtrays ( he and @entity11 are unreconstructed smokers ) and bookshelves lined with weighty tomes including @entity208 ’s @entity207 and @entity209			1
@entity11 shares @entity36 's social conscience and believes his brand of spiritual rap can make a difference to the world @entity36 nips around @entity166 on a motor scooter and spends the evenings at gigs with his girlfriend			1
@entity11 , who lives with her three children in a £ 20 million mansion in nearby @entity221 , likes nothing more than to drop round to @entity223 and cook dinner			1
‘ it ’s not like they ’re jetting around the world and he ’s hanging on her coat tails , ’ adds the friend			1
‘ they ’re living quite a basic existence and he ’s very old - fashioned — when they go out , he pays his way			2
‘ it ’s his combination of incredible talent and unassuming manner which appeals to @entity11			1
she ’s a thoroughly nice girl who just wants to be normal			2
she loves urban music , and she ’d far rather go to @entity238 ’s than sit in a vip suite sipping @entity240 and chatting to chinless wonders			2
‘ they ’re both square pegs in round holes			0
perhaps that ’s what has kept them together through everything			0
’ certainly , they have weathered more storms than anyone expected			0
last year , rumours abounded of an impending split when @entity36 was said to be spending time chatting up @entity253 and her fellow models			0
today , @entity11 is happily divorced , combining motherhood with her new life			1
family time is , in the words of a well - heeled contemporary , ‘ a life of @entity263 costumes , cupcakes and play - dates ’			2
those who have observed her at close quarters say she is following her heart			0
@entity11 is understood to believe that were it not for her illustrious surname , she would have followed a different path			2
she shares @entity36 ’s social conscience and believes his brand of spiritual rap can make a difference to the world			2
in @entity279 , many influential figures still have high hopes for him			0
@entity282 ’s husband @entity281 , the billionaire overlord of rap , has signed him up			2
yet for all his undoubted talent , he has yet to produce the goods			0
his debut album has been so long awaited it has become an industry joke			0
occasionally , he gets drunk and takes to @entity154 railing against his critics			0
his reputation as a womaniser is enhanced by the fact he has a daughter with @entity294 , the @entity295 - winning singer			0
sadly , he has never seen much of the little girl , who lives in @entity298 ’s faith in @entity36 seems unshakeable , but her music business is still to take off			0
according to her company accounts , @entity161 had stocks of £ 1,885 and cash of £ 761 , but owes @entity11 £ 365,606			2
looking on the bright side , her relationship with her ex-husband has improved markedly as they share custody and strive to do their best for the children			0
while @entity72 , 33 , remains hurt by her behaviour , he , too , has moved on and lives near to the family home with his new partner , @entity315 , 26 , a lingerie model now working as a film producer			0
it is a conventional life , but he is happy			0
whether the same can be said of @entity11 is questionable .			2

@entity31 is a mum and heiress to a world famous banking dynasty
her life has undergone a total transformation since 2005
used to be a housewife ; now she is a rock chick , hanging out with rappers
her behaviour is ' shocking ' her friends
@entity11 ’s marriage blew up in 2012 as husband uncovered her year - long affair
