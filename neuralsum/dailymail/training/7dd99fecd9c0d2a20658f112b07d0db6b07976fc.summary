by @entity0 the pressure of the @entity2 coming to its final stretch does n't seem to be getting to the @entity5 players as they took part in a spot of tennis football during training			1
their @entity2 semi-final showdown with @entity11 will go a long way to determining whether @entity13 is to gain hero status like @entity15			1
but it is n't all work and no play in @entity20 's camp , as they made time to fit in a bit of fun over the net days after @entity25 came to an end at @entity27			2
as if @entity13 needed any more motivation , the @entity60 maestro could become the tournament 's top goalscorer with a hat - trick against the @entity65			2
the 27 - year - old , though , has competition from @entity45 's @entity44 , who faces @entity41 on tuesday			0
the current top goalscorer - @entity43 's @entity42 - was knocked out by the host nation			0
the potential for a @entity41 vs @entity28 @entity2 final is tempting , but @entity72 must orchestrate a win over @entity75 's confident @entity11 team first			1
@entity11 saw off @entity76 on penalties in the quarter - finals - a shoot - out which told the world a lot about @entity83 's tactical genius			0
the new @entity85 manager hauled off first - choice goalkeeper @entity87 for the penalties alone , bringing on @entity90 's @entity89 , who became an instant hero by saving two spot - kicks			0
