by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 a 64 - year - old ' nightmare nanny ' who stopped working for the @entity7 family that hired her and refused to move out is finally ready to leave their home , it has emerged			1
@entity12 said that @entity13 contacted the family 's lawyer on saturday night and said she could be out of their @entity17 home , near @entity19 , by july 4			1
' she would like to move out but because of the hot weather that 's going to happen soon , ' mrs @entity12 told people			1
but the mom - of - three does n't think the battle is over just yet because the family is scheduled to go on vacation on july 2			1
good riddance : @entity13 , 64 , has told her former employers that she will leave their home before july 4 - weeks after she moved in and stopped carrying out work for them ' i feel like it 's a trap , ' she said			1
' i feel like she knows that i 'm going to be gone and that she wants to lock me out of my home			2
' mrs @entity12 and her husband had hired in march through @entity34 to do chores and watch their young children in return for room and board in their home			1
mrs @entity12 said she had called previous employers to get references and saw no problems			2
but they became exasperated after she stopped working within weeks , said she had chronic pulmonary disease , ignored repeated requests to leave , and made them scared for their property and the safety of their children , aged one , four and 11			1
the family also said the woman , who had been homeless before she moved in with them , threatened to sue them for wrongful termination and elder abuse			0
stumped : @entity12 and @entity57 with their three children , ages , 11 , 4 and one police declined to intervene in a civil matter because the employment agreement included giving her a place to live , so the couple launched an eviction process , which they feared could take months			1
police say that once a person establishes residency they must be ' formally evicted ' under @entity7 law , a process that could lead to a court - ordered ' forcible eviction ' carried out by county sheriff 's deputies			1
the family previously spoke out about their exasperation in the case			0
' the first few weeks she was awesome , ' said @entity12 to @entity82 about her squatter			2
' she would come places with us , help out the kids			0
' all of a sudden she stopped working , she would stay in her room all day and only come out when food was ready			1
' serious problems began on june 6 when they came to her with what they called a ' last chance letter ' , which outlined the terms of their initial agreement and threatening her with eviction if she continued to do nothing			0
@entity13 refused to sign it and said that she would be leaving in 30 days anyway as the stress of the job had become too much for her			1
legal problems : the @entity102 's have said that they ca n't believe the battle to have @entity13 removed careful : mrs @entity12 , pictured with her children , said she carried out background checks on the woman at this point they asked her to leave and served her with legal papers , but @entity13 counter-sued and a judge ruled in her favor because the @entity102 's did not complete a three - day quit notice correctly			1
' when i asked her why she would n’t sign the letter she said " it ’s not legal , " and slammed the door in my face , ' @entity12 told @entity82			2
' once she said the word legal , i knew it was n’t going to be fun			0
' police told the @entity102 's there was nothing they could do			1
' they told me it was now a civil matter , ' @entity12 said , ' and i have to legally evict her , ' said @entity12 to @entity126			2
' so this lady is welcome inside my house , anytime she wants , to eat my food anytime she wants and harass me basically			0
i ’m now a victim in my home and it ’s completely legal			0
' with the laws against them , the family had few options			0
due to the agreement , they were legally obligated to provide her somewhere to stay and could not disrupt her			0
on one occasion , the 64 - year - old called police for turning up the television too loud			2
hiding out : last week , the former nanny was seen camped out in her car outside a police station on the move : @entity13 used to live out of her silver @entity148 ( pictured ) for days at a time and as the @entity102 's discovered , this was not the first time that @entity13 - who was homeless before she was hired - has clashed in the courts with families			1
she has been involved in 36 lawsuits , ensuring she has made @entity7 's @entity155 list , for abusing the system			1
' anyone who looks at her crooked , she sues , ' said @entity12			2
documents reveal that she tried to block her two sisters from selling family property after her father ' specifically and expressly omitted @entity13 ' from his will and even sued her own son , @entity163 , for property damage and personal injury			2
but it also emerged that the woman was homeless before she was hired by the family			0
@entity169 , a friend of the rogue nanny , told @entity171 : ' she ’s been homeless for about nine years			0
she was staying in the homeless shelter ( @entity173 ) in @entity174			0
' she was struggling and looking for another place and i said check @entity34 , they always have all kinds of odd stuff on there			0
she found the nanny job and i encouraged her to go for it			0
' @entity13 has even filed paperwork to try and force the @entity185 of their own home , pictured here @entity169 , who lived in the same apartment block as @entity13 's son , @entity163 , and began collecting her mail for her when he moved to @entity191 , even provided a reference for her friend			1
' she got an interview with the lady and went out there and saw her			0
she used me as a personal reference and she had another friend from the shelter as a personal reference , ' said @entity169			0
' i spoke to the woman @entity12 , i recommended @entity13 as a good person , as a nanny and as someone you can trust			1
' she 's very professional , she 's got a master ’s degree in something , i think it 's biochemistry			0
but she has health issues , osteoporosis and arthritis			0
' @entity13 recently lost her spot at the homeless shelter and was living in her car with a suitcase of her possessions , @entity169 explained			2
it is not clear where she will go now that she is leaving the family 's home .			1

@entity13 , 64 , refused to leave the home of @entity12 and @entity102 in @entity17 , @entity7 after she stopped working for them
police have said that because @entity13 was *invited* into the home and has established residency they are unable to do anything
she has now contacted the couple 's lawyers to say she will be leaving the home before july 4
but the family are scheduled to go on vacation on july 2 and fear that she will now lock them out of their home
