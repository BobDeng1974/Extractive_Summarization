in a terrifying radio exchange just before landing a massive 235 ft cargo plane at the wrong , and tiny , @entity2 airport late on wednesday , the pilot sounded confused			1
the man could be heard mixing up east and west , saying he could not read his own handwriting and getting distracted from the conversation by ' looking at something else			1
' moments after touching down , when puzzled controllers told the pilot that he was 9 miles north of his intended destination , he made an unusual admission			1
' uh , yes sir , we just landed at the other airport			1
there are three airports in close proximity , including @entity40 , which is believed to have caused the pilot confusion his calm , understated response belied the danger of the situation : the mammoth , @entity21 aircraft had just landed on the wrong stretch of concrete , miles from its planned path , in the dark			1
the runway just happened to be long enough to land			0
fortunately the plane took off without incident on thursday and landed at its intended destination			1
the @entity55 747 , flown by a two - person crew with no passengers , intended to touch down late wednesday at @entity27 in @entity58			2
it it was supposed to deliver parts for @entity55 's new @entity62 to a nearby company that makes large sections of the next - generation jet			2
belly of the beast : @entity55 employees wait to unload the super freighter ' dreamlifter ' aircraft			0
the tail of the specially designed 747 freighter swings open for huge payloads that are unloaded using one of the largest cargo loaders in the world media interest : tv crews at the tiny airfield in @entity2 where the huge plane got stranded overnight instead , the cargo plane landed to the north , at the smaller col. @entity83			1
the jet took off again thursday and within minutes landed at its original destination			1
the crew had flown into an area where there are three airports with similar runway configurations : the @entity92 base , the @entity25 airfield and a third facility in between called @entity95			0
that could help explain the mistake			0
pilots also say it can be tough to tell a long runway from a shorter one on final approach			0
and @entity25 is directly on the path toward @entity27 , so the only difference would be that a pilot on final approach would reach it a little sooner			2
while it is rare for a pilot to land at the wrong airport , occasional confusion is not unusual			1
every month or two , a pilot headed toward @entity58 's @entity112 begins to turn toward @entity27 by mistake , said @entity114 , a former air traffic controller in @entity58 who is now an assistant professor at @entity117 in @entity118 , @entity119 attention attractor : people flocked to see the huge jet and @entity55 had to dispatch a tug to turn the jet around mammoth : the super freighter @entity21 aircraft , carrying the massive wings for the first ever @entity62 , is towed into position in may 2007 in this file photo mid-continent and @entity27 ' have an almost identical runway setup , so it was not at all uncommon for an airliner or someone coming in from the east ... to pick up the wrong runway lights , ' he said			1
it happened often enough that ' we would always watch for that , and we could always correct the pilot			2
' @entity25 's 6,100 - foot runway is toward the low end of what @entity55 recommends for the 747			0
how much runway the plane needs varies depending on weather , the weight of the loaded plane and the airport 's elevation			1
@entity55 owns the plane involved in the mistaken landing , but it 's operated by @entity155 , a @entity156 - based company that provides crews or planes to companies			1
an @entity155 spokeswoman declined to answer questions and referred inquiries to @entity55			0
@entity55 spokesman @entity163 said the company would be consulting with @entity155 to ' find out exactly what happened so that it does n't happen again			2
' the @entity166 planned to investigate whether the pilot followed controllers ' instructions or violated any regulations			0
squeeze : @entity25 's 6,100 - foot runway is toward the low end of what @entity55 recommends for the 747 after the pilot concluded he had landed at the wrong airport , the crew and controllers tried to figure out where the plane was			1
at one point , a controller read to the pilot the coordinates where he saw the plane on radar			1
when the pilot read the coordinates back , he mixed up east and west			1
' sorry about that , could n't read my handwriting , ' the pilot said on a recording provided by liveatc.net			1
a few moments later , the pilot asked how many airports there are to the south of @entity27			0
but the other airports are both north of @entity27			0
' i 'm sorry , i meant north , ' the pilot said when corrected			2
i 'm looking at something else			0
' they finally agreed on where the plane was after the pilot reported that a smaller plane , visible on the radar of air traffic control , had just flown overhead			2
the modified 747 is one of a fleet of four that hauls parts around the world to make the @entity62			0
known as the ' @entity21 , ' it features an expanded body to carry whole fuselage sections and other large parts			0
if a regular 747 with its bulbous double - decker nose looks like a snake , the overstuffed @entity21 looks like a snake that swallowed a rat			0
surprise ! the @entity55 747 , flown by a two - person crew , intended to touch down late wednesday at @entity27 in @entity58			0
according to flight - tracking service @entity225 , this particular @entity21 has been shuttling between @entity2 and @entity227 , where the center fuselage section and part of the tail of the 787 are made			2
@entity231 , which is next to @entity27 , completes the sections and sends them to @entity55 plants in @entity234 and @entity235 for assembly into finished jets			0
almost a decade ago , a @entity239 plane bound for @entity240 , @entity241 , with 117 passengers landed instead at nearby @entity243			2
as the plane descended through clouds , one of the pilots reported , the crew saw a runway in front of them and mistakenly thought it was the right one			0
last year , a cargo plane bound for @entity254 in @entity255 , @entity256 , landed without incident at the small @entity258 nearby			1
an investigation blamed confusion identifying airports in the area , and base officials introduced an updated landing procedure .			0

pilot who landed huge cargo jet at wrong airport 9 miles north of intended destination in @entity2 sounded confused on radio before landing
he mixed up east and west , then said ' sorry about that , could n't read my handwriting ' on recording
huge plane eventually escaped *colonel* @entity83 on thursday
