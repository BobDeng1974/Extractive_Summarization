by @entity0 published : 09:46 est , 15 april 2013 updated : 09:52 est , 15 april 2013 @entity1 looked blooming marvellous as the sun came out to play today			1
at last , flower growers got some joy as the @entity1 's only hyacinths bulb fields burst into bloom in @entity7 one month later than usual			2
in the @entity10 of @entity11 , in the @entity9 , asparagus growers finally started getting ready for the @entity12 on @entity13			2
but in @entity15 , @entity16 , they 're still waiting because the annual flowering of bluebells has n't quite happened yet			1
usually , by mid-april the ground at @entity20 is blanketed in blue but the unseasonal cold spell - which has also reduced @entity11 's asparagus crop to only 10 per cent of what it should be - has put paid to that			1
in the @entity7 countryside , the world 's largest collection of rare hyacinths is putting on a stunning display of colour in a fragrance - filled two - acre field after @entity45 finally sprung			1
@entity47 @entity46 , 75 , has been custodian of the @entity1 's @entity48 since 1989 and now has more than 150,000 flowering bulbs			1
' the hyacinths are a good four weeks later than usual due to the cold weather , but there has been no damage to the flowers , ' said mr @entity46			2
' it 's the next three months which are important now as the weather will affect the size of the bulbs			2
' we need plenty of sun to put energy into the bulbs , but we do n't want it to be too hot as it shortens the growing season			1
' @entity67 the dog playing amongst daffodils on the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 all smiles : @entity74 , three , and @entity75 , three , from @entity76 , enjoy a day out in @entity77 @entity78 : @entity74 and @entity75 playing in the sun in @entity77 , @entity76 , @entity80 forecasters say @entity82 in @entity83 is expected to be the hottest spot in the @entity1 today reaching an almost summery @entity85			1
@entity86 and @entity87 will reach @entity88 and @entity89 while @entity90 on the @entity91 will be the @entity1 's coolest place reaching just 5c			2
with the weather staying warm , @entity93 could reach @entity95 on wednesday			1
@entity97 literature student @entity96 enjoys some sun at last on the beach in @entity100 today with the north east experiencing temperatures around @entity88 in the @entity7 countryside , the world 's largest collection of rare hyacinths is putting on a stunning display of colour			1
pictured with them is eight - year - old @entity110 @entity46 in his field of hyacinths , which are finally beginning to burst into flower fun on the beach today despite slightly chilly temperatures at @entity115 , @entity116 while temperatures were n't exactly @entity118 , after a seemingly endless winter yesterday ’s warm weather was a good start			1
as predicted , it was the hottest day of the year so far with the thermometer peaking at @entity123 ( @entity124 ) in @entity125 and @entity126 in @entity127			2
it is hoped the widespread temperature increase will jolt @entity130 out of her unusually long hibernation			2
bluebells and some daffodils , which normally brighten the countryside and gardens with displays of colour , have yet to flower , while parks await the glorious burst of cherry blossom			0
as for the bird population , there are fears that a lack of insects may have had terrible consequences for the tens of thousands of migrating birds that usually reach @entity1 by the start of april			0
some birds may have delayed their journey north , but ornithologists fear thousands of birds that rely on insects for food may have arrived and died			0
@entity157 was expecting the ‘ main pulse ’ of migrating birds – including swallows and house martins – to arrive over the weekend with the help of strong southerly winds			1
but @entity163 of the @entity164 said : ‘ we ’re actually not sure where they all are			0
possibly many have already arrived and perished or they may be hanging around waiting for the right conditions			1
’ he added : ‘ when they arrive they are exhausted			0
they have probably lost half their body weight and are right on the edge of survival			0
‘ if they arrive and there are no insects to feed on they are in big trouble			0
we could be looking at a bleak picture			0
’ bluebells are one wonder of the @entity12 countryside that have yet to appear			0
it is thought peak flowering could be delayed until mid-may this year			1
there are also fears that many daffodils may not flower at all			0
@entity189 , curator of @entity191 ’s @entity190 , said : ‘ it ’s possible the bulbs have been damaged by the prolonged wet , and then very cold weather			0
some of them could have rotted or died off in the soil			0
’ however , experts suggest the late spring could be a sign of an increasingly rare hot summer			0
@entity201 , a naturalist for the @entity157 , said : ‘ there is a really good link between late springs and very good summers , and we are due , overdue , a very good summer			0
’ a @entity208 spokesman said : ‘ temperatures will drop a bit tomorrow but it will stay generally mild			1

usually , by now the ground at @entity20 , @entity16 , is blanketed in blue
but they 're still waiting because the annual flowering has n't happened
warmth is set to continue through the week , says the @entity208
temperatures should remain around the *mid-teens* - though it wo n't be *dry*
the sun should *return* by *friday* for a warm weekend after mixed week
