it happens to us all – you fill up the kettle to make a quick cup of tea , and then have to wait ages for it to boil			2
but that frustration could soon be a thing of the past with a device that heats the exact amount of water you need for your cuppa ... by boiling it in the mug			0
this means that not only does the device save time , it also saves energy			2
to heat water , a mug is placed on a special induction plate and a magnetic metal rod is immersed in it			1
and if you have guests over and want to make more than one cup – just place your teapot on the device , called a @entity28 , and it works in the same energy - efficient way			2
according to the @entity53 , if everyone boiled only the water they need , they would save enough electricity to power the nation ’s street lights for two months			0
its makers also claim the @entity28 is quieter than a normal kettle and produces less limescale			1
and it works for any other liquids such as milk , and even soup			0
the @entity28 is the brainchild of young entrepreneurs @entity31 and @entity32 , former students of the @entity67 in the @entity68			1
they set out to redesign the kettle after realising the amount of energy that ’s wasted each time it is put on to boil and hailed @entity28 as an ‘ innovative product that eliminates the heating of excess water ’			1
efficient : @entity28 ( pictured ) could play a small role in energy conservation in the kitchen beacuse unlike a regular kettle , it only heats water that is needed			1
it can be used to heat any liquid , such as coffee and milk the @entity88 gadget uses induction to heat liquid			2
it comprises a metal rod , which is placed into a cup of liquid and an induction plate , which is used like a coaster underneath the cup			1
the base contains a coil though which a high frequency alternating current is passed and creates an electromagnetic field			1
the heat induced in this base - where ' eddy ' currents within the metal and resistance lead to it heating up - is transferred to the liquid in a cup via the metal rod inside it , which gets hot			1
induction heating is faster and more efficient that other methods and heats liquid more consistently			0
mr @entity116 , 23 , from @entity117 , @entity118 , said : ‘ @entity28 all started with looking at electric kettles and noticing they all look so similar			0
later , while researching electric kettles more closely , we noticed that there was a major design flaw			0
‘ they are extremely wastefully designed – the minimum fill line of the majority of kettles is at approximately 500ml which means that if you want one cup of tea , around 250ml , you waste 50 per cent of the hot water			0
' we set out to redesign the electric kettle from the ground up , to change people ’s habits of overfilling electric kettles in order to save energy			0
@entity28 is efficient because you only heat the amount of water you need saving time and energy			1
' there ’s no limescale to worry about and you can use it with any vessel and any liquid			0
’ the pair are now looking at ways of mass - producing their kettles , and hope to sell them for around £ 80 once they hit the shelves			0
quiet : the device is quieter than a normal kettle and produces less limescale , according to its inventors , @entity31 and @entity32			2
here , the two components - the metallic rod and induction plate - are pictured the inventors are looking at ways or producing their futuristic kettles on a mass scale - and hope to sell them for around £ 80			1
any non-metallic cup or vessel can be used with the gadget ( pictured )			0

@entity28 gadget comprises a metal rod , which is placed into a cup of liquid and an induction plate , which is used like a coaster
base creates an electromagnetic field , which causes the water around the rod to heat up , saving time and energy compared with a *traditional* kettle
gadget claims to be quieter and produce less limescale too
it was invented by former students of @entity67
