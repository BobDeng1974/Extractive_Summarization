a dog walker who spent two years thinking he owned a £ 100,000 piece of rare whale vomit has discovered the pungent rock is actually worthless			1
@entity5 thought he had found ' floating gold ' when he stumbled across what he believed was a 3kg lump of the highly sought - after ambergris on the beach in @entity11 , @entity12			1
but his dream of netting a small fortune has now been shattered after an expert in the @entity16 revealed the ' stone ' is not authentic ambergris - and has absolutely no value			1
the substance can then float around undiscovered for years in the water , where it hardens and develops into a smooth lump of compact rock which feels waxy and has a sweet smell			2
it is this aromatic quality which makes it is used in perfumes such as @entity45			0
mr @entity5 said : ' if i had my time over again , i would kick the rock to one side and walk away			1
i wish i 'd never found it			0
i 've got to accept what happened and get on with it			0
' the 52 - year - old was walking his boxer dog @entity24 along the beach in january 2013 when he stumbled across what he believed to be the rare item			1
the highly sought - after @entity28 , or ' grey amber ' , is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales , which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem ( file picture ) @entity28 is the intestinal slurry of sperm whales , which they eject into the ocean - usually when they have a stomach or throat problem			1
the substance can then float around undiscovered for years in the water , where it hardens and develops its distinctive odour			0
the decades of floating and exposure to sun and salt will then turn the matter into ambergris , a smooth lump of compact rock which feels waxy and has a sweet smell			1
it is that quality which means it is highly sought - after with perfume makers , who use it to prolong the scent of perfume			1
although ambergris is still an ingredient in perfumes today , producers usually remove it from their product because of the legal ambiguities surrounding its use			0
as it comes from sperm whale , which is classed as a vulnerable species , cosmetic companies tend to shun using it because it is associated with whaling			0
but the sweet - smelling sick has been used in a variety of other ways throughout history			0
ancient @entity108 reportedly found a use for it by burning ambergris as incense			2
the country still uses it today for scenting cigarettes			0
during the @entity117 in @entity118 , worried people also thought they could thwart the plague by carrying a ball of ambergris because the vomit masked the smell , which they thought was the root of the illness			2
it is rarely found on @entity128 beaches , usually being washed up in @entity16 and @entity129			2
a @entity131 dealer offered him 50,000 euros if it turned out to be real , while some experts said it could be worth double that quote			0
but the true value of the stone was discovered when documentary maker @entity137 -- who produced a radio 4 show called @entity5 , @entity24 and the @entity139 following the find - sent a sample to an expert across the @entity142			1
@entity143 , an @entity16 author who wrote a book about ambergris , then broke the news that it was definitely not whale vomit			2
to add to mr @entity5 's heartbreak , his beloved dog has also passed away since he made the discovery			1
mr @entity137 said : ' he ( @entity143 ) emailed me back and said it 's definitely not ambergris , although he did n't know what it was			2
' then i had a text from @entity5 telling me @entity24 had died			1
he was in complete shock and then i had to tell him it was n't real ambergris			0
' mr @entity137 has since contacted a dealer in @entity161 who has promised to send mr @entity5 a 2g piece of real ambergris			1
although it is virtually worthless , mr @entity5 is delighted at the gesture			1
he said : ' when @entity137 told me , i nearly broke down			0
i cant believe there are nice people in the world , like this lady , who feels sorry for me and wants to send me a piece of ambergris			0
' i 've kept a level head about things and i 'm trying to find humour in the situation			0
' although it is rarely found on @entity128 beaches , eight - year - old @entity176 discovered a 600g piece after taking a stroll along @entity181 , near @entity182 in 2012			2
beachcombers @entity183 and , 24 , and @entity185 , 39 , also discovered a 110lb of whale vomit washed up on the beach in @entity189 , @entity190 , in 2008			0
in 2006 a couple walking on an @entity129 beach found a 32 - pound chunk of ambergris , which netted them $ 295,000 ( £ 155,000 ) .			1

@entity5 found yellow - grey rock while on the beach with his dog @entity24
he thought 3kg lump was the sought - after ambergris from sperm whales
but @entity16 expert said the rock , found in @entity11 , @entity12 , is not ambergris
a dealer in @entity161 is sending mr @entity5 , 52 , a 2g piece as a gesture
