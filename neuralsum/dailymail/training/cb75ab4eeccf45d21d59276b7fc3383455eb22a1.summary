@entity0 is coming to @entity1 , according to an interview the player has given to @entity4 in @entity5			1
in news that will put half of the @entity8 on alert			0
the full back is quoted as saying he will be playing in the @entity8 next season after walking away from @entity13 after seven glorious years			1
sources close to the player told @entity16 on wednesday night that the player was simply expressing an interest in @entity1 and stressed that the interview was given at the end of last season			1
the interview was with @entity5 food critic @entity22 and almost all of its content relates to a project @entity0 has to create a chain of restaurants but when the conversation moves to his future on the pitch he says : ' this will be my last season at @entity13			1
next year i will move to @entity1			0
i want to play in the birthplace of football			2
' @entity0 ( left ) has enjoyed a remarkably successful seven years at @entity13 , pictured with @entity34 in training this week , @entity0 ( right ) runs with @entity36 at the @entity38 stadium in @entity39 no club is mentioned in the the @entity4 exclusive but the news is likely to increase interest from a host of clubs keen on the defender who arrived at @entity13 in 2008 and has since won every honour possible including two champions @entity48 and four @entity51 titles			1
@entity53 ' contract runs out at the end of this season when he will be 32			0
@entity13 have already made plans to replace him buying @entity61 full - back @entity59 in the summer			1
but the new man 's recent debut against @entity64 gave an early indication of just how much @entity0 will be missed			0
alves did n't have his best night against @entity67 on tuesday but he has played a part in @entity13 going five games without conceding in the league and he was at his assist - giving best in the weekend thrashing of @entity72 crossing for @entity34 to score			0
@entity0 ( left ) with @entity73 during @entity13 's @entity75 match with @entity67 on tuesday @entity13 manager @entity76 ( right ) has contingency plans in place should @entity53 leave the @entity79 the two have combined brilliantly throughout the last seven years and the @entity81 will miss him			1
what remains to be seen is which @entity8 coach is prepared to take a gamble on the world 's most attacking full - back			1
here are his options : @entity88 : loves an attacking full - back although he still has @entity90 in that position and with a contract until 2017			2
@entity93 : there is as much chance of @entity0 fitting into one of @entity93 's finally - tuned defences as there is @entity93 donning one of @entity0 's red - trouser and denim - waistcoat post-match outfits for his next @entity8 press conference			2
@entity103 : difficult to see @entity103 making the move although with @entity105 injured he could do with @entity0 now			0
@entity106 : loves an attacking full - back – with @entity108 on one side and @entity0 on the other @entity110 would be some force going forward … and a disaster defensively			1
@entity113 : @entity114 have a right - back shortage			2
@entity53 could even help realize @entity113 ' long - term aim of playing 3 - 4 - 3			0
@entity117 : with @entity118 out @entity119 are another who could do with @entity0 now			0
and you can see him preferring a move to @entity122 if he does switch to @entity1			0
