she has described her comeback single as a satirical swipe at sexism in pop music			1
but @entity5 yesterday found herself accused of being a racist after using scantily clad black women in the music video for the track			1
the single , @entity10 , will be released on sunday but the video was put out this week and within hours led hundreds of fans to question the singer ’s decision to use the troupe of dancers			1
she has said that this is her response to recent music videos , such as those by @entity31 , which can be seen to portray women as sexual objects			1
as miss @entity5 sings , the troupe of dancers perform			2
the majority are black and they are seen twerking , a lewd and particularly provocative hip thrusting dance			2
controversially , the black women are barely covered but the two white women in the video are wearing gold jackets over their skimpy outfits to protect their modesty			1
one fan wrote on @entity47 : ‘ @entity5 is actually disgusting			0
white female pop stars ca n’t make a point about sexism without putting down black people , can they ? ’ another said : ‘ oh , god , @entity5 , gross			0
that is racist and disgusting			0
you do n’t get to “ satirize ” from place of privilege ! ’ twerk it : the mum - of - two dances with women in skimpy outfits while wearing sky scraper heels controversially , the black women are barely covered but the two white women in the video are wearing gold jackets over their skimpy outfits to protect their modesty debate : yesterday a discussion on @entity67 on @entity68 appeared to echo the distress of fans , as race and feminist campaigners voiced their concern about the video ¿ s content yesterday a discussion on @entity77 on @entity68 appeared to echo the distress of fans , as race and feminist campaigners voiced their concern about the video ’s content			1
they argued that miss @entity5 presents her black backing dancers as ‘ nothing more than jiggling ’ material			0
@entity88 , a blogger and black feminist , told programme host dame @entity90 she felt ‘ troubled ’ by the racial message of the video and criticised the ‘ denigrating images of black people ’ that contribute towards ‘ structural racism ’			1
she added : ‘ i first cut my teeth when i was getting involved in feminism with this issue			0
' i was a teenager who absolutely loved this music but felt conflicted that my favourite artists deemed me as a person with a black bum , a woman with a black bum , as nothing more than jiggling material			1
‘ [ @entity110 ] was a black thing			0
that was an issue of black patriarchy , do n’t get me wrong			0
@entity5 is seen dancing with women in her video who twerk and pour champagne over each other not so @entity118 : @entity5 's new video pokes fun at @entity118 's summer hit blurred lines women in @entity5 's video wear skimpy outfits and light up electronic cigarettes beside a flashy car one fan wrote on @entity47 : ¿ @entity5 is actually disgusting			1
white female pop stars can ¿ t make a point about sexism without putting down black people , can they ? ¿ ' but now that it ’s become mainstreamed it ’s about black women ’s bodies served up for a very white male gaze and it ’s about mockery			1
and i just ca n’t see how these two things can marry harmoniously			0
’ in an online defence of her video , miss @entity5 said she was attempting to parody such singers , and added that she would be ‘ deeply saddened if anyone came away from that video feeling taken advantage of or compromised in any way ’			2
commenting on sexism in pop in an interview earlier this week , she said : ‘ i think objectification of women is fine if i feel there is a sense of ownership from the woman			2
' if it comes from somewhere else and it feels like the woman is being coerced or forced into something , then it ’s gross			0
’ last night , however , a media campaigner said that while miss @entity5 meant well , she had perhaps given the wrong message with her video			2
@entity161 , of pressure group @entity162 , said : ‘ i ’m sure she did n’t mean to be racist and she probably intended the women dancing behind her to act as a message that she does n’t need to behave like that			2
and i applaud her efforts			0
' but unfortunately singers really ca n’t afford to be complacent and they must recognise what a serious issue this is			0
’ it is not the first time an artist has got into trouble for using ‘ twerking ’ dancers in their music videos			1
@entity118 faced a backlash over the scantily clad hip - trusting women that feature in his @entity184 video earlier this year			1
and former @entity186 child star @entity185 , 20 , prompted outrage when she performed with @entity118 at an awards ceremony in august , doing similar moves while dressed in a nude - coloured leotard and making lewd gestures with an oversized foam finger .			0

the single @entity10 is released on sunday but the video is already causing controversy
she has said it is in response to recent music videos portraying women as sex objects
