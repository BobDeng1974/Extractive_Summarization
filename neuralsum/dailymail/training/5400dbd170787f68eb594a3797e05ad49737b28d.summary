@entity0 has promised @entity1 that she will take her out to dinner to celebrate passing her career total of 18 @entity5 wins			1
and she also believes she will witness @entity1 overtake @entity7 ’s all - time mark of 22 majors			1
‘ i ’m so happy she won 19 , she deserves it and i think she will reach @entity7 ’s record of 22 , ’ said @entity0 in the wake of the 33 - year - old ’s @entity11 final win over @entity13			1
i think this will fire her up for the @entity27			0
’ @entity1 has ‘ only ’ won @entity27 twice , and given her age it is essential that she keeps on winning if she is to catch the great @entity30			2
some are of the view that she has already proved herself the better player because @entity7 ’s total was inflated by the tragic events in @entity36 in 1993 when @entity37 was stabbed by a deranged fan			2
@entity0 is among those who would assert that @entity37 was the better player at the time but the fact is we will never know what might have been without that gruesome intervention			2
for now @entity1 is heading straight back on to the treadmill as she said after her victory on saturday that she will be fulfilling her commitment to fly to @entity48 where she is due to represent the @entity49 in the @entity50			0
@entity7 pictured winning her 18th @entity5 title with victory against @entity37 ( left ) in 1995 the top players are making sure they are available for the team competition as it is a requirement to qualify for the @entity56 next year			1
you would expect @entity1 to pace herself more and try to peak for the @entity5 this year , as she seeks to return to the form of 2013 , when she won two of them			1
her cause will be aided by the new three - week gap this year that comes between @entity27 and @entity63			0
@entity65 ’s @entity64 , the 15 - year - old originally from @entity67 who now lives in @entity69 , struggled with a leg injury during the @entity11 girls ’ final and was beaten 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 by @entity73 ’s @entity72			0
@entity75 ’s @entity74 , just turned 20 , followed up the achievement of qualifying for the @entity11 by winning the @entity78 event in @entity79			0
he defeated @entity81 ’s @entity80 6 - 1 , 6 - 2 to win his first tournament at that level and is now likely to enter the world ’s top 150 for the first time .			0

@entity0 believes @entity1 will eventually *leapfrog* @entity7
@entity1 won her 19th @entity5 with recent @entity11 win
@entity0 will take @entity1 out for dinner after she passed her career total
