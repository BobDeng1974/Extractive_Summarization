by @entity0 saturday was the first time in a long time that i have seen an @entity5 team play attractive football			1
i really enjoyed their performance , despite the result			2
they played with real flair , particularly @entity12			0
but if @entity5 are to make a real mark on this tournament , either @entity15 or @entity16 needs to start thursday ’s match against @entity18 on the bench			1
yes , it is a tough decision for @entity21 to leave one of them out but they both play the same position			1
there would also then be the advantage of bringing one of them off the bench to change the game			2
one or the other : @entity16 or @entity15 must be dropped to the bench against @entity18 you need to keep back one of your ‘ firework ’ players for when the opposition are tiring — @entity37 did it well with @entity39 against @entity40			1
it ’s a bigger sacrifice to put @entity15 out on the left than on the bench			1
unlike a lot of people , i thought @entity15 played well against @entity47 so it is a tough choice between him and @entity16 , who is in such good form			1
i would also like to see @entity5 give @entity51 more support			1
he was having to defend , create and attack on saturday , which is too much for one person to do			0
if @entity5 support him more , he will have more energy , which is vital as when his energy dropped after an hour against @entity47 , @entity5 faded			1
give him more support : @entity51 was having to defend , create and attack against @entity47 @entity60 fans can sometimes be a bit harsh on their team so i hope there is a real positive energy created around the team			1
it has been a long season and , although it sounds simple , loud support from the fans does give players extra power			2
@entity70 is an entertainment business and the players would be nowhere without the fans			0
at tournaments like this , they need them more than ever			0
my country @entity77 made a cracking start and gave @entity79 a real wake - up call with the 5 - 1 thrashing on friday night			1
bizarrely , i think the tournament will become harder for @entity84 ’s team as their opponents will be taking them even more seriously			1
the alarm bells will be ringing			0
you do n’t need me to tell you what a great coach @entity88 is — his c.v does that			0
but what sets him apart is his ability to get his message across to his players and get them working really well as a team			0
the boss : @entity84 ( right ) high fives @entity99 and his ability to get the best out of his players sets him apart from other coaches he is an very explosive man but most great coaches are and he has the tactical and technical ability to get away with it			2
he is also highly motivated after failing to qualify for the @entity107 during his first spell as head coach			0
i would n’t put @entity77 up there with @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity37 as the favourites for the tournament but they are not too behind after that performance			1
world champions @entity79 need to respond against @entity117 — it will be a huge test			0
@entity111 impressed me but they did n’t surprise me			0
@entity112 and @entity37 looked like they were feeling the pressure but two teams that really impressed me were @entity123 and @entity124			1
@entity123 are much more organised than the other @entity126 teams and they have such quality			2
once they used that quality to turn the game around against @entity132 , they did n’t let their opponents have a single effort on goal and it was that that impressed me most			0
they were in control and are now a mature side who will do well			0
passion : @entity142 could not quite believe it after scoring the @entity124 's winner against @entity145 @entity124 have the great combination of @entity148 ’s discipline and their natural national passion			1
they were so organised against @entity145 and are a real threat to @entity154 ’s @entity153			1
i would n’t be surprised to see them qualify			0
finally , i want to congratulate @entity112 on the tournament so far			2
despite all the concerns before it started , everything is going great			0
they atmosphere is very special — @entity112 are picking a team to support for the game they ’re watching and making lots of noise			2
here in @entity168 , there is a lot of fun , a lot of music and a lot of joy — i have n’t seen even the slightest hint of danger			0
i ’m having a lot of fun , especially in the @entity179 studio			0
full of fun : two @entity112 pose at the @entity182 - @entity181 match and the @entity107 atmosphere is special			2

@entity15 or @entity16 must be an ' firework ' player coming off the bench
it would be a tough decision for @entity21 but needs to be made
@entity5 need to give @entity51 more support
teams will now be *gunning* for @entity84 's @entity77
@entity154 and @entity153 must *beware* the @entity124
congratulations @entity112 - the tournament has been *brilliant* so far
