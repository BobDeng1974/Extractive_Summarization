humans mastered the art of catching fast - moving , deep - water fish such as tuna more than 40,000 years ago , archaeologists revealed today			1
a team of @entity7 experts have uncovered evidence of the practice in a small cave at the eastern end of @entity12 , north of @entity7 , which contained the bones of more than 2,800 fish			1
some were caught as long as 42,000 years ago			0
exciting find : fish bones and hooks at the excavation site in an @entity12 cave , which showed prehistoric humans were adept at catching fish in deep water they also found the world 's earliest recorded fish hook , made of shell and dating from between 23,000 and 16,000 years ago , during excavations at the @entity31 cave site			1
the findings , published in the latest issue of the journal @entity35 , stem from work done by professor @entity37 from the college of @entity39 and the @entity40 at the @entity41			0
she said it demonstrated prehistoric man had high - level maritime skills , and by implication , the technology needed to make the ocean crossings to reach @entity7			2
she said : ' the site that we studied featured more than 38,000 fish bones from 2,843 individual fish dating back 42,000 years			2
' what the site in @entity12 has shown us is that early modern humans in @entity39 had amazingly advanced maritime skills			1
' they were expert at catching the types of fish that would be challenging even today - fish like tuna			1
it 's a very exciting find			2
' @entity63 : our ancestors developed techniques to catch fast - moving fish like tuna ( pictured ) far earlier than previously thought a fish hook was also found at the site , but @entity37 said was not likely to have been used for deep - sea fishing			1
' this is , we believe , the earliest - known example of a fish hook and shows that our ancestors were skilled craftspeople as well as fishers , ' she said			1
' the hooks do n't seem suitable for pelagic fishing , but it is possible that other types of hooks were being made at the same time			0
' what is still unknown is exactly how these ancient people were able to catch fast - moving deep - ocean fish			1
@entity85 business : tuna can be caught using nets or by trawling hooks on long lines through the sea			2
but this can be tricky even by today 's standards tuna can be caught using nets or by trolling hooks on long lines through the water , said @entity37			1
' simple fish aggregating devices such as tethered logs can also be used to attract them			0
so they may have been caught using hooks or nets , ' she said			0
' either way it seems certain that these people were using quite sophisticated technology and watercraft to fish offshore			0
' she added that the finds may shed light on how @entity7 's first inhabitants arrived on the continent , with the implication that seaworthy boats would have been used to fish in the deep ocean			2
' we have known for a long time that @entity7 's ancient ancestors must have been able to travel hundreds of kilometres by sea because they reached @entity7 by at least 50,000 years ago , ' said @entity37			0
' when we look at the watercraft that indigenous @entity7 used at the time of @entity123 contact , however , they are all very simple , like rafts and canoes			0
' so how people got here at such an early date has always been puzzling			0
these new finds from @entity31 cave go a long way to solving the puzzle			0

*remains* of more than 2,800 fish *unearthed* in @entity12 cave
show humans were catching fast - moving fish like tuna far earlier than previously thought
archaeologists also uncover world 's oldest fish hook
