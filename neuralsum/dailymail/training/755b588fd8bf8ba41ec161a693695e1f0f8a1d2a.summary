supporters also helped spread the word by plastering donated flyers throughout the city on several utility poles , traffic light poles , bus stops and city owned garbage cans			2
this , however , proved to be too much for city officials - @entity55 has a specific ordinance that prohibits people from posting signs on public property , including telephone poles and bus stops			1
it 's overwhelming , ' public works director @entity63 told the @entity65			0
' there must be hundreds			0
public infrastructure is not the venue to display that			0
' ' i sympathize , but after the dogs are found , do people take them down ? ' @entity63 said			2
' they become blight and litter			0
' social media : a social media campaign raised enough money for @entity21 to buy a billboard on a busy freeway on tuesday , environmental services manager @entity82 informed @entity21 that she had two weeks to remove the signs			1
' i tried to be as sympathetic as i could ; my wife and i were dog owners , ' @entity82 told the paper			0
he says that as sympathetic as he is to the cause , ' we 've been real consistent with how we 've addressed these [ types of ] signs			0
' the town could potentially fine @entity94 if the signs are n't removed , but @entity82 says ' we 're not looking to be punitive			0

he added that the town has been very lenient about the signs , but that when there are complaints , the city needs to act			2
anyone with info about the two pooches is asked to contact @entity94 or authorities in @entity55 ' i get it			2
a corner becomes a great place to get your point across , ' he said			0
but ' where do you draw the line between a person looking for their dog and a business advertising gutter cleaning ? ' @entity21 says she 's not happy that the city is forcing her to tone down her search , but says she understands that officials are only doing their jobs			2
all @entity21 cares about is getting her dogs back , but she 's asked supporters to no longer post signs on public property , and that she would try to have the ones already posted removed			1
@entity21 says the $ 5,000 reward for the dogs wo n't get any higher , but wants anyone with information to call her - no questions asked , according to the paper			1
