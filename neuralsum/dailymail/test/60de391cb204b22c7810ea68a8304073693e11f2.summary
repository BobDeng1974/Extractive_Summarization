when it comes to @entity2 stereotypes suggest that men are more adept than women			0
but new research has revealed that females may actually be better at mastering the use of tools - at least among chimpanzees			2
researchers have found that female chimps are more likely to use the tools to help them hunt for food while males tend to prefer capturing prey with their hands			1
this female chimp has stripped a stick of leaves and uses it to flush out a bush baby from a hollow tree trunk while the findings may provoke some to reassess their view of the opposite sex , the research may also provide tantalising hints at how humans first learned to use weapons to hunt			1
it suggests that early female humans were perhaps the first to begin fashioning simple tools to help them catch prey			1
it has been known that chimpanzees use tools like humans for more than 50 years			2
in 1960 , @entity47 witnessed two chimps using twigs to fish for termites in the ground			0
this was the first time that an animal was observed to make a tool and use it for a specific purpose , other than humans			2
it was later found that the @entity59 chimps use twigs , leaves and rocks in nine different ways to feed , drink , clean themselves , reach other objects and to fashion weapons			0
in communities outside @entity59 , communities make different tools			0
chimpanzees make sponges by chewing leaves and dipping them into puddles of water so they can use them as drinking vessels			0
they have been observed using sticks and rocks to smash fruit and shells			0
adult males sometimes hurl rocks and sticks like make - shift spears to intimidate rivals			0
this study said that chimps use shoots from @entity91 to hunt aggressive army ants in a specific way			0
it is thought that the behaviour is passed from one generation to the next and is learned by young chimpanzees			0
writing in the journal @entity99 , dr @entity100 , a primatologist at @entity19 said : ' @entity103 - dwelling chimpanzees at @entity22 , @entity23 , are the only non-human population known to systematically hunt vertebrate prey with tools			1
' acquiring vertebrate prey via tool use at @entity22 supports the hypothesis that early hominins intensified their tool technology to overcome environmental pressures and that even the earliest hominins were probably sophisticated enough to fashion tools for hunting			1
' the behaviour of these chimpanzees demonstrates that hunting is less adult male - biased among our closest living relatives than previously believed when tools are used			1
' if tool use enabled early hominins to reduce the need for physical characteristics ( i.e. greater size , strength ) to achieve hunting efficiency , such sexual dimorphism ultimately becomes less important regarding prey acquisition			1
' scientists first reported chimps using spear - like sticks to hunt prey at @entity22 in @entity23 in 2007 , and it was later filmed by the @entity135 in their hugely successful natural history series @entity137			1
over the following years dr @entity100 and her team have recorded 308 hunts using tools			2
tools tended to be used when the chimps were hunting bush babies , called @entity145			1
when dr @entity100 and her colleagues analysed the hunts they had recorded , however , they found that more of them tended to be carried out by female chimps			1
the findings were surprising as most hunting behaviour is conducted by males and overall they account for 70 per cent of all prey captured			2
the chimps at @entity22 in @entity23 ( shown above ) are the only animals to regularly hunt for prey with tools			1
scientists first reported chimps using spear - like sticks to hunt prey at @entity22 in @entity23 in 2007 , and it was later filmed by the @entity135 in their hugely successful natural history series @entity137 researchers observed more female chimps using broken sticks like above to help them capture prey			1
however , the male chimpanzees tended to capture larger prey and used their hands however , the male chimpanzees tended to capture larger prey and used their hands			1
females carried out 61 per cent of the hunts using tools			2
they found that even in hunts involving tools , male chimps would often capture prey driven into their hands by those wielding tools			1
dr @entity100 added : ' what would often happen is the male would be in the vicinity of another chimp hunting with a tool , often a female , and the bush baby was able to escape the female and the male grabbed the bush baby as it fled			2
' she added : ' it 's just another example of diversity in chimp behavior that we keep finding the longer we study wild chimps			0
' other groups of chimpanzees have been seen to use tools in other ways to help them gather hard to reach food - such as using sticks to ' fish ' for termites			0
again these activities tend to be dominated by females , but dr @entity100 said it could not be easily compared to the hunting behaviour seen at @entity22			1
she said : ' fishing for termites is a very different activity than jabbing for a bush baby			0
' tool use by chimpanzees is now considered to be fairly widespread with many groups having been observed using stones or sticks to crack open nuts , fish for termites and in some cases to capture small mammals ' with fishing , termites grab on to a twig and do n't let go and the chimp eats the termites off the twig			0
' when hunting , the bush baby tries to bite , escape or hide from the chimp			0
the chimps are really averse to being bitten by a bush baby			0
' instead she believes there is something very specific about the open @entity103 environment compared to forests that has driven the chimps living at @entity22 to use tools in this way			1
she said that hunting bush babies with tools may be a way of allowing them to get access to a highly nutritious food source without having to chase down their prey			2
something similar may have happened with early humans as their environment changed to become more @entity103 like			0
writing in the journal , the researchers said : ' the @entity103 environment might be viewed as the catalyst for tool - assisted hunting by @entity103 chimpanzees in @entity23 in that apes here exploit prey that is largely ignored by forest - dwelling chimpanzees			1
' @entity261 ' preferred prey at other sites , the red colobus monkey ( @entity264 ) is absent in the dry , open savannah - woodland at @entity22			2
' @entity145 hunting at @entity22 represents a high - energy , low - risk resource that members of various age – sex classes can take advantage of , similar to what is observed among tool - equipped human hunters			1
' additionally , typical adult male chimpanzee arboreal hunting behaviour was unlikely to be characteristic of early bipedal hominins given the latter 's anatomical differences with living apes			0
' with such anatomical changes in our lineage , tool use probably became increasingly important to hunting behaviour			0

researchers recorded chimps hunting with tools at @entity22 in @entity23
tool use was *spotted* on 300 *occasions* and 60 *%* was by females
male chimps did more hunting but tended to capture prey with their hands
the findings may provide clues as to how humans first learned to use tools
