' you obviously do n’t need to eat twice as much - do n’t eat for two ! - around 300 extra calories is fine , but you need quality protein , which is hard to get on a vegan diet			1
' as a vegan ( pregnant or not ) , you must really know your stuff			2
' it 's important to combine proteins to get all of the amino acids			0
you also need vitamins , including @entity186 , which you can only get from animal sources ; without good quality @entity186 you may have a baby with poor immunity			2
' there are no vegan sources of @entity186 , so they would need supplementation			2
' then there ’s essential fatty acids such as omega 3 , which is found in animal sources ( or masses of seaweed )			0
' on the plus side , vegans have a lot of green leafy vegetables , which are packed with iron , folic acid and calcium , which are all great during pregnancy			2
' on top of her healthy diet , she endured hours of running , cycling and lifting weights as dr phd @entity214 ( www.marilynglenville.com ) explains : ' eating healthily means eating regular meals of freshly prepared whole foods			1
buy organically grown produce wherever possible as this reduces the toxic load on the body			0
eat a good proportion of raw fruits and vegetables			2
do not eat raw meat or raw fish			2
steam rather than boil , stir fry rather than deep fry and grill or stew rather than roast or fry			0
make sure your diet is balanced with adequate protein , complex carbohydrates and high in essential fats but low in saturated fats and drink plenty of filtered or mineral water			2
' foods to include @entity242 sources : fresh fruit and vegetables ( raw or lightly cooked ) , wholegrain breads , brown rice , wild rice , millet , oats , barley , buckwheat , rye and @entity253			2
protein good sources : organic poultry ( 1 or 2 pieces per week ) , fish , goat milk , sheep milk , organic eggs , vegetarian cheese , nuts , soya , seeds and pulses			0
some grains are better sources than others , for example @entity253 and millet ; the rest have a small amount and should be combined with other protein sources			0
fats good sources : oily fish such as wild organic salmon , sardines , mackerel and herring			0
pumpkin seeds , sunflower seeds , walnuts , almonds , evening primrose oil , olive oil , hemp oil , starflower / borage oil and flax seed oil			0
water : many of us do not drink enough water			0
it is thought to be essential in providing the medium in which many chemical reactions within the body take place			0
sadly much of our tap water does not measure up to safety standards required			0
it is advisable to drink only bottled or filtered water whilst pregnant			0
fibre good sources : @entity306 grains , fruit and vegetables , nuts and seeds			0
you can also soak a tablespoon of whole linseeds in a glass of water overnight and swallow with an extra glass of water to help with the bowel .			0
