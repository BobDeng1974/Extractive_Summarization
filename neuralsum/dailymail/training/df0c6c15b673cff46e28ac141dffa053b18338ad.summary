by @entity0 @entity1 announced today that it will eliminate up to 18,000 jobs over the next year as it works on integrating the @entity4 devices business it bought in april			1
with the @entity4 deal , @entity1 's employee headcount rose from about 99,000 last year to 127,000 as of last month			1
@entity1 said on thursday that of the up to 18,000 jobs , about 12,500 professional and factory jobs will be cut			1
@entity1 's stock rose slightly on thursday and was currently at $ 45.44 after jumping 3 per cent			1
the deepest job cuts in the company 's 39 - year history come five months into the tenure of ceo @entity23 , who outlined plans for a ' leaner ' business in a public memo to employees last week			1
about 12,500 of the layoffs will come from eliminating overlaps with the @entity4 unit , which @entity1 acquired in april for $ 7.2 billion			1
@entity1 did not say how many jobs would come from @entity4 and how many from existing operations			1
the acquisition of @entity4 's handset business in april added 25,000 people to @entity1 , pushing its overall headcount up to 127,000			1
the @entity4 - related cuts were widely expected			1
@entity1 said when it struck the deal that it would cut $ 600 million per year in costs within 18 months of closing the acquisition			1
@entity1 did not detail exactly where the remaining jobs would be cut , but said the first wave of layoffs would affect 1,351 jobs in the @entity46 area			1
@entity23 , ceo of @entity1 ( pictured in may )			1
he outlined plans for a ' leaner ' business in a public memo to employees last week the company said it expects to take pretax charges of $ 1.1 billion to $ 1.6 billion over the next four quarters to account for the costs of the layoffs			1
@entity23 's cuts are the biggest at the @entity59 , @entity60 - based company since predecessor @entity61 axed 5,800 , or about 6 percent of headcount , in the depths of the recession in early 2009			1
the new ceo 's moves are designed to help @entity1 shift from being a primarily software - focused company to one that sells online services , apps and devices it hopes will make people and businesses more productive			1
@entity23 needs to make @entity1 a stronger competitor to @entity74 and @entity75 , which have dominated the new era of mobile - centric computing			1
@entity1 stock has climbed more or less steadily from the beginning of the year and took a jump after the @entity4 acquisition in april marking this change of emphasis , @entity23 last week rebranded @entity1 as ' the productivity and platform company for the mobile - first and cloud - first world '			1
@entity1 is not alone among the pioneers of the personal computer revolution now slimming down to adapt to the @entity91 - focused world			2
pc - maker @entity92 is in the midst of a radical three - to - five - year plan that will lop up to 50,000 from its staff of 250,000			1
@entity96 is undergoing a ' workforce rebalancing ' , which analysts say could mean 13,000 , or about 3 percent of its staff , being laid off or transferred to new owners as units are sold			2
chipmaker @entity104 and network equipment maker @entity103 both said in the past year they were cutting about 5 percent of their staffs			0
@entity1 announced on thursday that it will cut up to 18,000 jobs , or about 14 per cent of its staff			1
ceo @entity23 , who took the job in february , delivered the news to staff in a memo that @entity1 released publicly			1
here 's the text of that memo : from : @entity114 : all @entity115 : july 17 , 2014 at 5:00 a.m. @entity116 : starting to @entity118 and @entity119 week in my email to you i synthesized our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company			2
having a clear focus is the start of the journey , not the end			0
the more difficult steps are creating the organization and culture to bring our ambitions to life			0
today i 'll share more on how we 're moving forward			0
on july 22 , during our public earnings call , i 'll share further specifics on where we are focusing our innovation investments			0
the first step to building the right organization for our ambitions is to realign our workforce			0
with this in mind , we will begin to reduce the size of our overall workforce by up to 18,000 jobs in the next year			2
of that total , our work toward synergies and strategic alignment on @entity150 is expected to account for about 12,500 jobs , comprising both professional and factory workers			2
we are moving now to start reducing the first 13,000 positions , and the vast majority of employees whose jobs will be eliminated will be notified over the next six months			2
it 's important to note that while we are eliminating roles in some areas , we are adding roles in certain other strategic areas			2
my promise to you is that we will go through this process in the most thoughtful and transparent way possible			0
we will offer severance to all employees impacted by these changes , as well as job transition help in many locations , and everyone can expect to be treated with the respect they deserve for their contributions to this company			2
later today your senior leadership team member will share more on what to expect in your organization			0
our workforce reductions are mainly driven by two outcomes : work simplification as well as @entity150 integration synergies and strategic alignment			0
first , we will simplify the way we work to drive greater accountability , become more agile and move faster			0
as part of modernizing our engineering processes the expectations we have from each of our disciplines will change			0
in addition , we plan to have fewer layers of management , both top down and sideways , to accelerate the flow of information and decision making			0
this includes flattening organizations and increasing the span of control of people managers			0
in addition , our business processes and support models will be more lean and efficient with greater trust between teams			0
the overall result of these changes will be more productive , impactful teams across @entity1			2
these changes will affect both the @entity1 workforce and our vendor staff			2
each organization is starting at different points and moving at different paces			0
second , we are working to integrate the @entity150 teams into @entity1			2
we will realize the synergies to which we committed when we announced the acquisition last september			0
the first - party phone portfolio will align to @entity1 's strategic direction			1
to win in the higher price tiers , we will focus on breakthrough innovation that expresses and enlivens @entity1 's digital work and digital life experiences			1
in addition , we plan to shift select @entity231 product designs to become @entity233 products running @entity234			0
this builds on our success in the affordable smartphone space and aligns with our focus on @entity239			0
making these decisions to change are difficult , but necessary			0
i want to invite you to my monthly q&a event tomorrow			0
i hope you can join , and i hope you will ask any question that 's on your mind			0
thank you for your support as we start to take steps forward in evolving our organization and @entity250			0
