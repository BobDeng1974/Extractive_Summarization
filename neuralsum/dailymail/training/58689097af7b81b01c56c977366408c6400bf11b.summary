@entity0 insists @entity1 have to be ready to put their bodies on the line against the @entity4 at @entity5 on saturday , but warns muscle alone will not be enough to underpin a first victory of the autumn			1
the @entity4 have been described as ' the big green machine ' by @entity1 attacking coach @entity10 , while prop @entity11 assessed the challenge awaiting in the second @entity13 by stating ' their @entity14 is run hard and if that does n't work then run harder '			1
' we know @entity4 are a big , physical team who like to use route one , so we have to use our smarts to move them around and create mismatches , ' the @entity17 8 said			1
@entity0 throws a pass at @entity1 training as @entity27 's side prepare for @entity4 the no 8 says @entity1 are ready to take on the @entity4 ' massive forward pack ' we want to get @entity4 running around the field chasing us			1
if we can do that and take our opportunities , we 'll come out on top			2
' if we carry into narrow channels then that 's exactly what they 'll want			2
they 'll line us up from 10 metres away and come charging at us			2
but if we can shift the point of attack , it can make the world of difference			2
' not only does it give you the one - on - one carries that everyone wants , but it means the defence is always moving around			2
if you hit them tight then they do n't really move			0
' but you ca n't get away from the fact you have to carry hard too			0
you wo n't always be able to put those passes in , you have to front up and go through the line			0
' taking big hits takes it out of you , but we 're advanced enough as a team to move around and cope with that sort of stuff			2
' there are quite a few @entity62 matches that have ended in a slogging match , so we 've gone all though that type of game			0
we know what we 're up against this weekend			0
' @entity0 's first exposure to the @entity4 was the 2012 summer tour when @entity1 were swept aside in the first two tests before recovering to earn a 14 - 14 draw in @entity72			1
@entity27 puts @entity1 through their paces as he looks to open their @entity75 account @entity4 ' veteran @entity76 prepares as his side look to bounce back from defeat by @entity79 the 25 - year - old has now amassed 24 caps and he can see the progress made since the first trip abroad of @entity27 's reign			1
' for many of us that was our first tour and it was a real learning curve			0
i was very green back then and i 've come a long way since , ' @entity0 said			1
' i 'm a lot more experienced and have learnt a lot of lessons through winning and losing			0
there were also the experience of going through that difficult patch with @entity17 last year			0
' i 'm definitely more rounded and i know what i have to do now			0
i 'm better defensively , which has changed with experience			0
' @entity0 is likely to continue in his role as no 8 reinforcement to @entity102 when @entity104 names his starting xv on thursday morning			1
@entity102 faded in the 24 - 21 defeat by @entity106 , but , while there are concerns over his fitness at international level , the 22 - year - old looks set to profit from @entity104 's desire to give the same 23 another chance			1
@entity1 stretch out in training after their 24 - 21 loss to @entity106 on saturday @entity102 looks set to start again at @entity116 , with @entity0 to come off the bench with fresh legs ' obviously i want to start every game			1
i do n't want to be a bench player , but @entity102 's been playing well and if i can make an impact coming off the bench then i want to do that , ' @entity0 said			1
' if you start you walk on to the pitch with the intention of playing the 80 minutes , but that does n't mean you leave anything in the tank			0
basically you go out there and empty the tank			0
' with the likes of myself and @entity102 , it 's good to know someone else can step off the bench and give as much as they can			2
' @entity136 has been ruled out with a thigh problem , so @entity138 has been drafted into the squad as wing cover and is competing with @entity141 to start in the number 14 jersey			0
an injury doubt hangs over flanker @entity144 , who @entity1 say is suffering from general soreness after the @entity106 game , so @entity147 is on standby as his replacement .			1
