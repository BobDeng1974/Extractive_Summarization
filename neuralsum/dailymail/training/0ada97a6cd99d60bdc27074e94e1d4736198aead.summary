the @entity7 want @entity4 to give a lesser punishment to players caught taking non-performance - enhancing drugs than those who cheat			1
the union , which represents more than 15,000 people including some of the biggest names in football , golf , rugby and cricket , says a proposed two - year ban is ' draconian '			1
the @entity7 has launched a legal bid to ensure @entity4 bans athletes caught taking performance - enhancing drugs for longer than those who are found to have taken recreational drugs it has today launched legal action in a @entity26 court - the only judicial body to that has the power to review @entity4 decisions - to try to overturn the proposal			1
the union is challenging moves by @entity4 to punish offenders in the same way for a positive test , irrespective of whether they had used performance - enhancing or recreational drugs the @entity7 said the focus should be on trying to help sports stars who take drugs like cocaine and cannabis			1
@entity44 , general secretary of the @entity7 , said : ' @entity4 â€™s treatment of recreational drugs is still stuck in the twentieth century			1
' it is depressing that a group who refuse to even recognise the term " recreational drugs " is now seeking to undermine the good work that is being developed on mental wellbeing and rehabilitation for sportsmen and women with addiction problems			2
' recreation drug abuse has no place in professional sport but it would be naive in the extreme to think that it does not exist			0

the clause recognised that recreational drug abuse was wrong but was different from performance enhancing drugs so should have a lower tariff with a focus on rehabilitation as well as bans			2
