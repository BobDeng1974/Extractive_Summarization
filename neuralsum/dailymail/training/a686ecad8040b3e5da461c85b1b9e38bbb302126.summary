agony : dr @entity1 suffers from an enzyme deficiency that ca n't metabolise the painkiller codeine to break it down into morphine dr @entity1 suffered tremendous pain while recovering from surgery for skin cancer			1
‘ i was given lots of codeine - based medicines but they seemed to do nothing for me , ’ recalls @entity1 , 60 , a biotech entrepreneur			1
he followed his doctors ’ instructions carefully , believing that if he took the painkillers for long enough they would start working			2
‘ the pain was particularly intense in my neck where i ’d had lymph nodes removed — i assumed it was because they ’d sliced through nerves			1
it was some of the worst pain i ’d ever experienced and it was constant for many weeks			1
’ but he felt there was little to be done			2
‘ it did n’t occur to me to complain to my doctors as i was on the maximum dose and i just thought it reflected how ill i was , not that the drugs were n’t working			2
‘ at the time i was more concerned with staying alive , as the cancer was quite advanced and had spread to lymph nodes under my arms and in my neck , ’ says @entity1 , who lives in @entity28 , @entity29 , with his wife @entity30 , 60 , and daughter @entity30 , 21			0
several weeks after the surgery @entity1 ’s pain finally disappeared			1
but it was only six years later , while developing new genetic tests as part of his job , that he suddenly realised why the medication had not touched his pain			1
@entity1 , who has a phd in molecular biology , was working with professor @entity46 , an expert in drug metabolism at @entity48 , @entity49 , who had identified differences in the way our bodies respond to drugs			1
professor @entity46 had worked out that these differences may be linked to variations in genes controlling enzyme production			1
enzymes are proteins , made in the liver , which control the speed of chemical reactions in our bodies			0
they help to break down drugs so the body can use them			0
professor @entity46 found that gene variations can affect certain enzymes so that too much or too little of a chemical is produced			0
for example , an enzyme called @entity73 breaks down codeine into morphine to provide pain relief			1
@entity78 , which is given for mild to moderate pain , is a cheap drug for @entity82 to prescribe and is widely used — in 2012 there were nearly 19 million @entity85 prescriptions for painkillers containing codeine , including co-codamol ( codeine and paracetamol ) , the tenth most prescribed drug in the @entity90			1
@entity78 is also an effective cough suppressant , used in many non-prescription cough medicines and cold remedies			0
the problem is that an estimated 7 to 10 per cent of the population have a gene variation which means they do n’t make enough @entity73 to obtain pain relief from codeine			1
up to six million @entity90 may be affected in this way , although most are unaware of it			1
tests confirmed that @entity1 ’s body ca n’t make enough of the enzyme			1
he explains : ‘ if you do n’t make enough @entity73 you can take as much codeine as you like but it wo n’t make a blind bit of difference			1
it ’s as simple as that			0
’ @entity78 is given for mild to moderate pain and is the tenth most prescribed drug in the @entity90 but that is not the only issue with this particular enzyme			1
there is another group of people who produce too much @entity73 , so codeine is broken down too quickly in their bodies			1
this creates a fast ‘ hit ’ which then rapidly wears off , explains dr @entity123 , a gp and pain specialist for the @entity126			1
‘ these so - called rapid metabolisers experience a quick morphine hit when the drug is broken down			1
the effects of the dose then wear off too quickly , so they start clock - watching until their next dose			0
in some rare cases this fast - acting effect has caused respiratory depression ( when breathing stops ) , particularly in children , and even deaths			0
’ this is why children recovering from surgery are now no longer given codeine - based pain relief , and why children ’s cough medicines no longer contain the drug			1
dr @entity123 suggests that there may be even more fast metabolisers than non-metabolisers — and that put together they could amount to about 30 per cent of the population			0
‘ patients often keep taking codeine in the vain hope that it will work eventually — but all they experience are the side - effects , such as constipation ( it slows down gut movement in the intestine ) and none of the pain - relieving benefits , ’ says dr @entity123			1
‘ they might return to their gp for a higher dose and still not get any relief			1
‘ then there are all the people who buy over-the - counter codeine products , who also get no pain relief			1
‘ there could be huge numbers of people on medication that does n’t work for them , or works too quickly to control pain effectively			1
’ yet there are alternatives , including paracetamol , ibuprofen , diclofenac and other anti-inflammatories			0
exercise can help with pain too — particularly for people with arthritis			2
common issue : it is estimated that between seven and ten per cent of the population can not break down codeine @entity78 is not the only drug metabolised by @entity73			1
there are some 25 others including the opioid painkiller tramadol , certain antidepressants known as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors , or @entity197 , which include @entity198 and @entity199 , and antipsychotic drugs used to treat mental illness			0
beta - blockers prescribed for high blood pressure and the breast cancer drug tamoxifen , taken by 13,000 women , also fall into this category			1
dr @entity1 says it ’s a big issue			0
‘ if a woman is taking tamoxifen , as a side - effect she may experience hot flushes , and sometimes @entity197 are prescribed for these			2
certain types of @entity197 are also metabolised by the @entity73 enzyme , so the two drugs compete for the small amount of enzyme in the liver — this could mean that the cancer - suppressing action of tamoxifen does n’t work as there is not enough @entity73 to metabolise the drugs			1
’ @entity227 , of the charity @entity228 , says patients frequently ring its helpline in tears because codeine is not working for them			2
‘ many have simply not been told that it does n’t work for everyone , so they soldier on , believing that if they keep taking it or just up their dose it will work eventually			0
or they stop taking it and do n’t tell their doctor			0
‘ we encourage them to go back to their gp so they can be switched to something else			0
’ dr @entity247 , associate professor of pharmacy at @entity248 and a spokesman for the @entity250 , says pharmacists are usually aware of the @entity73 problem but it is less well known among @entity82			1
‘ we need greater awareness of the condition among patients as well as @entity82 , ’ he says			0
could the answer be to screen people for the genetic variation ? dr @entity123 says more research is needed to investigate how widespread the problem is , but he believes genetic screening could potentially be beneficial			0
‘ it may be money well spent in cases where patients have a pain condition , ’ he says			2
‘ screening could determine how well other drugs work , too			0
it ’s common sense to find out whether a drug is going to work for you at the beginning			2
’ in fact dr @entity1 is developing a gene test for @entity73 using both saliva and blood tests which can give results within 45 minutes — it could cost less than £ 50 and may be available within a year ( currently cyp2d6 tests are only available privately from the @entity283 )			1
however , dr @entity284 , consultant in pain medicine at @entity286 , @entity287 , is less convinced about the benefits of routine screening			2
‘ people are shocked drugs do n’t work for everyone but all drugs are metabolised differently			0
if you gave ten people the same drug you ’d get a different response in each			2
the reasons are not just down to @entity73 , ’ she says			1
‘ if codeine was the only painkiller available , there would be more interest in screening people routinely for this enzyme problem			1
’ indeed as dr @entity247 points out , ‘ even if you do n’t have a problem with production of the @entity73 enzyme , codeine still might not work for you , as drug response in pain is such a complex process ’			1
in the meantime , if codeine is n’t working for you , tell your doctor so he can prescribe another type of painkiller , advises dr @entity123			2
@entity317 @entity318 is the top city in @entity90 for internet orders of erectile dysfunction aids			1
the fewest orders come from @entity323 , according to figures from @entity325			0
men with erectile dysfunction could benefit from soundwave therapy , a treatment developed to zap kidney stones			0
@entity332 researchers are using a less intense form of the treatment on men who have not responded to medication			0
the shockwaves are thought to stimulate the growth of blood vessels , improving blood flow to the area			0
in an earlier study at the @entity345 , 20 men who had suffered impotence for an average of three years experienced a significant increase in the duration of erections after the treatment			0
ten no longer needed drug therapy			2
now , in a larger study , 50 men will have monthly sessions of the treatment over a year			0
knee bracing can reduce symptoms of osteoarthritis , according to a @entity283 study			0
patients reported a 33 per cent improvement in symptoms after using a flexible fabric brace			0
the design helps redistribute the load on the knee , taking pressure off the damaged area			0
however , researchers at the @entity368 at @entity369 , @entity370 , are not clear why it should help so much			0
a trial is looking at which of two gout treatments works best			0
the condition , characterised by swelling and severe pain , is caused by a build - up of uric acid , a waste product made in the body			2
it can form tiny crystals in and around joints that lead to often agonising attacks			0
in a study at @entity388 , 400 volunteers will be given naproxen or colchicine , the main treatments for the condition			0
@entity393 blocks the body ’s production of compounds that cause pain and inflammation			2
colchicine reduces pain and tenderness by preventing white blood cells travelling to affected areas			2
the body reacts to uric acid crystals as if they were invading bacteria and sends white blood cells to tackle them ; this results in inflammation			0
the trial will compare how each drug works and any side - effects .			2

up to six million @entity90 do not produce enzyme @entity73
it breaks down codeine into morphine to provide pain relief
pain killer codeine is the tenth most prescribed drug in the @entity90
