when @entity1 circa 1998 was trying to find his way at @entity3 , he turned to a man by the name of @entity6			1
and that never changed , right up until the @entity9 defender left in 2004			0
' [ @entity6 ] would stand there , in the team line - up , and say to me : " @entity1 , listen to this @entity15 music , this is what you want to hear season after season , " and he was excited , ' @entity1 remembered last april			1
' even now i 've got goose bumps on my legs – i will never forget those nights standing alongside @entity6 in this competition			2
' now @entity1 has gone from student to master with a new pupil in the class of 2015 : @entity27			1
@entity1 and @entity27 acknowledge each other as the two build on their defensive partnership @entity1 ( right ) celebrates with @entity6 back when he was learning from his defensive partner @entity1 learned his trade from @entity32 legend @entity6 after the pair became regular defensive partners @entity27 ( right ) looks to be @entity32 's latest prospect and @entity1 is taking the 20 - year - old under his wing @entity27 and @entity1 hug at full - time after another defensive pairing for @entity32 under @entity40 @entity27 's heat map against @entity42 on saturday evening on saturday at @entity3 , @entity1 's defensive partner was a man 14 years younger than him			1
@entity27 was favoured ahead of @entity44 - the @entity49 international demoted to the substitutes ' bench and fighting for his future - as @entity32 went toe - to - toe with @entity42			1
it was a hell of a call by @entity40 to back a man that had just four @entity55 appearances previously			0
yet the £ 12million buy from @entity57 hardly looked out of his depth			0
' the new @entity60 , ' was among the tags bestowed upon the 20 - year - old			0
and , as if being likened to a legendary @entity64 defender is not enough , he has been backed to emulate @entity1			0
@entity1 began his professional association with @entity32 in 1998 - the same year @entity6 arrived			1
that 's when the schooling began ahead of a partnership that would come to fruition in 2000			0
@entity6 was club captain - a torch that would later be passed to @entity1 in 2004 once his fellow centre - back departed			1
that promotion , however , would only be allowed with his tutor 's blessing			0
@entity27 executes a perfectly - timed tackle on @entity42 striker @entity76 in the 1 - 1 draw @entity27 tackles @entity76 as he looked to shoot past @entity32 goalkeeper @entity78 at @entity3 @entity27 closely marks @entity79 as he puts in a star performance for @entity32 against champions @entity42 @entity81 hailed @entity27 as ' one hell of a prospect ' after his performance against champions @entity42 once @entity1 hit 500 appearances last october , he set about thanking @entity6 ' who first and foremost gave me the opportunity to be captain of the club , and help me through and learn from the very best '			1
he added : ' i remember when i first got [ the armband ] @entity6 was captain , and he called a meeting with the management , ( @entity95 ) @entity94 , @entity96 , @entity97			2
' more than a decade on , it 's @entity1 's turn to look for a successor			2
a cool , composed , brave customer that did n't shy away from marking @entity105 's @entity104 , and had @entity106 and @entity76 to contend with on saturday			2
he knew when to go to ground , when to stay on his feet , and how to not let adrenaline or the situation get the better of him			0
quick , sharp , athletic ; worthy of @entity32			0
@entity79 learned about @entity27 's frightening pace , @entity76 discovered his perfect timing in tackles , and all this was streamed live to television screens in 650million homes across 175 countries			1
@entity6 and @entity1 celebrate an @entity118 win over @entity119 back in the day as the pair thrived in defence @entity27 and captain @entity1 were defensive partners as @entity32 booked their place in the @entity125 final @entity6 once recalled how @entity1 persistently pestered him , and that is what the man with the middle name ' happy ' must do			1
if only to impress his captain and teacher , like it did @entity6			2
' i regard @entity1 as an apprentice , but a precocious and cheeky one who barraged me with questions about tactics and positioning , and who once came to me with a detailed suggestion about how the physios , doctors and fitness coaches should fit into the team , ' @entity6 once said			1
' he was sharing his opinion , and to hear this from an 18 - or - 20 - year - old guy was something a bit special for me			0
' @entity40 is already prepared to trust @entity27			0
we know that , and so does he			0
he played like a man determined to keep @entity44 out in the cold against @entity105 and @entity42 , and rightly so			2
he 's making a name for himself , and has already interrupted @entity32 's formerly firm back two			1
next up , is the tutelage of @entity1			0
and that , it seems , has already begun			0
@entity1 trains with @entity6 during a @entity32 session when the pair played together between 1998 and 2004 @entity6 speaks to @entity1 during a @entity32 training session as the team prepare for a @entity55 match			1

@entity1 was tutored by @entity6 as he became @entity32 's captain
@entity27 has been favoured ahead of regular centre - back @entity44
@entity27 looked *comfortable* against @entity42 during their 1 - 1 draw
he kept @entity76 quiet and showed why he is ahead of @entity44
