if @entity1 is genuinely worried about the effect the captaincy of club and country will have on @entity6 , there is a very easy solution			1
give the armband to someone else			0
this is unthinkable , of course			0
there are no candidates of significance			0
@entity14 is @entity15 ’s only other club captain and he is not guaranteed his place			1
@entity18 is isolated in goal , @entity17 is without leadership experience			0
so it is not the job that may drain @entity6 , as @entity1 fears , but his status in @entity25 football			1
it must be hard being the main man , and that is a position he has occupied , armband or not , since 2004			2
@entity6 ( left ) is captain of @entity15 and will win his 100th cap against @entity32 on saturday @entity6 has also been given the armband by his club @entity34 @entity6 made his @entity15 debut against @entity36 in 2003 , aged just 17 that was the tournament @entity15 might have won , had @entity6 not got seriously injured in the quarter - final against @entity39			1
even so it remains a better campaign than @entity42 ever had , and he is remembered as an @entity15 hero			2
@entity6 should win his 100th cap against @entity32 on saturday and there will , no doubt , be plenty who sneer			2
yet he could one day end up as @entity15 ’s leading goalscorer and most capped player and these are achievements worthy of enormous respect			2
this is why there is little chance of @entity6 being weighed down by the captaincy : he has felt the weight as well as the joy of international football even from his earliest years			0
@entity60 , who managed @entity6 in @entity15 ’s under 17 team , recalls a young man who read aloud a poem at a team dinner speaking of his love of playing for his country			1
it is perhaps because @entity6 wants it so desperately that he can sometimes disappoint , or lose his way in anger			0
the real pity is that , shorn of team achievement , we are left to celebrate only personal milestones			0
@entity6 suffered an injury against @entity39 in the @entity79 quarter - final which @entity15 lost on penalties @entity6 curled home a free kick to ensure @entity15 beat @entity83 last month , his 43rd goal for his country despite his cheery demeanour in this picture , @entity1 fears the captaincy could harm @entity6 's form			1

@entity1 fears being captain could take its toll on @entity6
but really it is his status as @entity15 's main man that drains him
@entity14 is @entity15 ’s only other club captain
