' he is paranoid that everyone is looking at him and does from time to time wear clothing to hide it , scarves to avoid people asking questions			2
he does n't want to go out at all			0

' you now realise the enormity of what you did and realise how close mr @entity1 came to possibly losing his life			1
' quite why you behaved in the way you did , no one is likely to know			0
others who speak well of you are at a loss as to why you behaved the way you did			0

committing an offence whilst fuelled by alcohol is aggravating to the offence , it is not an excuse			0
' you committed the offence when mr @entity1 was leaving the premises where the party had taken place			1
' he was beyond the gateway , he was on the road walking away from the property when you attacked him when you had a glass in your hand			2
it may have been that when you left you did not have in your mind attacking him with the glass			0

' the effect on his has been quite substantial			0
he realises how close he came to losing his life			0
he is troubled at night			0
@entity0 was sentenced to three and a half years at @entity41 , above , today ' he ca n't fully understand why it happened			1
his confidence is at a very low ebb , understandably he is very self conscious			0
i have no reason to doubt it has had a significant impact upon his social life			0
' you used a glass as a weapon , thankfully it was not a weapon which was already smashed but even in its state it was still a weapon			0
' he added that he must also bear in mind @entity0 's previous convictions			1
' you have resorted to violence rather than walking away from violence			0
this incident occurred at what should have been an extremely happy event			2
' many people were present , they would have been understandably shocked by what they saw when mr @entity1 returned in his injured state			1
