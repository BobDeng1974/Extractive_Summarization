by @entity0 published : 12:06 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 04:17 est , 10 january 2014 ejected from his cockpit : flight lieutenant @entity4 , 35 , was fatally injured in 2011 a @entity8 aerial display team pilot who died after he was ejected from his cockpit while on the ground may have been impaired by @entity11 medicine , an inquest heard today			1
flight lieutenant @entity4 , 35 , was fatally injured after being ejected from his @entity13 aircraft while on the ground at @entity15 in @entity16			1
the parachute on the ejector seat did not deploy and the @entity21 - born airman - a well - respected and experienced pilot who was also an @entity22 war veteran - died in hospital			1
the inquest has now explored the possibility that the effects of night nurse might have played a part in his death			0
@entity16 coroner @entity31 read the findings of a post mortem exam report to the hearing in november 2011			2
he said tests showed flt lt @entity37 had used @entity27 , which includes the ingredient promethazine , the evening before the incident and , according to the report , the medication could cause some sedation and impair performance in pilots			1
‘ it is conceivable that side effects of this medication can include drowsiness , blurred vision , disorientation or poor concentration , and could have been responsible for a degree of cognitive impairment , but there is no way of proving this with certainty , ’ the inquest heard			0
however , in written evidence to the inquest another doctor reported it was very unlikely that any sedative effect had remained the following morning			0
accident scene : the parachute on the ejector seat did not deploy and the @entity21 - born airman - a well - respected and experienced pilot who was also an @entity22 war veteran - died in hospital ‘ it 's highly unlikely that the dose of night nurse taken on the evening of november 7 had any effects on the deceased 's ability to fly a plane at 11 o'clock the following morning			1
’ some of flt lt @entity37 's team - mates who were with him on the day of the incident told the inquest that he had appeared ‘ chirpy ’ and ‘ jovial ’ on the morning of november 8 and did not appear to be unwell or in an altered mood			1
other death : the tragedy happened just three months after the death of @entity8 pilot flight lieutenant @entity8 , 33 they had been preparing to fly in formation from @entity15 to @entity86 in @entity87 when they heard a loud bang			1
flt lt @entity90 said he was sitting in his aircraft and close to finishing his pre-flight checks , as was flt lt @entity37 who he could see from where he was positioned			2
‘ i just heard what to me seemed like an enormous bang very , very close , ’ he told the inquest			0
‘ the first thing i thought was that there was something wrong with my aircraft because it was so close to me and i could feel it			0
’ flt lt @entity90 said that once he had discounted the noise had come from his own plane he looked across at @entity105 , thinking he had experienced an ‘ engine surge ’			0
‘ i assumed it must have been @entity4 and i looked across at him and that 's when i realised that things were not normal			2
’ flt lt @entity90 said the canopy from the plane was missing and the ejector pole was sticking out , and he saw flt lt @entity37 was outside the aircraft , making him think he was going to see an ejection sequence in action			2
‘ i remember thinking that something appeared wrong and i expected the sequence to be happening a lot quicker , and the main thing was that i thought i should have seen a parachute in his apex , ’ he said			0
flt lt @entity37 was seen ‘ windmilling ’ his arms in the air before hitting the ground while still strapped to his ejector seat			1
the inquest heard that he fell from around 200 to 300ft			0
his cause of death was found to be from multiple injuries due to a fall from height following ejection from an aircraft			0
medicine : night nurse can cause some sedation and impair performance in pilots , the inquest heard following the incident , the @entity141 grounded all non-essential flying of aircraft fitted with the @entity146 - built ejector seat ‘ as a precaution ’ , but flights later resumed in december 2011 , with air chiefs saying they had ‘ no remaining safety concerns ’			1
@entity151 handed over a file concerning flt lt @entity37 's death , but the @entity154 subsequently said no charges would be brought in relation to the incident			2
the tragedy happened just three months after the death of @entity8 pilot flight lieutenant @entity8 , 33 , from @entity162 , who died in an air show crash near @entity165 in @entity166 in august 2011			1
flight lieutenant @entity167 , who had also been part of the aerial display but has since moved to a ground - based role , told the inquest she flew the same aircraft that flt lt @entity37 had been in on november 4 and found nothing unusual about it			1
the inquest also heard evidence in relation to features on the ejector seats relating to safety pins and the seat firing handle			2
flt lt @entity182 described an incident in september 2003 when she was an instructor at @entity86 and had been made acutely aware of the positioning of the handle and pins in relation to the ejector seat			1
she told the inquest that she had been flying with a student and became aware of a problem concerning the positioning of the handle after they had landed and were taxiing			0
she said she thought that her handle had become covered by the straps used to secure her in the seat and moved into the wrong position , and it seemed she had not fully inserted her safety pin , meaning she could have been easily ejected from the plane			0
‘ since that incident i truly believe that , if the handle is not correctly positioned , that seat pin will not go back in that hole			2
’ she continued : ‘ it strengthened my belief that i was probably millimetres away from movement that meant i was ejected			0
’ evidence from around 70 witnesses is expected during the inquiry , which is scheduled to last around three weeks			0
