by @entity0 published : 13:44 est , 30 january 2014 updated : 13:44 est , 30 january 2014 a big - busted cookery teacher who hoped to solve her back pain problems by having a breast reduction was left with a body she hated after surgery went disastrously wrong			1
@entity8 , 57 , went under the knife ten years ago to reduce the size of her @entity12 chest , but the botched operation left her with nipples placed abnormally high - so high she could n't even find a bra to cover them			1
@entity17 felt so self - conscious that she even began undressing in the dark so her husband @entity19 could n't see what had happened to her body			1
she says she ' felt like a freak '			2
she explained : ' my nipples look like they 've been plonked on too high			1
it 's a complete nightmare			0
i pop out of everything i put on ' @entity28 job : reduction surgery left @entity8 with lopsided breasts and ' abnormally ' positioned nipples one decade later @entity17 mustered the courage to write in to @entity33 show @entity34 , begging them to redo the operation			1
and after a successful operation she is finally happy with the way she looks			0
speaking about the trauma of the first operation , @entity17 said : ' i always had big breasts and i hated them			0
after i had children , they got bigger , and then they dropped and were virtually around my waist			0
my posture was terrible , i suffered from terrible back problems and eventually , i felt , well , enough is enough and i ca n't carry on like this			2
' supported by husband @entity19 , they dipped into their savings and pension so @entity8 could have the cosmetic procedure			1
' this was a dream come true - at long last , i thought i was going to be normal			2
but when the bandages were taken off , i could n't believe my eyes , ' @entity8 said			1
@entity8 had been left with lopsided nipples that were abnormally high			1
not only did this make her self - conscious in front of her husband , it also made it difficult for her to find underwear that was high enough to cover them			1
she explained : ' my nipples look like they 've been plonked on too high			1
it 's a complete nightmare			0
i pop out of everything i put on			0
' it makes me feel really unsexy			0
i hate myself and i 'm always aware of it every day and i just hate my body			2
i 've just been left looking like a freak			0
' they pop out : the mother said she could n't find bras to cover her high nipples she continued : ' i wo n't let my husband see me naked			1
i get dressed and undressed in the dark or turn round			0
' @entity8 applied to @entity33 show @entity76 to see if their resident surgeon dr @entity77 could salvage her appearance following the botched operation			1
dr @entity77 explained how the surgery went wrong because the surgeon positioned the nipples ' higher on the breast mound than they should be '			0
this then caused ' bottoming out ' - which occurs when the skin that was stitched together during the operation can no longer support the weight of the chest and gravity takes hold			2
the breasts descent but the nipples do n't			2
fixed : @entity8 went on @entity76 and had another op to reposition her nipples which she is delighted with ' it never ceases to amaze me when i see appalling surgeries but it makes me more determined to sort them out , ' dr @entity77 said			1
dr @entity77 operates on @entity8 to redress the previous problem and this time , she is delighted with the end result			2
she said : ' i can wear a bra , i can wiggle around and nothing 's popping out ! they 're perfect			0
it 's changed the whole way i feel about myself , my confidence , my posture - it means so much to me			0
' she added : ' i feel feminine , i feel sexy , i 'm a lot more confident than i ever was , i 'm happy to wear low tops and it 's just made so much difference to me			0
' @entity76 is on @entity115 at 8pm			0

@entity8 , 57 , tried to reduce @entity12 chest , but ended up ' looking like a freak '
nipples were placed abnormally high , meaning bras did n't cover them
she began undressing in the dark so her husband could n't see her body
she endured feelings of *extreme* self - *consciousness* for a decade
has now had second op on @entity34 to repair damage
