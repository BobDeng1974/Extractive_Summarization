by @entity0 published : 17:26 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 03:11 est , 31 may 2013 the bad fairy at my birth cursed me with fine hair			1
ever since , i have longed to be like my friends who all have thick , lustrous locks			2
their hair bounces into a glorious frame for their faces , while mine lies flat and shapeless , clinging to my skull , making my big face look even bigger			2
i have tried ‘ volumising ’ shampoos — what a con			2
i have slathered my follicles with ‘ root lifting ’ mousses and sprays — another waste of money			2
for the past 30 years @entity0 has been wearing wigs on television and the red carpet i watch my friends effortlessly shake their hair into shape , and try to sympathise when they claim they have had a ‘ @entity27 ’			1
come on , girls , you have no idea what it is like to have a @entity33			2
and so i have a confession to make			2
for the past 30 years plus , if you ’ve seen me on the television or on the red carpet , it ’s likely i ’ve been wearing a wig			1
i first took the desperate step of buying one when i was in my early 30s			1
since then , i ’ve often worn one when presenting a show or at an event or job that needed a bit of bounce , a bit of glamour			1
today , i have seven wigs , because each time i ’ve changed the colour of my hair , i ’ve had to buy a new one in the same new colour			1
@entity53 forbid a real tendril should escape from underneath the wig , exposing my terrible secret			1
wigs can be terribly expensive — thousands of pounds if they are made from real hair			1
but aside from the expense , i ’ve never liked the idea of real hair			2
it feels tasteless and exploitative to wear tresses cut from the heads of nuns or penniless @entity66 farmers ’ wives			2
so i ’ve gone for the cheap and cheerful nylon variety — the kind that costs around £ 80 , that you can pack at the bottom of a suitcase , then shake out and pull on like a hat			2
alas , i have eventually learned that on me , it looks exactly like what it is — a cheap wig on a desperate woman with baby - fine hair			1
this is why i ’ve decided to come clean about my secret wig addiction — and give them up from now on			1
@entity0 decided to go for the cheapb and cheerful nylon variety - the kind that costs around £ 80 when i started wearing them , i took as my role models the famous , glamorous women , the sex symbols , who are quite open about the fact that they spend their lives in wigs			1
i recently saw @entity93 at a party , now a glorious 80 years old , wearing a hugely exuberant head of hair			2
it must have been heavy and hot , but the lady wore it with style — though i slightly prefer the shorter , more businesslike wigs she wore to villainous effect in @entity103			1
carry on actress @entity105 wears wigs and extensions — she has soft , fine hair that refuses to frame her face , like mine			1
i once shared a hairdresser ’s salon with @entity113			2
not the whole diva , mind you — just her wig			1
and when @entity121 interviewed @entity122 , gazing with awe at her ornate construction of ringlets and asking , ‘ @entity122 , how long does it take to do your hair ? ’ she replied , ‘ i do n’t know			2
when i bought my first wig , i was working as a television presenter for @entity129			1
i had just been arrested for handing out bat stew to passers - by in the street as a stunt for the show ( not because the stew was dangerous , but the police said i was causing an obstruction )			2
the paparazzi gathered round me as i was released from the police station			2
as it was raining at the time , my thin hair was left straggling over my face and head			2
when i saw the pictures , enough was enough			2
i was then a regulation television - presenter streaky - blonde colour , so i bought myself a blonde wig			1
my late husband @entity147 hated it			2
he declared it looked like a shaggy mountain goat , and would even wear it himself , claiming it suited him better than it did me			0
but i thought from a distance it was passable , so i persevered			0
such was my fear of showing off those thin strands again			0
but my wig was a nightmare in a high wind — i thought it might take off at any moment — and no good at all in my open - top car			1
i once had to slam on the brakes and chase it down the road , hoping the neighbours would think i was saving the life of a much - loved chihuahua			0
did you spot the difference ? @entity0 shows off her real hair now she has decided to ditch the wigs @entity174 , the famously red - haired politician who often wore a wig for public occasions , once warned me how important it is to anchor your wig with pins			1
she described the time she was asked to lay a foundation stone on a building site , and a piece of wire protruding from a door frame hooked the smart red wig , leaving it swinging over her head while she had to carry on without it			1
but i could never find the right pins to use as anchors — no matter how spiky or painful , they would never stick the wig to my head			1
i soon got caught out			0
one red carpet awards ceremony i was presenting took place in a faraway seaside town			0
the organisers sent a stretch limo to take me there and bring me home			0
i dragged on a wig and hoped for the best			1
my first hurdle was getting in and out of the limo			0
if i hit my head on the door - frame , i knew the wig would topple off			1
by bending double , i somehow managed to keep my hair on			0
but it was a long night and i fell asleep on the way home			0
i woke to see the driver pointing a camera at me			0
the wig had revolved , so the hair at the back now covered my face			1
i tried to smile while pulling nylon hair out of my teeth			0
i still dread those pictures emerging somewhere			0
but that first blonde wig did have its fans			1
magician @entity220 once told me how much he liked my new hairdo — illusionist he might be , but he certainly fell for my illusion			0
by contrast , the late @entity224 saw through it at once			0
‘ that ’s a wig , ’ he bellowed at a film premiere			1
‘ no it ’s not , ’ i said weakly			0
why did i lie ? because wearing fake hair makes me feel guilty , even ashamed			0
i learned to live with the feeling			0
when i appeared on @entity232 in their eyes , i bought a jet - black wig to help me look like singer @entity236 , whom i was impersonating			1
to this day , i call that wig @entity238			1
@entity236 must be revolving in her grave			0
with @entity240 , the thought of having to dance the rumba , the ‘ dance of love ’ , with @entity247 , sent me running to the wig department in @entity244			1
anything to distract the judges from my feet			0
red hair is a nightmare to keep dying so @entity0 decided to grow it out for the first time in 40 years i found a bright red number ( which i christened ‘ @entity257 ’ after mrs @entity256 ) and had my own hair dyed to match it			1
sadly , my wig failed to distract the judges from my rumba — ‘ disaster , darling ’ was their verdict			1
in real life , too , @entity257 fooled nobody			0
i was wearing @entity257 when i met comedienne @entity268			0
she looked straight at my hairline			0
as my wig was approximately @entity268 ’s colour i hoped she might approve			1
‘ is that a wig ? ’ she said accusingly			1
this time i decided to be honest			1
‘ of course , ’ i said , feeling embarrassed as she tried to contain her laughter			0
red hair is a nightmare to keep dying , so finally i decided to let it grow out for the first time in 40 years			1
as my real colour emerged after so long under wraps , i expected it to be grey or white			0
@entity283 would have been fine — it ’s supposedly slightly thicker and coarser			0
for once , i thought , i might have a frame to my face			0
but lo ! it turns out that , like my father , i have n’t gone grey			0
my hair is still brown and as wispy as ever			0
so now i ’ve had to buy myself a brunette wig , this time from a wig specialist in @entity294 ’s @entity293			1
i wore it for the first time in earnest at a recent @entity298			1
i washed my hair , did what i could with rollers and mousse , decided it was n’t enough , and at the last moment , on went the wig			1
it was hot and itchy , but once it was on , it was there for the whole night			0
the show was followed by a party with the cream of show business			0
as i greeted each one , i saw to my horror that their eyes were fixed on my hairline			0
when i went to the loo i saw why			0
the wig had lifted so that it looked like a hairy balloon on the back of my head , with my real fringe poking out at the front			1
it was the final humiliation			0
after many years and many hairy incarnations , i have to conclude that wigs are a total nightmare			2
my advice is that if you have your own hair — any amount of your own hair — stick with it and find a good hairdresser			0
and so , for the first time in more than 30 years , i ’m going to try to manage without the wigs i ’ve become so peculiarly reliant on			2
looking back , i do n’t think really they ’ve ever done me any favours			0
my hair may be flat , fine and limp , but it ’s still my own			0
and i ’d rather have the shame of a flat do than constantly live with the fear of a gust of wind revealing my terrible , hair - raising secret .			0

@entity0 first took the step of buying a wig in her early 30s
she often wore one when she fancied a bit of bounce or to add a bit glamour
but the television presented has finally decided to ditch the wigs
