he added : ' it was a busy and challenging night			1
we attended more than 40 incidents and our limited resources were stretched at times			2
' sadly , we attended one incident in which an elderly man had died			1
it appears that he had been overcome by smoke from a slow - burning fire in his kitchen			1
' the fire was out when we got there and had occurred several hours earlier			2
' there was also a fire at a factory in @entity42			2
crews were there for more than three hours			2
at this stage the cause has yet to be determined			2
' firefighters left their stations at 6pm yesterday and will not return until 6pm on tuesday , the evening before @entity49 , with brigades across @entity52 warning they may struggle to respond			1
the @entity54 brigade warned that the service and the public will be left in a ' vulnerable position ' , telling people to take extra care to ensure their own safety			0
the @entity62 brigade said it might not attend bin or small grass fires , or help anyone shut in a lift during the strike			1

' this is a case of those at the top getting more while everyone else is robbed blind			0
firefighters are sickened by the government 's ' snouts in the trough ' approach to this issue			0
' how can it be remotely fair that the prime minister , already a millionaire , enjoys a far greater subsidy from his employer in absolute and proportional terms than a firefighter who is earning less than £ 30,000 a year ? it is sickening hypocrisy			0
' @entity121 general secretary @entity120 said : ' once again the government is showing its contempt for public service workers			0
' evidence warns that raising the normal retirement age for firefighters would lead to older fighters facing no job and no pension after years of good service			0
' this same evidence has already led to concessions being made in @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 - but the @entity74 has chosen to walk away from the negotiating table			0
' we are very concerned about the risks to firefighters , and those who rely on the fire service , when firefighters are forced to stay in frontline service until they reach the age of 60			0
