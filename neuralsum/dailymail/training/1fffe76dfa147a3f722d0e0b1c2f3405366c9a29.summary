a pygmy possum , who chose the wrong place for a midday nap , would have awoken to the shock of her life when she realised she was more than 90km from home			1
the little critter was found quietly hiding in a mail bag last week by surprised mail sorter , @entity12 , who had unknowingly driven it from @entity15 to the @entity17 post office on the southern @entity18 in @entity19			1
after originally assuming it was a mouse , the 16 - year - old soon realised that the big - eyed , curly - tailed marsupial he 'd found was far more special			1
this full grown femal pygmy possum was found in a mail bag after choosing the spot for a nap ' you hardly ever seen pygmy possums , they 're a very secretive animal , ' @entity31 from @entity32 and @entity33 told @entity34			1
' i 've only ever seen them when we 've done targeted trapping			0
you do n't see them out in the wild because they hide amongst leaf litter and trees so it was definitely a special occasion			2
' down in the country , we have personal mail bags that get left in front of a property and this bag was left in a sealed drum and obviously the pygmy possum had found its way into the drum and into the bag to have a little bit of a snooze			1
' she was found by surprised mail sorter , @entity12 , who had unknowingly driven it the 90km from @entity15 to the @entity17 post office on the southern @entity18 in @entity19 ms @entity31 , who personally travelled to collect the full - grown female in order to have it sent back home , described it as being ' very frisky ' and curious ' rather than scared			1
' she was n't stressed at all			0
when i got hold of her to check her sex , she was completely calm , ' she said			0
' they 're quite a docile animal , once they realise you 're not a threat to their lives they relax quite quickly			0
' she said she collected some flowers from the bush for the possum to feed on until it was returned to its home			2
once at the post office ( pictured ) @entity31 from @entity32 and @entity33 was called to collect and care for the possum until it could be taken back home ' luckily the post office staff made note of the bag it was found in so we were able to identify its territory and a staff member who lives near the property where it was collected , dropped it off on her way home , ' ms @entity31 said			2
' if you do find an animal , make sure to keep it somewhere dark , quiet and cool and not too look at it too much until you can call for help to get it home			0
' ms @entity31 said pygmy possums were similar to ring tail possums only they appear as if they have ' been put in a shrink machine '			0
' they fit in the palm of your hand and are a similar size to a mouse , but plumper with larger eyes , large rounded ears and a curly ringed tail			0

a full grown female pygmy possum was found in a mail bag in @entity19 where it had fallen *asleep*
the palm - size animal is normally quite secretive and difficult to find , making it a special occasion for mail sorter @entity12 , 16
the big - eyed , curly - tailed marsupial was returned to its home last week
