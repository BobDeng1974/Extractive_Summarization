a mother has hit out after a princess @entity1 at her daughter 's fifth birthday party looked nothing like the @entity6 character			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , east @entity9 , had previously provided her own entertainment at daughter @entity12 's birthday parties , but decided to pay £ 175 this year for the professional @entity14 act			1
she has been left furious after the entertainer turned up late and wore an ill - fitting wig and a sweaty dress that kept falling down			2
ms @entity7 said the entertainer looked ' like she 'd left a rave at 6am ' and sung a 70s rock ballad rather than hit song from the @entity6 film			1
writing on her blog , she wrote : ' apparently the @entity1 outfit had been worn by another entertainer earlier that day and was wet with sweat			2
' so our entertainer decided to put the outfit on over the top of her own clothes , which happened to be black			0
' she did n’t even bother to put the costume shoes on and wore a pair of tatty black flat shoes			0
the dress came undone at the back , someone did it up for her , but it would n’t stay done up , so she left it to hang off			0
' when one of the children asked the woman where princess @entity1 was , she replied : ' @entity1 could n’t come to the party , so i am here instead			1
' ms @entity7 added : ' the last thing our daughter said quietly to me before she went to bed that night was : " @entity64 , why did n’t @entity1 come to my party ? ” which is not how i had imagined her birthday party day would end			1
ms @entity7 said parents struggled not to laugh as the stand - in performer struggled through the act ' the poor service also ruined the party for my husband and me			1
previously we ’ve done the entertainment ourselves at parties , and this year we had wanted to relax and enjoy watching our daughter having fun at her party			2
' this was our daughter ’s 5th birthday party , it was meant to be a really special and magical occasion for her			2
we worked really hard as parents to make it happen			0
we were totally let down			0
' ms @entity7 - who had paid half up front - phoned up the agency to complain during the party , but was told to hand over the rest of the cash otherwise she could n't later complain			1
the married mum , who runs blog mums make lists , posted a photo of the apparent - lookalike on her personal website , which has been viewed more than 30,000 times			0
one mum wrote said : " genuinely appalled at @ @entity98 - be ashamed of yourselves ! @entity100 spread magic , not shatter dreams ! ? the company , which said an alternative performer had to be brought in at the last minute , has apologised to ms @entity7 and agreed to pay a 50 % refund			1
explaining the appearance of the entertainer in the photos , a statement on its website read : ' sometimes pictures , we all know , can look worst than reality because of the moment too			0
anyway we agree that she didnt have the time to prepare all well			0
' the statement went on : ' we , entertainers , are humans , and as any other person , feel pressure and go down when we feel nothing we do is ok			0
the entertainer suffered a lot of judgement and it made it much more difficult			0
' we assume the responsibility of the delay , the wet costume and therefore not having the right amount of time to prepare , but i think that if the party was so important as we also think it should be , @entity7 should have go to the entertainer [ sic ] and give the time she needed to look great			2
' there has been a surge in demand for princess @entity1 performers since the animated film hit cinema screens			1

parents paid £ 175 for hour - and - a - half entertainment by performer
she was meant to be princess @entity1 , the ice queen from @entity6 hit frozen
but *family* says party was ' ruined ' by lateness and shoddy costume
@entity155 apologises and says it had to replace performer at last minute
