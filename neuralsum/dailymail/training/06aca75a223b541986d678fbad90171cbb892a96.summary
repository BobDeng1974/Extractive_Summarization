it was intended for use in experiments in automated facial recognition to try to find terror suspects			0
anger : internet giant @entity9 reacted furiously to the claims , branding them a ' whole new level of violation ' rather than collecting webcam chats in their entirety , the system saved one image every five minutes from the users ’ feeds between 2008 and 2010			1
' unfortunately … it would appear that a surprising number of people use webcam conversations to show intimate parts of their body to the other person ' @entity6 but documents leaked to @entity62 revealed that sexually explicit pictures proved to be a problem for @entity6			1
one comment from the agency read said : ‘ unfortunately … it would appear that a surprising number of people use webcam conversations to show intimate parts of their body to the other person			2
‘ also , the fact that the @entity9 software allows more than one person to view a webcam stream without necessarily sending a reciprocal stream means that it appears sometimes to be used for broadcasting pornography			1
’ internet giant @entity9 reacted furiously to the claims			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we were not aware of , nor would we condone , this reported activity			0
ongoing : in its latest report on files leaked by @entity28 whistleblower @entity27 ( pictured ) , the @entity62 newspaper claims a surveillance programme collected still images of @entity9 webcam chats ‘ this report , if true , represents a whole new level of violation of our users ’ privacy that is completely unacceptable and we strongly call on the world ’s governments to reform surveillance law consistent with the principles we outlined in december			1
' this report , if true , represents a whole new level of violation of our users ' privacy that is completely unacceptable and we strongly call on the world 's governments to reform surveillance law consistent with the principles we outlined in december ' @entity9 spokesman ' we are committed to preserving our users ’ trust and security and continue our efforts to expand encryption across all of our services			1
’ @entity112 mp @entity111 said : ‘ this is , frankly , creepy			0
it is perfectly proper for our intelligence agencies to use any and all means to target people for whom there are reasonable grounds for suspicion of terrorism , kidnapping and other serious crimes			0
