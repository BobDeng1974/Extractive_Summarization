by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 21:58 est , 10 september 2013 updated : 09:48 est , 11 september 2013 the troubled @entity3 project has hit the buffers again after it emerged the man in charge of championing it has been forced to take three weeks off work with a bad leg			1
as @entity12 ordered a ' fightback ' to rescue the £ 42billion scheme from a growing opposition , its chairman @entity10 has torn a calf muscle and will be absent from work as the first legislation is introduced to @entity19			1
the revelation added to the mounting sense of chaos around the project as it enters a critical stage			0
in his bid to keep the flagship policy alive , he will say it is as vital as a ‘ heart bypass ’ for the clogged arteries of @entity38 ’s overcrowded railways			1
in a combative speech , the he will highlight new analysis by top @entity48 accountants showing that the true benefits of the @entity51 - shaped @entity35 line linking the capital to the @entity53 and the @entity54 could boost the @entity38 economy by £ 15billion a year – with regions gaining ‘ at least double ’ the benefit of @entity29			1
the accountants say it provides ‘ hard evidence ’ that @entity35 will pay for itself within a few years putting the government ’s case ‘ beyond reasonable doubt			2
’ staunch supporter : transport secretary @entity32 will defend the government 's controversial @entity35 rail scheme in a speech today ministers say the previous @entity68 cost - benefit analysis failed to take account of the full benefits to the regions which the new @entity73 study has addressed			1
but the @entity74 said the minster was simply getting sharp accountants to dress up the figures in a ‘ propaganda exercise ’ based on ‘ dodgy assumptions in the government ’s own business case ’ to protect an expensive and unnecessary ‘ white elephant ’			0
mr @entity10 as previously warned that it would be ' catastrophic ' for the country if the project did not go ahead			1
but according to @entity87 , there was already concern that he was not doing enough to publicly support it			0
the news that his leg injury will mean he is away from work for three months will only add to the sense of a lack of leadership			0
' captain @entity98 gets even more time hiding in his garden , ' one industry source told the newspaper , referring to a nickname given to mr @entity10 by his critics			2
today ’s speech by mr @entity32 marks the official start of a government ‘ fightback ’ against detractors including residents blighted by the line , mps , taxpayer and protest groups , who say it ’s a waste of money			1
controversy has dogged the 351 mile scheme which is planned to run through leafy @entity120 heartlands in @entity121 and @entity122 using 225mph trains to link @entity29 to @entity30 and beyond to @entity124 and @entity125			0
on monday a damning report by the powerful commons ’ @entity126 said ministers had failed to make a ‘ value for money ’ case for the scheme whose costs were ‘ spiralling ’			2
the spending watchdog said the government ’s case was based on ‘ fragile numbers , out - of - date data and assumptions which do not reflect real life ’			0
and it feared it would simply ‘ suck ’ more money into @entity29 rather than benefit the regions			0
but in his keynote speech today , mr @entity32 will argue that only a new high speed rail line will reduce worsening overcrowding on the railways and that the alternative of an upgrade to the already stretched @entity150 would be like ‘ trying to run the @entity151 up the @entity152 ’			1
he will hail @entity35 as ‘ our chance to level the playing field between @entity156 ’			2
highlighting new research published by @entity48 accountants @entity73 on the economic benefits of the scheme , he will say : ‘ @entity35 will make @entity161 stronger			1
' @entity38 stronger - a £ 15 billion annual boost to the economy - with the north and midlands gaining at least double the benefit of the @entity167			1
’ @entity73 accountants calculate that the boost to @entity30 's economy will be equivalent to between 2.1 per cent to 4.2 per cent of the city region 's economic output ( gross domestic product or gdp )			2
anger : the scheme has attracted much opposition particularly in the rural areas that the line will run through there will be between 0.8 per cent and 1.7 per cent benefit to @entity124 , 1.6 per cent for @entity125 and 0.5 per cent for @entity29			0
the @entity182 could also benefit from £ 5billion a year in extra tax receipts as a result of the boost to the economy , says the @entity73 report			1
it adds that the vexed debate about the ‘ lap - top ’ effect on the value of time saved on rail journeys is ‘ a red herring ’			0
passionate : @entity12 has expressed his full support for the scheme in the face of an ' unholy alliance ' of opposition mr @entity32 has already admitted that the government ‘ got it wrong ’ when making speed and faster journey times the biggest selling - point for @entity35 , and should have concentrated on benefits			1
to critics who complain of a spiralling budget he will hit - back : ’ let me spell it out			0
the budget for @entity35 is £ 42.6 billion			2
not the scare stories from opponents			0
' and that is an upper limit with a £ 14.4billion contingency in reserve which we are determined to bear down on			0
’ he believes the report provides the ‘ hard evidence ’ needed to convince sceptics			0
@entity222 , @entity73 's head for infrastructure , building and construction said his firm 's analysis ‘ shows beyond reasonable doubt that @entity35 brings net benefits to the country of many times the scheme 's cost ’			1
he added : ' the @entity38 will be £ 15 billion a year better off with @entity35 , recovering the cost of the scheme within just a few years			1
' but @entity235 , chief executive of the @entity236 ’ @entity74 , said it was ‘ an expensive propaganda exercise ’ adding : ‘ the government has squandered taxpayers ’ money on a cynical attempt to win over the many , many people who think this white elephant is the wrong way to spend tens of billions of pounds of their money			0
’ prime minister @entity12 has expressed ‘ passionate ’ support for @entity35 in the face of an ‘ unholy alliance ’ of sceptics			1
vocal : @entity254 , left , has spoken out against @entity35 despite first approving it as chancellor , while @entity257 shadow transport secretary @entity256 has said the government must redouble its efforts to make @entity35 a reality high profile critics have included @entity257 's @entity254 who first approved it as chancellor , and the @entity263 which dismissed it as ‘ a grand folly ’			2
but @entity257 has given conditional support to @entity35 providing costs are capped			0
shadow transport secretary @entity256 said : ‘ the government must now redouble their efforts to make the new north - south rail line a reality and ensure it remains on budget and on track			0

@entity35 chairman @entity10 will be absent from work as just as @entity12 orders ministers to launch a ' fightback '
@entity32 describes scheme as a ' heart bypass ' for @entity38 's railways
