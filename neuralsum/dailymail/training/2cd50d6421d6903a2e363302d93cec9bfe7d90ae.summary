a team of scientists and documentary makers will attempt to find ' the loneliest whale in the world ' next autumn by tracking its route across the @entity7			1
the researchers have been listening to the animal 's abnormally high song for over 20 years but have never seen what it looks like			1
the unknown whale is called ' lonely ' because it appears to communicate at a frequency not used by any other whale in the @entity7 , and so far , it is not thought to have ever got a response to its plaintive cries			1
a team of scientists and documentary makers will attempt to find ' the loneliest whale in the world ' next autumn			1
the creature has been calling out at a frequency not used by any other whales in the @entity7 for the last 20 years experts believe the huge mammal is most likely a fin whale , but could be a blue whale , or a hybrid of the two species , @entity25 reported			1
the @entity32 began passing recordings of whale song to scientists in the late 1980s			1
it picked up the haunting noises when trying to listen for submarines in the @entity7			2
in 1989 , dr @entity39 of the @entity40 began to sort through the recordings and noticed that one whale 's song was much higher in pitch than the others			2
most male fin and blue whales sing at around 17 to 18 hertz , which is too deep for humans to hear , but the ' lonely ' whale communicates at 52 hertz			0
when more recordings were released in the nineties , dr @entity39 studied the 52 hertz whale more closely			0
scientists have been listening to the whale for two decades but no - one has seen it , so they are not sure exactly what species they are looking for			2
experts believe the huge mammal is is most likely that it is a fin whale ( pictured ) but could be a hybrid of a blue and a fin whale dr @entity39 ' team was able to triangulate its movements and track its location across the ocean during mating season , when whales are at their most vocal and published a paper on his findings in 2004			2
@entity71 , who was involved with the research said that it is usually incredibly difficult to track a whale across the ocean without seeing it as the animals make noises at the same frequency , making it almost impossible to pick out individuals			2
the study attracted much media attention and the 52 hertz animal was dubbed ' the loneliest whale in the world ' as its high - pitched song did not seem to get a response from other whales			1
as dr @entity39 sadly died from cancer before his research captured the imagination of the public , his research assistant ms @entity71 has carried on his scientific legacy			0
most male blue and fin whales ( pictured ) sing at around 17 to 18 hertz , which is too deep for humans to hear , but the ' lonely ' whale communicates at 52 hertz			0
dr @entity39 ' team has used its song to triangulate its movements and track its location across the ocean during mating season she said that the team has never seen the whale they have been studying and do not know what species it is			1
they do not know if it is medically unusual but she said it is obviously healthy as it has been living for at least two decades			0
however , when it came to musing about the creature 's loneliness , ms @entity71 said : ' is he alone ? i do n’t know			0
' people like to imagine this creature out there swimming by his lonesome , just singing away and nobody ’s listening			0
but i ca n’t say that			0
' scientists may find out more about the mysterious whale when they search for it next @entity126			1
while the whale has been dubbed the ' loneliest in the world ' as its calls seem to be going unanswered , scientists are not so sure			1
they can not say for sure that the creature is completely alone			0
a blue whale is pictured			0
