@entity0 has awarded biggest prize in aviation history to an electric plane after its team designed a craft that flew 200miles in two hours			1
the $ 1.35million prize was handed to the crew behind the @entity9 plane designed by the @entity11 team			2
the @entity9 was in competition against two other craft as part of the @entity16 final , backed by @entity0 , which aimed to make green air travel a realistic possibility			1
it 's electric : the @entity9 plane which won a $ 1.35million prize from @entity0 as part of the @entity16 final on the ground : the @entity9 is a twin fuselage design , meaning it has two cockpits either side of a large central propeller a second prize of $ 120,000 was awarded to the very close runner - up , @entity31 - based @entity30 , while the third entrant - a gasoline - powered plane from @entity36 - based @entity35 team - left empty handed			1
some 14 teams entered the competition in its early stages with planes powered variously by electric engines , biofuels and gasoline engines , but the two prize - winners were both electric aircraft			0
' two years ago the thought of flying 200 miles at 100 mph in an electric aircraft was pure science fiction , ' said @entity49 , team leader of @entity50			0
' now , we are all looking forward to the future of electric aviation			0
' runner up : the @entity30 aircraft came a very close second to the @entity9 , but it did win the $ 10,000 @entity57 prize for the quietest aircraft in flight : the @entity30 soared majestically over the countryside ultra-light : the @entity30 was partly funded by @entity61 , the @entity62 aviation giant @entity0 said that the @entity9 's feat of meeting its requirements to win the competition had proved ' ultra-efficient aviation is within our grasp			1
' dual - fuselage design ultralight construction @entity71 : 75ft propeller : 6.5ft - wide powered by : 450lbs of lithium - polymer batteries ' today we 've shown that electric aircraft have moved beyond science fiction and are now in the realm of practice , ' said @entity79 , @entity0 's acting chief technologist			1
to win the prize the @entity9 had to fly 200 miles in less than two hours and use less than one gallon of fuel per occupant , or the equivalent in electricity			1
both the winner and runner up achieved better efficiency than required and completed the challenge on the equivalent of just over a half - gallon of fuel per passenger			0
historic links : @entity57 , the grandson of aviation pioneer @entity92 , was present to award the $ 10,000 @entity94 to the runner - up , @entity30 @entity96 : @entity92 pictured in 1927 with his famous spirit of @entity99 plane in which he became the first man to fly solo across the @entity101 the @entity9 flew a round trip from @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity31 , and while it was only required to fly 200 miles for the competition the crew says it could already fly four people up to 300 miles on its current power source			2
the prize - giving is the culmination of more than two years of aircraft design , development and testing for the teams , who collectively spent more than $ 4million in pursuit of the prize			2
@entity118 ( @entity118 ) organises the competition under an agreement with @entity0 , which regularly uses competitions to encourage new blood into its technology research programmes for spaceflight and aeronautics			0
major historical competitions have included the $ 25,000 @entity126 for nonstop trans - @entity101 flight			0
that prize was won by @entity92 whose grandson , @entity57 , was present to award the $ 10,000 @entity94 to the runner - up , @entity131 .			0

@entity9 craft flew 200miles in two hours to win @entity0 's $ 1.35m prize
