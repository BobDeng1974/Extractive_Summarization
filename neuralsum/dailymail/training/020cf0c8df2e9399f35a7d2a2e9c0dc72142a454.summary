with their trademark maroon berets , the soldiers from this elite regiment pride themselves on being the fittest of the fit			1
which is why those wanting to join the @entity9 's @entity8 have to pass one of toughest job interviews imaginable			1
the 28 - week training course which must be passed in order to become a paratrooper has become famous within the forces for its sheer intensity			1
now , for the first time in 30 years , camera crews have gone inside the regiment 's training camp to follows the fresh - faced recruits as they find out what it takes to earn the coveted maroon beret			1
when filming began there were 34 recruits - but by the end of the course , only eight of those are left to take their first step into the @entity9			1
the fly - on - the - wall footage , called @entity46 : earning the maroon beret , also includes an in - depth look at ' @entity49 ' , the famously gruelling final test which makes or breaks the strongest of recruits			1
the eight tests which make up @entity49 include the stretcher race – in which recruits carry a metal stretcher weighing almost 180lbs over five miles – and the 60ft high aerial assault course , designed to see if the men can jump out of an airplane			1
during the episodes , the wannabe soldiers are seen physically retching as they test their physical limits			2
they are pushed to the point of exhaustion as they are filmed wading through knee - deep water and clambering over giant obstacles - only to be told to get up and start all over again			1
more than anything , the course is the chance to ' take the civilian head off their shoulders for three and put them into a military environment '			2
and , if they succeed in doing that , the rewards are huge			0
in the first episode , the men are shown arriving at @entity35 - where the @entity9 trains all its infantry recruits - for their @entity81			1
the @entity81 is an initial three - day test to see whether or not the men have the endurance to take on the full 28 - week training course			1
course commander corporal @entity86 , who has done three tours of @entity88 , puts the men through their paces using a series of tough physical assessments , designed to assess their fitness and determination			1
for the first time in 30 years , cameras have gone inside the training camp to document the young men from their arrival at the @entity35 , @entity36 , through to their @entity100 , seven months later but - incase they ever dare start to get ahead of themselves - the men are constantly reminded how far they have to go : ' you are not paratroopers yet , gents			1
you are far from that , ' they are told			0
explaining why the course is so tough , corporal @entity86 tells the camera : ' we do n't go looking for these recruits			1
these recruits come to us			1
you either want to be here or you do n't			0
' if you do n't , no problem to us , we will leave you where you are			0
but if you want to be here , you want to be part of the best regiment , you 've got to step up to the task			1
the recruits ' first day is a snapshot of what is to come			2
the men must complete a physical fitness assessment - including 48 sit ups and 48 press ups in two minutes - as well as a 1.5mile run in less than ten minutes			2
some of the tough obstacles which the men have to complete include a steeplechase , dotted with tough obstacles ( right ) and swathes of muddy water ( left ) they are also expected to complete a two - mile steeplechase - dotted with tough obstacles and swathes of muddy water - in less than 21 minutes			1
@entity139 tells the camera that , apart from wading through deep water against the clock , the men will be ruined from the blisters they sustain by running for probably the first - time ever in chunky army boots			1
and it 's that event which claims the first casualty of the course , who is seen slumped against the wall , shattered and half - broken			2
but the men barely have a second to get over their exhaustion , being told to ' stop feeling sorry for themselves ' because it is ' the easiest event in the world '			0
the recruits are then made to do a four - mile ' leg burner ' run over difficult and unforgiving terrain			1
corporal @entity86 explains the lengths that some recruits have gone to , in a bid to ensure they pass the test			1
he said : ' you have got to pour blood , sweat , tears to get up it			0
we have had guys that have been crawling up it , trying to get up there with their nails just to get up the top of it			0
' we are not setting them up for it , we are just setting up to see if they can do it			0
' the recruits are also made to do a four - mile ' leg burner ' run over difficult and unforgiving terrain , which the course commander said you have to ' pour blood , sweat , tears to get up ' the recruits are also put through the trainasium - a 60ft training assault , unique to the regiment			1
expected to run and jump at heights , the event simulates the so - called exit phase of a parachute jump			2
corporal @entity86 explains : ' it is the event that conquers your fear of heights			1
you can either do it , or you ca n't			0
' if you ca n't do a 60ft beam walk in the air , there is no way you will be jumping out of a @entity203 at 800ft			0
there 's just no way			0
' the documentary follows the journey of some of the individuals who have embarked on the course , who come from all walks of life			0
there 's a 26 - year - old who used to be a support worker competing side - by - side with a man who is trying his luck for the second time , after leaving the army , aged 16			1
corporal @entity86 said there are several soldiers who comes from difficult backgrounds , who want to join the @entity8 to better themselves			1
another of the challenges involving boxing with one another - something which causes many recruits to fall at the final hurdle meanwhile , private @entity230 explains how he gave up the chance of going to university to take a shot at the course			1
he said : ' i always wanted to do it since i was tiny			0
i always wanted to join the army			0
i joined because i wanted to make a difference and to have a bit of meaning			0
i wanted to join the @entity8 because it is the elite unit			0
' and for private @entity241 , who worked as a support worker with those with learning difficulties , joining the @entity8 is a way of escaping his mundane life on ' @entity247 '			0
he said : ' when you 're on @entity247 , you feel like you 're doing nowt , not achieving nowt			0
' if you want to do something remarkable with your life , because you 're only living it once			0
' the @entity8 is the airborne infantry element of @entity254			0
it is an infantry force with expertise air - land deployments , by helicopter , airplane or parachute			2
it is also trained to provide direct support to @entity262 , with whom it maintains close links			0
the regiment was created after @entity267 , speaking in june 1940 , called for the formation of an elite corps of troops , of at least 5,000 parachute troops			2
a @entity272 was established at @entity273 , near @entity274			0
by the end of the @entity277 , the regiment comprised of 17 battalions			2
the regiment wore the maroon beret and the nickname ' red devils ' was bestowed by the enemy forces during fierce fighting in @entity285			2
following many famous operations during the war , the @entity8 went on to serve everywhere from @entity288 to @entity289 to the @entity290			0
more recently , the regiment led in war - torn @entity292 and @entity294			1
the regiment is made up of @entity296 , which forms the @entity297 ( @entity297 ) ; 2 para , which forms part of @entity254 and is based in @entity299 , @entity300 ; 3 @entity296 and @entity301 , the reserve parachute battalion with its headquarters in @entity304 , @entity305			1
another would - be soldier tells the cameras how he failed a selection course for the @entity309 ' by a fingernail '			2
but , three years on , he has grown tired of his everyday life			2
he said : ' i got sick to death of it			0
i want to proper money , proper mates and get a proper family about us			0
' the comradeship is also something hammered home throughout the episodes			0
corporal @entity86 said : ' once you are in the reg , you are in the reg for life , you will need no other family once you 're in here			1
' it 's hard to say , because i love my family as well and the majority of the guys will say that again , but being with the blokes - your guys , your men , your muckers - there 's no feeling like it			2
' if someone is in trouble , guys will bust a gut to help you			0
' @entity345 : earning the @entity346 is on @entity347 ( @entity348 264 , @entity349 244 , @entity350 652 ) tomorrow at 9pm .			0
