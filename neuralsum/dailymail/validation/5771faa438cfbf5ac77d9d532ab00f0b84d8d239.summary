@entity8 , 43 , captured footage of his son riding the waves for the first time on a @entity14 camera , and uploaded online			1
like a pro : the footage ends with the baby breaking out into a big smile as he rests on the board the footage shows dad and baby choosing the largest waves , and they even ended up going through the tube in the middle of the wave			1
although the youngster does seem nervous when going into the cold water , it soon changes to a smile once the board takes to the waves			2
@entity8 does not specify exactly where the video was shot but tagged it as being in @entity34			1
not impressed ... @entity8 's son looks uncomfortable as they ride into a wave the baby is visible at the height of a huge wave , bracing himself for impact , with his father propped up over him the baby looks surprised upon entry into the wave , but handles the impact well although there was some criticism over the stunt from online viewers , the dad defended the decision to take his son who he did not name into the water saying : ' my son first try			2
' i encourage you to safely bring your kids to the ocean , after all the ocean is the place where it all began			0
