many people judge themselves harshly against others			0
but scientists claim we could better learn to accept ourselves , and ultimately boost our self - confidence , with the help of a virtual reality ‘ avatar ’			2
experts say that receiving therapy in a virtual reality world , using a computer generated image of yourself , reduces self - criticism and boosts self - compassion and feels of contentment			1

the right - hand image is how the participant sees the virtual world , from a first - person perspective they think the tool could one day be used to treat a range of clinical conditions , including depression			1
a team of psychologists and computer scientists from @entity39 ( @entity39 ) , the @entity40 and @entity41 came up with the concept of a self - to - self situation using avatars and computer game technology			1
virtual reality has previously been used to treat psychological disorders including phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder , but this research focused on a new application for promoting emotional well - being			2
the study , which was published in @entity54 , examined how 43 healthy , but self - critical women , experienced the world through a life - size virtual version of themselves			1
this gave a first person perspective of a virtual room through the eyes of the avatar			0
the participants were all trained to express compassion towards a distressed virtual child while in their adult virtual body			0

in the left - hand picture a view of the participant giving her compassion intervention , seen from the child 's point of view			1
a third person view of the scenario is shown on the right as they talked to the crying child , it appeared to listen and respond positively to their words and gestures			1
after a few minutes , 22 of the participants entered the body of the virtual child so they could see their virtual body double deliver their own compassionate words and gestures to themselves			0
the remaining 21 participants observed their original virtual adult body express compassion to the child from a third person perspective			2
scientists looked at the participants ’ mood and personality traits before and after the experiment			0
professor @entity104 of @entity39 and @entity105 said : ‘ when you wear a head - mounted display and look down towards yourself and see a virtual body replacing and moving like your own and also see it in a mirror , this gives a powerful clue to the brain that this is your body			0
’ dr @entity110 , also of @entity39 , said : ‘ women who experienced a first person perspective through the eyes of the virtual child were soothed - they felt safe and content and had increased self - compassion and a lower level of self - criticism			1
scientists think that their virtual reality therapy technique could one day be used to treat a range of clinical conditions , including depression , where sufferers are often very self - critical ‘ for these women , we created a unique situation where they can have a kind and reassuring word with themselves			1
excessive self - criticism plays a prominent role in the development and persistence of many mental health problems , including depression			2
the scientists said people who are self - compassionate tend to have lower levels of self - criticism and are more able to cope with negative life events because they are more able to cultivate a positive mood			0
professor @entity139 of @entity39 , who lead the study , said the team is now conducting an in - depth clinical study to measure how long the technique ’s benefits last in both healthy and depressed people			0
‘ if positive , we hope virtual reality - based therapy will become a viable , low - cost treatment people can use in their own home - something we believe is achievable using commercial gaming technology , ’ he said			2

team of psychologists led by @entity39 developed a self - to - self situation using avatars and computer game technology to boost self - compassion
virtual reality therapy *involved* self - critical women seeing themselves as an avatar giving compassion to a crying child
some participants then saw themselves from the child 's perspective
while others saw the situation through a third - person view
experts say the computer scene could be used to treat a range of conditions , including depression , where sufferers tend to be self - critical
