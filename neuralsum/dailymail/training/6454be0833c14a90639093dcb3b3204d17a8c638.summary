hopes were high for the new @entity2 theme park aimed at @entity4 fans when it opened its doors at the start of 2015 to a media frenzy			2
but the £ 210 million theme park in east @entity4 ’s @entity11 province have so far been more than simply lack - lustre			2
the theme park centred around the iconic character invented in 1974 is described as ' cheesy ' and ' boring ' by visitors , and a long detailed review by one internet blogger brands it ' a mess '			1
not quite @entity19 : the @entity2 theme park has attracted negative reviews despite its vast costs a feature on @entity25 website @entity26 , pulls the theme park apart , with blogger @entity28 , describing it as having ' inconsistent branding , mediocre rides , and some of the most wretched food i 've encountered in seven years in @entity4			1
' the article was picked up by many on @entity35 , with @entity36 retweeting it alongside his reaction , ' report on the new @entity2 park outside of @entity41			2
in short , do n't go			0
' the theme park launched by @entity45 company @entity43 , who created @entity2 in 1974 , and entertainment design firm @entity46 , @entity47 , is in @entity48 , an area known for its rich forests and natural scenery , but clearly not for its transport links			0
@entity52 will be @entity4 's first large scale amusement park scheduled to open to the public on @entity55 people prepare a celebration to mark the completion of the construction of @entity52 the official site says a shuttle bus runs from the @entity62 to the park			0
but a reviewer on @entity65 called nehow a visit to the theme park ' an arduous trek ' , pointing out that with no railway at @entity48 , visitors must find another way of getting to the @entity48 bus terminal			1
' even getting to the bus terminal is problematic in itself			0
to get there , you must first take a bus for an hour or so from @entity80 , the closest high - speed railway stop , or from a station in @entity83 ... travelers who are flying in from other parts of @entity76 are probably looking at a minimum two - night stay in @entity4 due to logistics alone			0
' as for the food being served in the park based around the popular little white cat with the red bow , @entity28 sums up , ' worse than any train food you 'll find in @entity4 , but five times as expensive			1
' despite the fanfare for the park , positive reviews have not been forthcoming ... yet not so great ? one commenter calls the park , set in @entity48 , east @entity4 ’s @entity11 province a ' despicable project ' an anonymous commenter calls the park a ' despicable project ' , while various comments on @entity4 site @entity104 include , ' cheesy ' ' boring ' ' paint smells fill the park ' and say the prices of food and drink are ' stupidly high '			1
the @entity46 website describes the @entity52 as a ‘ a very special home - away - from home for @entity2 and all her friends			1
nestled within the green hills of @entity48 , @entity4 , @entity116 celebrates a region whose distinctive culture has grown up around the treasures of the natural world			0

@entity123 described as ' worse than any train food , but five times as expensive '
rides are called ' boring ' and ' mediocre '
@entity65 describes the journey there as an ' ardous trek '
