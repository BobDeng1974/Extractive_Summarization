last night 's highly publicised television debate between the prime minister and the leader of the opposition was intended to focus the watching audience 's attention acutely on them ahead of the general election in may			1
however , the morning after the night before , another name is grabbing the headlines			0
as @entity10 's co-host on @entity11 : the battle for @entity15 , @entity13 anchor @entity12 , 54 , was charged with managing the audience 's questions			1
@entity12 , pictured with @entity18 and @entity10 , was accused of giving the pm an easy ride narrowing her gaze at mr @entity22 : the @entity13 anchor was trending on @entity24 after the programme aired with one user , @entity27 accusing her of being ' biased ' towards @entity18 perched to left of the stage , wearing a bright pink dress , the presenter caused such a storm while interviewing @entity18 and @entity22 , that her name promptly trended on @entity24			1
@entity27 wrote : ' i 'm not sure how any sensible person can say @entity12 was neutral last night			1
i laughed a few times at how biased she was			2
' while @entity37 wrote sarcastically : ' just watched @entity12			2
really hard to see where her political loyalties lie			0
' the audience at home also derided the co-host , accusing her of giving the prime minister an easy ride , as she asked him questions about @entity45 ( in reference to leading for three terms ) and even his favourite colour			2
a spokesman for communications watchdog @entity50 said it had received 131 complaints by late morning today , all of which were about perceived bias against the @entity57 leader			0
an @entity50 spokesman said : ' we are assessing the complaints before deciding whether or not to investigate			0
' @entity61 also confirmed today that they had received around 300 complaints following the show last night although a spokeswoman could n't confirm specifically what they were about			0
@entity66 was charged with managing the audience participation section of @entity18 & @entity68 viewers at home took to @entity24 to say they felt @entity66 , 54 , was noticeably softer on the pm @entity12 has responded to many of the @entity24 responses ... surmising that both herself and @entity10 were ' alternately accused of being pro and anti both @entity18 and @entity22 ' the news anchor took to twitter herself to refute accusations of bias			1
she posted after the debate : ' i see @entity10 [ @entity10 ] and i are being alternately accused of being pro and anti both @entity18 and @entity22			1
our work here is done # @entity84			0
' later , when another user accused her of ' telling porkies ' about the reaction of viewers on @entity24 , @entity66 responded that ' @ @entity90 disagreed ' , suggesting the @entity57 team were happy with @entity66 's questioning of mr @entity22			1
a @entity61 spokeswoman said both parties had been happy with the format : ' both politicians , one of whom is likely to be the next prime minister , agreed to the format and were prepared for and actively participated in robust questioning about their policies and abilities			0
neither party has expressed any dissatisfaction to @entity61			0
' @entity66 , 54 , responded on @entity24 that the @entity22 team were ' happy ' with her performance making @entity111 cry : pop star and television presenter was reduced to tears in 2010 after @entity66 asked him about whether he worried about losing custody of his children			1
the star promptly asked for the interview to end there was an awkward moment during @entity22 's questions with the audience when @entity66 seemed to introduce an audience member as former @entity126 boy band member @entity125			1
the man 's name was actually @entity129			2
twitter users also did n't miss the opportunity to rake over @entity66 's previous tv clangers			1
the @entity134 - born @entity13 anchor has , on more than a few occasions , prompted a backlash with her questioning			1
in october 2012 , when @entity66 was dispatched to @entity138 in @entity139 to report on the disappearance of five - year - old @entity141 , she told volunteers searching for the little girl that the case had become a murder inquiry live on tv			2
the volunteers broke down at the news			0
at the time , @entity57 mp @entity149 accused @entity66 of being ' insensitive bordering on cruel '			1
complaints were filed against @entity13 in 2010 after @entity66 broke the news to two female volunteers live on camera that the disappearance of five - year - old april @entity156 was being treated as a murder enquiry the women were unaware of the latest developments in the @entity141 case and were visibly distressed as the cameras continued to roll			1
critics accused @entity66 of ' unethical journalism ' in 2010 , @entity66 commented that @entity166 vice president @entity165 's head looked bruised			1
' what 's happened to his head ? ' she asked			2
' it looks like he 's walked into a door			2
' @entity165 was actually daubed in @entity172 ash			0
in the same year , she reduced pop star and tv presenter @entity175 to tears during a live interview after asking him whether he worried about losing custody of his children			0
@entity175 , who was on the show to promote his new tour was left upset and asked for the interview to end			0
however , perhaps her most famous gaffe remains her 2001 declaration that ' the entire eastern seaboard of the @entity166 has been decimated by a terrorist attack ' as she covered the unfolding 9/11 tragedy			0
it is a moment that her critics have n't let her forget .			0
