@entity1 secretary @entity0 was in direct contact with president @entity3 at least 18 times between october 2012 and october 2013 , including seven occasions where her draft calendar showed @entity8 as the topic of conversation			1
the news appears to contradict her insistence that @entity3 was in the dark about problems plaguing the ill - fated healthcare.gov website in the months leading up to its october 1 , 2013 launch			1
@entity19 newspaper reported thursday that documents released through a @entity22 request show meetings , events and phone calls where the two were together			0
they also show at least three breakfast or lunch meetings with close @entity3 adviser @entity29 , along with scheduled calls or meetings with presidential confidante @entity32 and @entity33 chief of staff @entity34			1
throughout , @entity0 insulated the @entity52 from criticism about how the website 's expensive building and disastrous unveiling were handled			1
during an october 22 , 2013 interview on @entity59 , host @entity57 asked @entity0 whether or not @entity3 knew of the problems behind the scenes			1
' no , sir , ' she replied			0
three weeks later , @entity3 denied getting a heads - up about the online disaster that would soon come			2
' on the website , ' he said in a nov. 14 press conference , ' i was not informed directly that the website would not be working the way it was supposed to			1
had i been informed , i would n’t be going out saying , boy , this is going to be great			0
' five days later on nov. 19 , he told a @entity72 reporter during the paper 's ceo @entity73 that ' we probably underestimated the complexities of building out a website that needed to work the way it should			2
' that use of the first person pronoun ' we ' is now attracting new scrutiny			0
website visitors got error messages -- when they could reach it at all -- during october and november , greatly hampering the administration 's ability to meet its enrollment goals ' we should have anticipated that would create a rockier rollout than if @entity92 and @entity93 were both invested in success , ; he added			2
political land mine : chairman of the @entity98 @entity97 caught reporters ' spears last week after a @entity102 report found that millions of jobs would be lost because of the president 's health care law online registrations for @entity8 - linked private health insurance plans has grown to 3.3 million nationwide , according to numbers released by @entity1 on wednesday , giving the @entity33 some much - needed ammunition against critics			1
but the @entity3 administration still steadfastly refused to comment on how many @entity112 , or how few , have paid their premiums			2
a @entity115 analysis found that in five states where such statistics have been made public , just 66 per cent overall have made their first month 's payment – suggesting that 2.2 million , a smaller number , are likely insured			0
but a survey conducted by @entity121 found that just 11 per cent of people who have enrolled in private insurance through @entity8 marketplaces were uninsured before they signed up			0
that indicates that the @entity8 may have enrolled fewer than 250,000 people who did n't have insurance before			0
the @entity3 administration has said its goal is to enroll 7 million people by the end of march .			0
