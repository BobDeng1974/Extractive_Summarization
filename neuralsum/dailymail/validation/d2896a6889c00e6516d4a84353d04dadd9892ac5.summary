blaze : firefighters at the scene of a tyre fire which broke out last night between @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity2 inferno : seven fire crews have used water and foam in an effort to extinguish the enormous fire eruption : the fire has proved difficult to control because the tyres are packed tightly together and it is hard to get water to the core seven fire engines were sent to tackle the blaze , which has proved particularly tricky because the waste tyres are packed closely together making it difficult to extinguish the core of the fire			1
the @entity44 has been closed in both directions because of smoke reducing visibility in the area and this is likely to continue for most of the day , @entity43 said			2
@entity50 train services on the line to @entity52 are not running between @entity53 and @entity21 , and are not expected to restart until this afternoon			2

' flames : local residents were told not to go outside because of the risk of smoke inhalation and other injuries tricky : firefighters ended up using foam to beat back the flames , but it took longer to get to the fire burning at the core action : crews battled through the night to try and extinguish the fire on a farm dramatic : flames leapt up from the fire through the night and into the morning despite the best efforts of fire crews @entity89 of @entity90 said that crews remain at the scene attempting to put out the fire			1
' it is a large pile of tyres which have been tightly bound together at a waste storage site , ' he said early this morning			2
' because the tyres are so densely packed and tightly bound it is proving difficult to get water on to much of the fire			2
' firefighters successfully brought the flames under control with foam this morning , but they are still fighting to extinguish it completely			0
' the foam attack was successful in knocking the flames back but the fire continues to burn deep within the pile , ' mr @entity89 said			0
' we are now using water to cool the pile and protect surrounding risks			0
' we hope to get some heavy plant machinery in to start breaking the pile up later to give us better access to extinguish the fire			0
' disruption : train services in the area were shut down all morning , causing chaos for commuters travelling to @entity52 at work : firefighters next to the fire as it continued to burn this morning closed : the @entity125 was shut in both directions as a result of the danger from smoke pouring into the air @entity131 said in a statement that local residents should ' avoid outside areas affected by any smoke or ash '			1
it added : ' if people can see smoke outside their property , or can see evidence of soot particles on window sills or external surfaces , then they should stay indoors with windows and doors closed until the fire has been brought under control			1
' for anyone who already has problems with their lungs , for example asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder , it is advisable to stay inside while the fire is still burning , minimise infiltration of smoke by keeping windows and doors closed and to be sure to keep all necessary medicine with you			1
' residents who are suffering from ill health as a result of the fire should seek medical attention .			0
