the elusive and mysterious @entity0 may have a distant relative , living across the @entity2			1
dubbed @entity4 , there have been more than 600 sightings of the long , underwater sea creature in @entity8 ’s @entity7 since the 17th century - and now amateur zoologists claim to have found proof of its existence			1
using a hydrophone system , the monster hunters captured loud clicking sounds thought to have been made by the echolocation of a giant creature			1
it was captured using a hydrophone system that monitors echolocation			1
ms @entity20 claims the clicking sounds made in the recording are evidence of an underwater creature called @entity4 the audio recording was made by ' cryptozoologists ' @entity20 and @entity22 in july , near a region of the lake known as @entity34			1
ms @entity20 captured a second recording in october , but the two sound so different she is convinced the first was made by the creature known as @entity4			1
@entity7 is a freshwater lake , in @entity8 that stretches north into @entity40 , and south towards @entity41			1
the 109 - mile - long ( 175km ) lake has been called the @entity45 @entity44 because both are deep , freshwater lakes said to date back more than 10,000 years			2
the recording was made by cryptozoologists on @entity7 , @entity8			1
it was captured using a @entity51 system that monitors echolocation			1
@entity53 , or biological sonar , is used by dolphins , bats , whales and other animals			0
echolocating involves sending a call and listening to echoes to determine where various objects are around them			0
it is used for navigating and hunting and the calls are typically made using a series of clicks , as heard in the @entity4 video			2
at its deepest , @entity7 is 400 ft ( 121 metres ) - compared to @entity44 ’ 744ft ( 227 metres )			2
since 1609 , there have been more than 600 reported sightings of the creature , which became a tourist attraction during the 1970s and 1980s			1
it became so popular that a sign was erected in @entity78 listing the names of all people who claimed to have encountered the lake monster			2
many of the sightings have reported a creature with a ‘ long sinuous neck ’ and a humped body measuring between 15ft ( 4.5 metres ) to 25ft ( 7.62 metres ) long			2
ms @entity20 and mr @entity22 set up @entity87 to study , investigate and prove the existence of the monster			1
both claim to have become fascinated with the monster as children and in 1973 , @entity22 was elected president of the @entity94 of the @entity95 and tasked to write the laws that protect archaeological sites in @entity8			1
the noises were captured in july , near a region of the lake ( pictured ) known as @entity34			0
ms @entity20 captured a second recording in october , but the two sound so different she is convinced the first was made by @entity4 and the second was of a beluga whale , or similar ms @entity20 thinks believes @entity4 is a @entity106 , a dinosaur that lived 232 million years ago ( skeleton pictured at the @entity109 of @entity110 ) she said : ‘ we do n’t know if these reptiles could echolocate , it ’s one of those things that no one really knows , but something [ in the lake ] is echolocating ’ ms @entity20 believes @entity4 is a @entity106 , a dinosaur that lived 232 million years ago			1
she told @entity119 : ‘ we do n’t know if these reptiles could echolocate , it ’s one of those things that no one really knows , but something [ in the lake ] is echolocating			0
’ she added that other creatures have been discovered that were thought to have been extinct , and given the depths of the lake , this could be the case with @entity4			2
mr @entity132 has ruled out the fact that the loud clicking sound was made by a fish finder device , because the pair were alone on the lake at the time			2
@entity7 is a freshwater lake , in @entity8 that stretches north into @entity40 , and south towards @entity41 ( pictured )			1
the 109 - mile - long ( 175km ) lake has been called the @entity45 @entity44 because both are deep , freshwater lakes said to date back more than 10,000 years other theories claim the creature is plesiosaur reptile			1
but @entity146 , a professor of geology at @entity148 , @entity8 said the sightings are likely ‘ tall waves or boats ’ , while other experts have said the noises and sightings are from a sturgeon - a large fish that can grow up to 12ft ( 3.6 metres ) long ( pictured ) she also believes that the recording made in october was of a large fish , possible a beluga whale , and because the july recording was ‘ so different ’ , she has also ruled out this theory			1
