@entity0 ! although , if you celebrated @entity2 properly then you probably are n't feeling so happy right now			2
in fact , you should be feeling properly awful			2
like you never want to party or drink again ? if you are contemplating a dry january then this is actually an excellent thing : remembering this feeling of self - loathing meets severe dehydration will help you through those long , cold , sober friday nights ( there are five of them this month , people )			1
if booze is a big part of your life then taking a month 's time out from your old friend is of course a daunting task			1
i gave up drinking for a month last february ( partly to do with travelling in january and more to do with it being the shortest month of the year )			1
as a professional drinker i found it tough : lots of my work and social life is booze - if - not - bar based			1
plus , i generally love drinking and the bonhomie and fun times that accompany a night on the ale			2
but i did it ( surprising side effects included more morning sex and too many ideas to handle ) and now have lots of tips on staying sane while staying sober			2
so , with thanks too to some of my best drinking buddies , here are 11 ways to help you stay dry when you really would rather not be ... ditch your friends not forever			1
but staying on the wagon is a lot easier when you remove yourself from situations that usually include booze			1
and friends and booze tend to go together like gin and tonic ( mmmmm ...			1
if you are giving up booze for a month you might want to forget seeing friends who are n't this is the time to start screening calls , ignoring invitations and make the most of your @entity83 membership			1
@entity84 , @entity85 and what 's @entity87 will be your new @entity88 ( @entity89 )			1
do n't worry , your real friends will understand , because they will be doing the same to you			0
groom a partner in crime the exception to the rule above			0
most of us have loads of @entity99 for naughty nights , now you need some for sober time			0
if you live with someone try to get that boyfriend / brother / flat mate / wife on the sober train too			0
like a diet , it 's much easier to stay strong when you have support and a joint food or booze - free fridge			1
away from the house start doing something that does n't involve going to the pub , with one of your most fun ( and strong on willpower ) friends like movies , dog walking or spinning			0
@entity122 on the subject of diets , let 's look at this from an entirely shallow point of view and calculate the calories you are saving each time you do n't drink			1
not drinking 20 glasses of wine per week ( that 's four bottles , not unheard of in my house ) = a saving of over 28,000 calories and Â£ 350 across the month			1
stay dry , get thin ! ( @entity142 has a great calculator on their @entity145 page )			1
empty @entity146 remove temptation by throwing or hiding away all alcohol			1
a cold beer is a lot less appealing if you need to head to @entity152 in the rain to procure it			0
by forgoing wine for an entire month you could save yourself 28,000 calories stock up on nice - tasting alternatives like elderflower fizz or fruity smoothies to sate your sugar cravings			1
and serving soft drinks with ice in elegant glasses will give them a feeling of ceremony , tricking your brain into thinking of them as a treat			0
go to bed hiding away 24/7 is n't feasible , but not drinking and then thinking about not drinking can get very boring indeed , and so sometimes going to bed at 8pm is the only thing to do			0
friends on the 5:2 diet have similar issues with food on the ' 2 ' days and swear by herbal sleeping tablets and a dose of @entity181 under the duvet			0
make plans keeping busy is the best way to keep your mind off anything and having ( booze - free ) plans means that you are less likely to say yes to a quick one after work or find yourself wandering into the local off license for a browse			1
@entity191 is a website for people wanting to change their drinking habits and has loads of ideas on stuff to do if you need some inspiration			0
say no if your willpower is weaker than a @entity201 splash with too much @entity202 ( mmmmm ... ) turn down or push back any social / professional events that are n't vital			0
if ' no ' is not an option choose breakfast meetings instead of lunch / dinner			0
if it has to be a dinner fill your wine glass with sparkling water			0
it might not pass the @entity213 test darling but will help feel like you are n't being too worthy ( and also make you realise how much wine drinking at dinner is just habit )			0
if it 's a party then arrive late so that everyone 's tipsy enough not to notice you are n't really drinking ( there 's nothing duller than having to explain to slightly drunk people that you 're off the booze ) and ignore any ( usually grim ) @entity224 in favour of a soda and lime			1
become the designated driver nominating yourself as the group taxi on a night out is a brilliant way to stay dry and earn mega brownie points from your friends ( assuming you can cope with their drunk selves telling you to " turn it up , drive " from the backseat as you head home )			2
treat yourself set goals and decide on some suitable rewards for when you reach your target			0
getting to ten days , surving a big event , making it through monday without booze are all causes for a celebration i think			2
start a morning activity no booze = no hangovers = longer days			2
even a short time off the drink will mean the ' morning after ' will become the ' morning before ' and no matter how good you think you are at hangovers you will have more energy and time at the start of the day			2
how will you use it ? if you have children this is a chance to fit in some of the life laundry that never seems to get done ( or maybe just an extra hour of crucial social media stalking )			0
if you do n't , this is the perfect time to take up some kind of exercise ( also a great motivator for needing to feel fresh in the morning when the lure of the bar is extra strong )			0
for everyone , it 's a window in the diary to plan the rest of the day 's healthy living , or at least order some more @entity273 from @entity274			1
and if all else fails ... @entity275 / go to prison @entity277 , yes			0
but a straw poll of my @entity280 friends indicates that extreme measures may be needed in the battle to stay dry			2
your body will thank you for it .			0

dry january will see many of us giving up booze for an entire month
