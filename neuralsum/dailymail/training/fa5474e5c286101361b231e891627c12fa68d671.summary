by @entity0 published : 06:56 est , 6 september 2013 updated : 10:19 est , 6 september 2013 when the smoking ban was brought in six years ago , @entity1 , 48 , quickly became fed up of venturing outside for a cigarette break when she was having a drink			1
so , with the help of her late husband @entity6 , she conjured up a way of getting round the problem - by building a pub in a shed in the back garden			1
the project was their labour of love until @entity6 passed away two years ago at the age of 53 , but wife @entity16 has vowed to carry on pulling pints in his memory			1
her very own local : @entity1 pulls pints in the @entity20 , the pub she built in the back garden with her late husband @entity6 @entity23 : the @entity24 has a pool table , an arcade machine and a dart board , where @entity28 honed his skills before he died friends who visit the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 , can have a quiet pint or play the one - armed bandit or try a game of darts			1
a stocked bar , beer pumps , optics , a pool table and a gaming machine have also been installed in the shed which can hold around 60 people			2
the pub recently received a visit by international darts stars @entity48 and @entity49 through contacts with top players including @entity52 and @entity53			0
raising a glass : the pub was built in large back garden in @entity33 six years ago as a rebellion against the smoking ban cheers : the @entity24 has enough room for 60 people and has enjoyed visits from international darts players @entity48 and @entity49 @entity16 , who has a wedding and fancy dress business , said : ' @entity6 would have been in his element playing with @entity48 and @entity49 in the @entity24			1
' it was amazing to see them there			0
@entity6 would have been blown away			2
' @entity6 spent a lot of time in there honing his darts skills			0
' looking back i â€™m glad we built it and @entity6 was able to enjoy it			0
' lets play darts : @entity16 's husband @entity6 spent many years honing his skills on the @entity24 board before he passed away two - years ago at the age of 53 the couple decided to create their own pub in their large back garden six years ago as a rebellion against the smoking ban but the plan was put on ice when @entity6 fell ill on his 50th birthday			1
he was diagnosed with heart disease but they were able to start fitting out the cabin and put in tables and pub furniture			0
and when work was complete they were able to use the @entity24 on a regular basis and @entity6 , who played for a pub darts team , spent hours practising there			2
bar : the @entity24 has the equipment any customer would want in their local pub , including a selection of beer taps , bottled beer and optics			0

@entity1 , 48 , started building the @entity24 with husband @entity6
it is equipped with a dart board , a pool table and a games machine
@entity6 died two years ago but @entity16 has carried on pulling pints in his honour
