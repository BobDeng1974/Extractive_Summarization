residents have discovered anti-semitic flyers in their letterboxes which urge ' white @entity3 ' to ' wake up '			1
the flyers distributed in the @entity6 beach - side suburb of @entity7 - known for its high number of @entity10 residents - make reference to white power group @entity12			1
the letters claim ' the @entity10 ' encourage ' race mixing ' and that they ' own ' @entity15 and the majority of @entity18 media			1
ceo of the @entity21 @entity20 told @entity22 he completely condemned the posters , which were signed off by a @entity6 chapter of @entity12 , @entity25 88			0
' the flyers are an appalling compilation of racist stereotypes , which is all too predicable from neo-nazi organisations			1
it 's no coincidence that 88 represents @entity31 , which stands for @entity33			0
ceo of the @entity47 @entity20 said such anti-semitic incidents were on the rise the flyers also claimed ' jews have been kicked out of countries 109 times throughout history ... could it be that having them in a @entity58 country is harmful to the host ? '			1
when asked if he had seen similar cases in the past , mr @entity20 said he had and although these groups were known for their position on such issues incidents were on the rise			0
' there has however been a very concerning rise in anti-semitic sentiments these past months			2
' this has been evident in a large number of incidents ranging from swastikas on the streets of @entity6 to the verbal assault of children on a school bus most recently ' , he said			1
mr @entity20 was referring to an incident that took place in @entity78 at the start of this month where a group of teenagers boarded a bus full of jewish school children and terrorised them			1
' such conduct violates the values of our country and what we stand for as a multicultural society which overwhelmingly respects diversity , ' mr @entity20 continued			0
one @entity7 resident who received the letter sent it to @entity95 @entity10 newspaper @entity94 and told them he was ' disgusted ' by the discovery			1
' it is part of an increase in @entity102 that such low people as the ones who issued these flyers feel comfortable coming out of the woodwork ' , @entity98 said			2
' it is not a pleasant thought that there are some people that would like to do the worst to you for no reason other than their cruel character			0
it was the smallest touch of what it must have felt like for @entity10 in @entity58 before @entity119			1
' there , there was no hope and no support , at least now in @entity3 it is reasonable to believe that most decent people will find this type of leaflet appalling , ' mr @entity98 continued			1
@entity3 race discrimination commissioner dr @entity128 tweeted that he was ' very disturbed ' by the flyers @entity3 race discrimination commissioner dr @entity128 told @entity22 via a statement that extremely racist messages such as the flyer have no place in @entity3 and the @entity10 community has his full support			1
' we should be very concerned to see such anti-semitic material being circulated in @entity6			2
it is a worrying sign that extremists are being emboldened to spread their messages of racial hatred			0
@entity12 is a website associated with neo-nazi organisations and with the advocacy of racist doctrines			0
' ideas about racial hatred or purity simply have no place in @entity3 society			1
those responsible for this material should be condemned			0
' the letter was signed off by @entity25 which is a @entity6 offshoot of neo-nazi group @entity12 , whose logo is pictured here ' members of the @entity3 jewish community have communicated to me their concern about rising anti-semitism			2
the @entity10 community has my full support in combating prejudice and discrimination			2
there needs to be an unambiguous message from all levels of society about racism			0
' where there is n't , extremists can start to believe that they may have licence to express their racial hatred			0
we ca nâ€™t be complacent			0
when it is given the opportunity , racial vilification can escalate to racial violence , ' the statement finished			0
also accusing @entity10 people of pumping ' anti @entity58 values ' and ' drug abuse ' , the flyer invited people ' with an open mind ' to join them			2
on @entity190 's facebook page just over a week ago there was a call out for members who could help hand out leaflets around their suburb so long as the distributed a ' minimum of 500 '			0
federal mp for @entity198 , @entity196 said on his website that those responsible for the leaflets were guilty of ' un-australian behaviour '			0
' these leaflets seek to undermine the security and the harmony of @entity3 and hence of all @entity3 , ' he said .			1

anti-semitic flyers have been delivered to @entity7 and @entity206
the leaflets read ' wake up white @entity3 ' and accuse ' the @entity10 ' of encouraging ' race mixing '
head of the @entity212 called them ' appalling '
earlier this month @entity10 children were terrorised on their school bus
