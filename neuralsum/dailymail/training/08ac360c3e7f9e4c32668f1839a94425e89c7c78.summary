it took 36 minutes for the first email to arrive			0
as the shockwaves from @entity4 were still reverberating , bookmakers began pumping out their blunt messages			0
assessing how much of an impact @entity11 's suspension would have on @entity13 's ambitions for the new @entity15 campaign , the words in the subject box from odds compilers had no ambiguity			1
' @entity18 pushed out for title glory , ' they proclaimed			2
they were delivering a calculated summary of where @entity13 stand without @entity11 : not credible contenders			2
when it has been put to him in the past that his side were over-reliant on @entity11 , he could list statistics and highlights to show why it was n't just about this maverick soul from @entity40			2
he had a point , too			0
when @entity11 served a 10 - match ban for biting @entity44 's @entity43 in april 2013 , @entity13 won seven times in all competitions , drew two and lost one			1
they were not short of goals , either , particularly from @entity48			0
the reality , however , is different			0
his presence scrambles the minds of opponents , inspires those around him and last season he gave supporters that priceless belief that , no matter what , he would score and @entity13 would win			0
do not underestimate his worth			0
happy days : @entity11 celebrates winning the golden boot with his daughter @entity59 and wife @entity61 as it stands now , @entity11 will miss the first nine @entity15 matches and in the corresponding fixtures last year , his influence was enough to secure @entity30 10 extra points - the difference , effectively , between finishing second and fourth			1
@entity11 brings out the best in @entity13 but what is best for @entity13 now should not include @entity11			2
that might sound contradictory , given what his 31 goals helped achieve in 2013 - 14 , but if he remains on @entity72 while serving his ban , he will cast a heavy , uncomfortable cloud			1
shame : the @entity77 forward has been banned for four months after biting @entity24 at the @entity78 say he is still a @entity13 player in october			0
with some tricky assignments - such as trips to @entity82 and @entity83 , as well as the @entity72 derby - @entity13 could find themselves outside the top four , particularly if their @entity85 schedule is complicated			1
questions to @entity30 then become about whether @entity13 can keep a player of his ability if they are not challenging for the honours he craves			2
missing out : @entity11 narrowly missed out on the title last season and could now be on his way to @entity93 put simply , @entity30 does n't need it any more			1
the topic dominated last summer when @entity11 was trying to engineer a move to @entity97 and @entity11 's future was fast becoming an issue once more this month before his notoriety in @entity101			1
@entity30 is trying to build @entity13 up into a position where they will not be one - season wonders ; he wants the verve and the style and the winning sprees of last season 's efforts to become normal			1
having @entity11 would obviously enhance their prospects but @entity11 keeps letting @entity30 down			1
tough times : @entity13 boss @entity30 has been let down by @entity11 @entity111 hands @entity13 problem @entity13 did everything they could to help @entity11 last season , from letting him bring his newborn son , @entity115 , on to the pitch before a game last october to making him captain in @entity119 's absence and ensuring dr @entity121 ' counsel was available to him at all times			1
in the main , it worked , but these latest events show he can not be trusted			0
as @entity127 said in @entity128 on thursday , controversy will be just around the corner , waiting to trip @entity13 up - so now is the time for ruthlessness			0
if @entity30 is going to create a title - winning team , he needs reliability and stability as well as talent			1
he is not afraid to make big decisions - one of his first acts as @entity13 manager was to send Â£ 35million @entity140 out to @entity141 on loan - but the biggest is looming			0
challenge : @entity30 showed with @entity140 that he is willing to make big decisions privately @entity30 may feel @entity11 has reached the point where he causes more harm than good			1
if that is the case , a deal with @entity93 - who have not been put off by events in @entity149 - should be done and the money used to make @entity13 stronger			0
should he be able to do that , life without @entity11 need not be as bleak as the bookmakers forecast .			2

as it stands now , @entity11 will miss the first nine @entity15 matches of next season
if the *striker* remains on @entity72 while serving his four - month ban , he will cast a heavy cloud
@entity30 needs reliability and stability as well as talent to create title - winning team
