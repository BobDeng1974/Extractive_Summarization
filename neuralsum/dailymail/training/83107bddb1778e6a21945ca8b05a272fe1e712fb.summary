read @entity1 's full statement here @entity3 's future at adidas @entity3 's incredible 39 games banned for his three bites on opposition @entity3 found himself an outcast from world football on thursday after being handed a four - month ban from the game			1
the @entity13 and @entity14 striker , who bit @entity16 ’s @entity15 on the shoulder during his country ’s @entity19 victory on tuesday , flew back to @entity21 in disgrace last night after being told his @entity19 was over following an unprecedented @entity1 punishment			1
@entity3 was evicted from @entity14 ’s team hotel on thursday as part of his immediate four - month ban , which will see him miss the opening 13 games for @entity13 next season as well as the next nine competitive @entity31 internationals			1
but there is no chance of @entity3 appearing at @entity82 2014 again and his future at @entity13 is also plunged into uncertainty through the length of the suspension			1
@entity1 ’s strict regulations barring him from any involvement in football mean he can not even watch @entity13 or @entity14 in action — he is banned from football stadiums and must train alone away from @entity13 ’s @entity93 training ground			1
@entity3 can be sold during his spell in football exile — a strong possibility — but can not personally join in negotiations in mooted moves to @entity99 or @entity100			2
@entity13 are taking specialist legal advice before deciding what to do about @entity3 — a world - class footballer who comes with more baggage than any other elite star			1
given the length of his ban , @entity13 , who have not been contacted by @entity1 or the @entity14 @entity108 , feel aggrieved to be punished for something in which they had no part			1
the news was greeted with dismay by the club ’s owners in @entity116			0
ouch : @entity15 attempts to show the bite marks to referee @entity118 bite night ! @entity3 holds his teeth after the biting incident during the @entity19 against @entity15 not fooling anyone : @entity3 holds his teeth after sinking them into the shoulder of @entity15 @entity14 @entity108 president @entity124 said : ‘ we are preparing our appeal to present to @entity1 in the next few hours			1
it ’s an extremely excessive punishment , there was not enough evidence and i have seen more aggressive incidents			0
it feels like @entity14 have been thrown out of the @entity19			2
we all know what @entity3 means to @entity14 and to football around the world			2
@entity3 will travel home to recover with his family			2
’ following this third , high - profile biting incident , it is no surprise that @entity3 ’s major sponsor adidas are thinking of ditching him			2
he has already been punished for racially abusing @entity142 and biting @entity143			0
a statement said : ‘ @entity145 does not condone @entity3 ’s recent behaviour and we will again be reminding him of the high standards we expect from our players			2
we have no plan to use @entity3 for any additional marketing activities during the @entity19			0
we will discuss all aspects of our future partnership directly with @entity3 and his team after the tournament			0
’ another of @entity3 ’s backers , 888poker , are likely to drop him , with a spokesman saying : ‘ 888poker is seriously reviewing its relationship with the player as we will not tolerate unsporting behaviour			0
’ on message : tube commuters found out about the lengthy ban given to @entity3 on the digital screen on the ball : the news broke just before the busy evening rush hour going digital : @entity3 will miss key @entity172 fixtures against some @entity174 clubs breaking news : the screens show train arrival times for the @entity178 @entity179 : the digital boards are rarely used for news announcements jaws : a @entity184 fan pretends @entity3 is biting him as he poses for a photograph next to an advert @entity187 hands @entity13 problem the independent @entity1 disciplinary committee , chaired by @entity190 of @entity191 , reached the decision to hand @entity3 a @entity19 record ban after 10 hours of talks spread over wednesday night and thursday morning before it was announced at @entity1 ’s daily briefing at the @entity196			1
the player and the @entity14 @entity108 had been informed minutes beforehand			1
the suspension starts with immediate effect			0
the committee took into account that this was the third time @entity3 had bitten an opponent			0
his first victim was @entity206 ’s @entity205 in 2010 , for which he received a seven - match ban , and then @entity208 ’s @entity143 in 2013 , which brought a 10 - game ban			0
@entity190 said : ‘ such behaviour can not be tolerated and in particular not at a @entity19 when the eyes of millions are on the stars on the field			0
the disciplinary committee took into account all the factors of the case and the degree of mr @entity3 ’s guilt in accordance with the relevant provisions of the code			0
’ the @entity31 media claimed that @entity190 ’s committee had come under pressure from @entity229 chiefs , including the @entity232 - hating @entity231 football president @entity230 , not to punish @entity3 too severely			1

now let ’s see how we can help this human being and whether the group can show its class and its love for @entity14			0
’ @entity269 ’s @entity1 vice-president @entity268 said : ‘ the punishment is fully justified			0
