a protester has been banned from all @entity2 and @entity3 flights after staging a protest to stop the deportation of a @entity7 asylum seeker on her flight			1
@entity10 received an email from @entity2 condemning the political statement and saying her ' actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the @entity2 or the @entity3 '			2
ms @entity10 boarded the plane objecting to the transfer and deportation of @entity17 , a 25 - year - old refugee , who she believed would face persecution upon arriving back in @entity19			1
upon boarding the flight ms @entity10 refused to take her seat until @entity17 was taken off the plane and returned to the @entity31			1
ms @entity10 says she learnt of her ban after reading an article published by @entity34 last tuesday			2
@entity10 discovered she was banned from @entity2 flights after reading an article in the age standing by her convictions : ms @entity10 makes a speech during the @entity40 ' i tried to follow up on the ban but there was no number for me to call			1
when i called @entity2 headquarters they sent me to customer service who told me to fill out a form if i had a complaint about the ban , ' ms @entity10 said , adding that she is seeking legal advice			1
' communication at @entity2 needs to be fixed up			0
' ms @entity10 is not alone as two other passengers also received ban notices after deciding they would boycott the flight			1
@entity58 , 51 , and his female colleague were not involved in the protest but said they felt ' uncomfortable ' upon learning of @entity17 's deportation			1
mr @entity58 said he and a colleague felt faced with a ' moral dilemma			0
' after his female colleague decided she was not comfortable being on the plane mr @entity58 also decided not to fly			0
' we could n't have been politer			0
we were travelling for business , we 've both got executive roles in the organisation we work for … we were not aggravating or inciting other people , ' mr @entity58 told @entity74			0
when he and his colleague were back inside the airport the federal police took their details but no one from @entity2 informed them at that point of any kind of ban			0
ms @entity82 , mr @entity58 and his colleague have also been banned from flying with @entity3 and @entity2 affiliates flyers were handed out at @entity31 airport asking the public to save asylum seeker @entity17 from torture it was n't until mr @entity58 was returning from @entity91 four days later after catching a flight with a different airline that he attempted to return to @entity31 with @entity2 and was told he was subject to a no - fly ban			1
' as a result of your actions on board @entity99 from @entity100 on 2nd february , we have decided to issue you a no fly notification - until further notice while the incident is investigated , ' @entity2 wrote			2
' i still did n't hear anything by monday and the only response i got was to submit a customer care complaint , ' he added			0
after mr @entity58 submitted his complaint he then received a formal letter on february 16 informing him of his ban			2
@entity58 was issued with this ' no fly notification ' after he walked off a flight from @entity31 to @entity91 which was carrying an asylum seeker thought to have been taken for deportation while ms @entity10 was dissatisfied by the way @entity2 communicated the ban to her , she said it was not right for the other two passengers , who were not part of the protest , to also face a ban mr @entity58 has since complained to the @entity124 's human rights division saying the ban discriminates against him on the basis of his political belief			1
' if alternatively there was no asylum seeker on the plane and i decided to accompany my colleague off the plane because she was ill i do n't think i 'd be banned			2
' so the only reason i can see for this ban is my political beliefs … i 'm not a known activist , i never have been			0
i 'm in my fifties , i 'm not a radical			0
' his female colleague is also filing a complaint			0
a @entity2 spokesperson told @entity74 that the passengers will remain on a no fly list until the incident has been investigated by the @entity146			2
' as the incident is under investigation , it is not appropriate to comment further			0
' ms @entity10 says it is unfair that the other two passengers , who were not part of the protest , also received bans			1
