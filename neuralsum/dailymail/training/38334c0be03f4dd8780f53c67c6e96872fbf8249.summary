these pictures show cows clashing at the grand final of @entity6 's ' @entity12 ' ( ' @entity13 ' ) competition in @entity15 , in the western @entity16			1
unlike bullfighting - where humans fight bulls , often to the death - the @entity6 spectator sport pitches cows against each other in a bovine battle for supremacy			1
locking horns : two cows fight during the @entity27 ' , in @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity6 although the formally organised events began less than 100 years ago , cow fighting is said to be an ancient tradition in @entity6			1
the fighting cows are drawn from the feisty @entity34 breed , common in @entity16 , which are robust and possess the singular characteristic of fighting among themselves for supremacy within the herd			2
comparatively small - bodied , brown and black - coated and with curved white horns , the cows are these days bred specially for combat , rather than milk or meat			2
their horns are blunted before competition , so the fights are mainly a contest of pushing and shoving , with losers determined by the first cow to back down			1
it 's the @entity53 : thousands of spectators look on as @entity55 and @entity56 duke it out in the arena the fighting cows , always females , are drawn from the feisty and robust @entity34 breed , common in @entity16 still , despite their competitive instinct , it can sometimes be difficult to provoke the usually placid cows into combat			1
once in the arena , they often need prodding , and even then they are sometimes more interested in chewing the cud or exploring the daisies			0
if a cow refuses to fight , she is eliminated			0
but other times all the cows will fight at once , in a cacophony of mooing , stamping and locking horns			2
however , unlike the notorious @entity3 equivalent , blood is rarely spilt			1
despite their competitive instinct , it can sometimes be difficult to provoke the usually placid cows into combat winners are awarded special cowbells and are crowned ' @entity86 ' and the winner of the grand final dubbed ' @entity86 of queens '			0
it 's a coveted prize ; the pinnacle of a breeder 's career			0
the achievement will not only earn them local fame , but also secure a bumper fee of up to ten times the going rate for any calf born to the winning cow			0
but despite the plaudits , and cash , up for grabs , breeders admit its not really possible to train the cows how to fight			0
all they can do is feed the animals and make sure they stay in good shape			0
' the rest is up to the cows - fighting is in their blood			1
they love it , ' says one .			0

cow fighting is a @entity6 tradition , but arranged fights began last century
the cows have their horns blunted before they are led into the arena
unlike @entity3 bullfighting , blood is rarely spilt in @entity6 cow fights
the owner of the winner can command huge sums for her calves
