the killing of @entity19 in @entity141 on friday came as government representatives prepared to meet the militants with a view to opening peace talks			2
it drew an angry response from @entity155 , with interior minister @entity156 accusing @entity157 of sabotaging peace efforts			0
prime minister @entity49 was more measured , but said his government was committed to seeking peace through dialogue and stressing that an end to bloodshed could not be achieved ' by unleashing senseless force '			0

following treatment she gradually regained her sight and voice			0

she has since received multiple awards including the prestigious @entity215 for free speech , which is awarded by the @entity217 annually in memory of @entity220 physicist and dissident @entity221			0
previous winners include @entity224 's @entity223 and @entity226 's @entity225			0
no clear progress had been made in peace negotiations before the strike on @entity19 , and @entity71 dismissed the whole process as a sham			1
' all the drama in the name of peace talks was staged to please @entity14 : on one side government wanted to talk to us and on the other side was talking to the @entity14 in @entity157 , ' @entity71 said			2
' we will not talk to the @entity5 government until it announces the complete enforcement of sharia			0
' retired brigadier @entity241 , a former security chief for the tribal areas , said @entity15 's appointment had ' completely changed dynamics of the @entity5 @entity4 '			1
