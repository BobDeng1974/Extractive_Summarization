by @entity0 published : 02:27 est , 25 july 2012 updated : 03:44 est , 25 july 2012 celebrity chef @entity1 has criticised sports stars @entity2 and @entity4 for promoting junk food			1
the television presenter , who forced the government to introduce nutrition rules in schools after highlighting the unhealthy meals served to pupils , has added his name to a letter which condemns the use of athletes in commercials			2
@entity1 and other signatories , including dr @entity18 , the president of the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , say the practice sends the wrong message to children			1
under fire : @entity2 , pictured swigging from a fizzy drink bottle in an advert for @entity26 , has been criticised for promoting the product the letter , published in the @entity29 , reads : ' on the eve of the @entity37 we , a group with a vested interest in improving the health and wellbeing of young people , express our grave concern about this trend			1
' we believe it is wrong for athletes to encourage the excessive consumption of such items , which are fuelling poor health and obesity			2
image rights : @entity2 has signed lucrative contracts to endorse soft drink @entity26 ' @entity2 is a great sportsman , yet he has endorsed @entity26			1
' what about the impact of @entity4 ’s association with @entity53 crisps ? or the partnership between @entity55 and the @entity56 ? ' the letter claims that food companies are aware their products have ' little redeeming nutritional qualities ' but can trigger a ' so - called " halo " effect ' by associating them with sport			1
it warns that diet - related diseases are reaching global epidemic proportions			0
the letter continues : ' with one in three children in @entity71 overweight or obese by the age of nine , we have a public health crisis that requires urgent intervention			2
' it ends : ' we would ask athletes to be very conscious of the effect their endorsements may have on the future lives of youngsters			0
' obesity does not just carry physical consequences but serious social and emotional ones as well			0
' other signatories to the letter are @entity19 past president professor @entity87 , @entity89 president @entity88 , @entity91 director @entity90 and @entity93 cardiologist dr @entity92			1
dr @entity92 , who has called for a ban on junk food sponsorship of the @entity37 , said : ' it is totally perverse that some of the main sponsors of the greatest sporting spectacle in the world are @entity102 ’s and @entity103			0
' one vital step in reducing the consumption of obesogenic products is to end the association of sporting role models with junk food			0
promotion : former @entity111 striker @entity4 has appeared alongside ex-managers @entity112 and @entity114 ( left ) and singer @entity115 ( right ) in adverts for @entity53 crisps ' the very lucrative financial gain for these athletes is sadly at the expense of our children ’s health and we should not allow this to continue			1
' dr @entity125 said : ' we should n’t underestimate the fascination that many children and young people have with celebrities , whether that ’s teenage girls skipping meals to look like the latest airbrushed magazine model or boys wanting the same brand boot as their footballing idol			2
' sporting role models in particular can send a powerful message to children when it comes to their health and fitness			0
' instead of glamorising junk food , they should be using their influence to inspire children and young people to become tomorrow ’s top athletes by eating well and leading active lifestyles			0
critical : tv chef @entity1 has signed a letter criticising the use of athletes to promote foods with ' little redeeming nutritional qualities ' ' with celebrity status comes responsibility			1
so rather than helping to fuel this nation ’s growing obesity crisis , these stars can play a key role in helping stem it			0
' mr @entity88 said : ' like many colleagues in the teaching profession and beyond i continue to be frustrated by the direct link made by large numbers of young people between the sports men and women idolised by so many and the promotion of unhealthy food and drink			0
' this sends entirely the wrong message to a generation who are often influenced by the advertising of these products by their heroes			1
' i would ask those involved to reflect carefully on the potential consequences of their actions and instead work together to help to improve the health and life chances of those who are so vulnerable			0
