by @entity0 published : 16:33 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 16:34 est , 28 march 2013 a @entity2 photographer has become more involved in his art by drawing himself into his pictures			2
@entity5 uses a ' dodge and burn ' effect to create brush strokes that make his photographs look more like a painting			1
he does this to make his artwork ' more pleasant to the eye ' and to introduce an imaginative element to photography			2
@entity5 combined his two passions of drawing and photography to make an eye - catching form of art the artists wanted to create something a little out of the ordinary when he used photography techniques in a painterly style @entity5 , 32 , said : ' drawing has always been my passion , but after discovering photography , i thought the combination of my two passions would allow me to do something a little out of the ordinary			1
' the pictures are very personal and give free rein to my imagination			0
' the graphic designer , from @entity2 , has created two series of his work			0
the first , titled ' the sketch of life ' illustrates @entity5 's life with the intervention of people who are close to him or events that have been important to him , with something a little more humorous			1
the second , named ' @entity46 ' sees @entity5 work with a team of people , named ' @entity49 ' contains a number of portraits from his photography team , where he shows the process of some of his images			1
@entity5 enjoys bringing life to his art through the combination of drawing and photography the unique use of line brings a comic - book element to his photographs @entity5 included the people who meant the most to him in his series of photographs , including both family and friends the drawing is done by hand on a sheet of paper , scanned and cleaned , before being added to the photo using @entity74 ' i have included people who are important to me , such as my grandmother who taught me to draw , ' said @entity5			1
' but i have also included a couple of humorous images such as the ' sketch and fight ' picture which shows the battle of two artists - myself and my friend @entity86 ' - each with our own technique			0
' @entity5 created the pictures in his apartment , using a @entity91 , a 50mm and simple lighting			1
the drawing is done by hand on a sheet of paper , scanned and cleaned , before being added to the photo using @entity74			1
from the shooting to the final image , it can take @entity5 a few hours to several days to complete			2
' i find it 's good to take a break when i 'm creating these images , ' he said			0
' it suddenly brings a new look , and i can find mistakes that i did n't necessarily notice before			0
the trickiest part of these images is the presence of the sketch in the photo as it has to look realistic and balanced the images are complicated to create and it can take up to a few days to complete just one piece @entity5 aims to utilise the best elements of paint and photography to create a whole new level of portraiture ' the trickiest part of these images is the presence of the sketch in the photo as it has to look realistic and balanced			1
' you can show ' enough ' but not too much either			0
it also requires the position of the drawings matched with the placement of the pencil on the picture , to bring some life			0
' @entity5 takes his inspiration from artist @entity131			2
he said : ' i 've always been a huge fan of his work , which is associated with drawing and photography			2
' unlike mine , his universe is rather imaginary			0
' in my series , i try to present things in a realistic way , as if my sketches have given birth to reality			0
