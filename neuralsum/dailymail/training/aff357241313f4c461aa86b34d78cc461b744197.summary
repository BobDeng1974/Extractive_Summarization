by @entity0 if a picture is worth a thousand words , than a picture taken with a gigapixel camera must be worth millions			1
scientists at @entity6 have built an astonishing prototype camera that , not unlike many smartphones , allows the viewer to zoom in and focus on certain aspects of the photograph – all while maintaining incredible clarity			1
the experimental camera takes shots containing up to 50 gigapixels of data – or 50,000 megapixels			1
while most point - and - shoot cameras come equipped with around 10 - 16 megapixels , the scope is truly dizzying			2
scroll down for more high - resolution images @entity6 scientists combined 98 individual cameras to create the aware - 2 , which allow the camera to have a resolution five times better than the so - called perfect 20/20 vision in humans			1
the result is a picture that is comprised of billions of pixels , which are single points in an image that together converge into recognisable images			2
even the best professional cameras on the market only top 20 - 30 megapixels			2
described in an article appearing in @entity41 , the pictures show wide - angle shots of various locations , and how the gigapixel camera allows for tight and precise views of objects relatively far away			1
the camera uses a spherical lens to capture every iota of detail in its range , mounted with nearly 100 14 - megapixel microcameras			2
because of the nature of the lens , it has a view of 120 degrees by 50 degrees			0
the lens actually takes 100 individual pictures , which are then pieced together by a computer			2
electrical engineer @entity62 told @entity41 , which published his team ’s findings : ‘ scanning a scene with these cameras , you can see a lot more than if you were actually there			0
’ in one wide - angle shot of the @entity71 skyline , various buildings can be seen , with the traffic moving at a decent pace			0
but with the gigapixel camera , suddenly a truck can be seen driving down one of the streets blocks away , and the ‘ in ’ and ‘ out ’ signs on a parking garage a half - mile away can clearly be read			1
dr @entity62 added that taking a picture with a traditional camera , such as a point - and - shoot , is like ‘ looking through a soda straw since you can only see a narrow part of the scene			2
’ but he compares the prototype camera to a fire house , saying : ‘ the world comes at you full ( blast			1
) ’ the camera uses a spherical lens to capture every iota of detail in its range , mounted with 96 14 - megapixel microcameras			0
because of the nature of the lens , it has a view of 120 degrees by 50 degrees			0
the lens actually takes 100 individual pictures , which are then pieced together by a computer , @entity41 said			0
but , the scientists note that the @entity104 is far from the commercial market , as it is still too cumbersome and requires space for its various electronic boards			1
not to mention its sizable weight – around 100 pounds – and its bulk			0
it takes about 18 seconds to shoot a photograph ( not unlike the old daguerreotype ) as the camera takes in all the data			0
the result is stunning ; the slightest details – like licence plates and street signs – can be perfectly read from a picture taken a half - mile away			1
the aware - 2 can only currently produce pictures in black and white , though researchers at the @entity123 school are looking to build a colour gigapixel camera soon			1
their research was supported by @entity126 , the @entity126			0
@entity127 , who is a professor at @entity6 ’s @entity128 , as well as other scientists from the @entity130 and the @entity131 – @entity132 participated in the ground - breaking research			1
dr @entity62 hopes that once the technology catches up to the concept , gigapixel cameras could replace their megapixel cousins			0
‘ as more efficient and compact electronics are developed , ’ he said			0
' the age of hand - held gigapixel photography should follow			0
’ shutter to think : scientists at @entity6 created the massive lens , which uses nearly 100 microcameras to capture individual images which are then reassembled			1

prototype camera developed by @entity6 scientists captures images up to 50,000 megapixels
pictures of street signs a half mile away can clearly be read with new technology
while camera is cumbersome , scientists say gigapixels are the *future* of *digital* photography
