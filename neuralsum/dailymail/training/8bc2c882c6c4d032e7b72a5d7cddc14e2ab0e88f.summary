@entity0 knocked @entity2 icon @entity1 off his perch on saturday with a brilliant performance to win the men 's 400m individual medley			1
but just minutes later , in the women 's version of the event , a 16 - year - old @entity8 prodigy performed an even more amazing feat as she smashed the world record and left her competitors far behind			1
@entity15 posted such a good time that her final 50m was in fact faster than @entity0 's performance in the men 's event , at just 28.93 seconds			1
her achievement was so unprecedented that it even led some broadcasters to question whether @entity15 had benefited from underhand practices			2
record breaker : @entity15 knocked five seconds off her personal best and broke the world record by more than a second as she stormed to gold in the 400m individual medley in the @entity30 beaten : @entity0 , pictured , was slower than @entity15 over the last 50 metres of his own medley race @entity33 presenter @entity32 asked former @entity35 olympian @entity34 , who was in the studio as a pundit : ‘ how many questions will there be , @entity34 , about somebody who can suddenly swim so much faster than she has ever swum before ? ’ @entity8 swimming has previously been tainted by drug scandals – another 16 - year - old world champion tested positive for doping last month – but @entity34 sought to play down any suggestion of cheating			1
he said : ‘ it was a five - second best time and it was the way she did it as well			0
bearing in mind she is 16 years of age , and when you are young you do some big best times … it can be done			0
’ miss @entity32 ’s question provoked a storm among @entity33 viewers on @entity58 , with many praising her for daring to even hint at the possibility of cheating , but many criticising her for tainting the @entity8 swimmer ’s achievement and some even calling for her sacking			1
@ aliwillson was outraged at @entity66 's query , and said : ' @entity15 sets world record and @entity32 immediate intimates she doping			1
who the hell does she think she is ? ! # @entity33 pls fire her asap ' whereas @entity72 felt that @entity32 not questioning other record breakers ' success in years gone by was unfair			0
but others applauded her for simply questioning how miss @entity15 was able to record such an impressive time , and beat the world record by such a margin			1
@entity80 's cricket pundit and presenter @entity79 was among them			2
‏ @ @entity82 simply said : ' @entity32 a brilliant broadcaster ' angered : some users took to @entity58 , with @ aliwillson even calling for @entity66 's sacking unfair : this user believes miss @entity32 was wrong to broach the subject in miss @entity15 's case defence : others , including @entity79 , hailed the broadcaster for her comments @entity15 's total time was 4:28.43 , a world record which was three seconds ahead of her closest rival and five seconds quicker than her own personal best			1
while @entity0 , 27 , was 23 seconds faster than @entity15 overall , he took 29.10 seconds to complete the final 50m freestyle lap of the race , 0.17 seconds slower than the @entity8 teenager			1
the @entity103 star said he admired @entity15 's achievement , and even suggested that she might be able to beat him in a head - to - head race			1
' we were all talking about it last night at dinner , it is pretty impressive , ' @entity0 said on sunday			2
' she 's fast , if she was there with me , maybe she would have beaten me			0
' @entity15 herself was humble in response to her record - breaking swim , and put it down to the quality of her coaching			2
medal winners : @entity15 shows off the gold alongside the @entity103 ' @entity121 , left , and compatriot @entity122 following the final proud : @entity15 attributes her success to the training she has received since being identified as a potential champion ' i think it is because i have had very good training recently , which is why i got this result , ' she said			1
' i am so excited , this is like something out of a dream			0
before the final i did n't sleep so well , but it did n't effect my performance , i have trained hard			0
' the champion added : ' i am very young and i am sure i will just get better			0
' last night the @entity33 defended miss @entity32 ’s comments , insisting : ‘ the @entity8 swimmer had just knocked five seconds off her personal best to break a world record ; in her role as a presenter it is @entity32 ’s job to ask the experts ( in this case @entity34 ) , how she managed to do it			1
there was absolutely no implication of doping			0
’ the success of @entity8 , which won more gold medals in the pool on the first day than it did in the whole of its own @entity30 in @entity156 four years ago – prompted further questions , with some fearing @entity8 ’s sudden resurgence is a throwback to days of the 1994 @entity161 world championships , when its drug - powered women swept to 13 of the 16 available golds			2
questions : appearing alongside former @entity35 olympian @entity34 , @entity33 commentator @entity32 questioned whether @entity15 had benefited from underhand practices publicity : @entity15 's achievement is sure to catapult her into the top rank of @entity8 sports stars in june @entity8 state media said 16 - year - old @entity172 , part of the country ’s winning team at the @entity176 , had tested positive for a performance - enhancing drug , @entity177 , which boosts the body ’s oxygen supplies			1
the @entity8 , who point out that their athletes are regularly tested , have gone to great lengths to ensure there is no chance of any of their athletes failing dope tests in @entity188 and are said to have even imposed a ban on them eating the food prepared at the @entity192			2
miss @entity15 began her illustrious career when she was plucked from a primary school classroom			2
teachers in @entity8 are trained to look out for pupils with promising physical attributes and noticing the seven - year - old had unusually large hands and long legs , her teacher alerted the local government sports officials			0
she left home to begin an intensive training regime at one of @entity8 ’s 3,000 - plus state - run and funded ‘ medal factories ’ , designed to transform talented youths into ruthless sporting machines			0
congratulations : @entity15 hugs @entity122 after her victory at the @entity213 at the @entity214 sensation : @entity15 managed to swim the final 50m length in the race in a time of 28.93 , a time that was quicker than the men 's champion @entity0 disappointed : @entity0 shakes hand with @entity1 after they won silver in the 4x100m relay aged just 12 , she was selected for the national team			1
she took her trainers by surprise at the @entity176 in @entity230 last year , producing a devastating freestyle triumph in the 200m individual medley			0
her trajectory caught @entity235 propagandists by surprise , but they have since given her the kind of profile usually afforded to more established stars			0
‘ her career has been rocket - like			0
she ’s one of the other great discoveries following the @entity246 , ’ the @entity235 ’s newspaper of choice , the @entity241 , declared .			0

@entity8 swimmer @entity15 smashed world record by a second and her own personal best by five
last 50m was *slightly* faster than men 's gold medallist @entity0
@entity103 star hails teen 's ' impressive ' achievement and says she could beat him
but @entity35 presenter *controversially* suggests win could be down to doping
