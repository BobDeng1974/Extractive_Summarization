the finding may also help explain why children born after fertility treatment are more likely to have developmental difficulties			1
it is well known that children conceived as a result of fertility treatment are at a higher risk of premature birth and low birth weight			2
but evidence is now emerging that poor fertility plays a critical role , rather than @entity24 , say @entity26 researchers			1
they assessed the neurological development of 209 children at the age of two - all of whom were born to parents who had struggled to conceive , and most of whom had had fertility treatment			2
impaired fertility is defined as failing to become pregnant after 12 months			2
the researchers found mild neurological problems affected 17 of the children - just under eight per cent - and were significantly more common among those whose parents had taken longer to conceive			1
taking longer to become pregnant led to a 30 per cent increased risk of giving birth to a child with mild neurodevelopmental problems			1
the researchers assessed movement , posture and muscle tone , reflexes , and eye - hand coordination in the children , and took into account the parents ’ ages			0
the time taken to get pregnant among their parents averaged just over four years , but ranged from 1.6 to just over 13 years			0
evidence is now emerging that poor fertility plays a critical role in development parents whose children did not have these problems took an average of two years and 8 months to conceive , but ranging from one month to 13 years			1
the study was published online in the @entity64 of @entity65			0
lead author professor @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , said : ‘ in conclusion , the present data suggest that increased time to pregnancy is associated with suboptimal neurological development			0
‘ this implies that factors associated with subfertility may play a role in the genesis of neurodevelopmental problems			0
’ further research will be needed before couples can be given advice based on this finding , she said .			0
