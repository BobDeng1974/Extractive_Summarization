@entity1 manager @entity0 admits they can not afford to give out - of - form striker @entity3 a much - needed rest			1
the @entity5 international has scored just twice since he moved to @entity7 from @entity8 on a permanent £ 28million deal in the summer			1
at this stage 12 months ago he had twice as many goals while playing on loan for the @entity1 , but @entity0 believes last season 's exertions followed immediately by the @entity15 have taken their toll on the 21 - year - old			1
@entity3 has struggled for form since joining @entity1 from @entity8 this summer in a £ 28million move however , with @entity21 still not fit after a serious knee injury almost exactly a year ago , @entity20 operating better in a slightly deeper role and 33 - year - old @entity24 seen as a back - up , @entity0 has had little option but to keep putting his club - record signing back in the firing line			1
the @entity29 admits he does not think leaving out @entity3 now will benefit him , but they will focus on getting him back to peak fitness in the next couple of weeks			2
' @entity3 is still finding his best moment of form , ' he said			2
@entity1 manager @entity0 said he will not rest the @entity36 striker despite his poor form ' any player coming out of a @entity15 always takes a transitional period to get their fitness back to normal			1
' i think @entity43 has done incredibly to make himself available for the games we 've had			0
' only ( goalkeeper ) @entity47 has played the same amount of games and his desire to help the team has stopped him being able to concentrate on being fully fit			0
' over the next few weeks we are going to try to give him that physical element he needs , but he is a young man who will be an important player for us			0
the former @entity8 striker challenges @entity56 during the @entity58 derby , which ended 1 - 1 ' i think @entity43 needs to be playing and getting his match fitness and he is too important for , us so we ca n't afford to give him any resting period - i do n't think that would help him			0
' @entity3 's lack of goals and defensive lapses have contributed to a haul of just six points from seven matches which has left @entity1 17th in the table - a far cry from last season when they were in or just outside the top four for three - quarters of the campaign			1
@entity0 accepts they have contributed to their own failings so far , but despite being much worse off position-wise than they were 12 months ago , he is not about to start re-evaluating his projections for the season			2
@entity0 claimed that @entity3 's involvement in the @entity15 was likely to have hindered his form this season ' i still feel in the league we are still suffering from dropping four points in the two early games at @entity83 and against @entity84 , ' he said ahead of the visit of @entity86			1
' it is not a moment to assess where we are in the league			0
it is a period where we are working to get ourselves in the best possible position before we start the final third			0
' we 're taking every game slowly and for us the only concentration is @entity86			0
' @entity86 is the last team you want to play at home			2
they got a very good win at @entity100 - we all know how difficult it is there - and then they went to @entity104 and got an impressive result there			0

@entity3 has scored just twice since his £ 28million summer move
@entity1 are currently 17th in the @entity110 table
@entity0 says they will play @entity3 back into form
