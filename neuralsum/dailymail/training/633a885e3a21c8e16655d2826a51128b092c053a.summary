the @entity9 could be confronted with divided loyalties as head of state for both the remainder of the @entity13 and a breakaway nation north of the border			1
though nationalists insist it would not be necessary , a solution could be to appoint a governor - general to act on behalf of the @entity9			0
there are also suggestions that prince @entity22 may have to receive a second coronation if he is crowned @entity5 ’s @entity24			0
@entity5 ’s first minister @entity25 insisted this week that the @entity1 would be ‘ proud ’ to become ‘ queen of @entity5 ’ in the event of a @entity28 vote , and risked the wrath of the @entity30 by hinting that she told him as much in a recent visit to @entity33			1
though the @entity1 is thought to be passionately in favour of the @entity36 , @entity30 took the highly unusual step of warning earlier this week that she should not be dragged into the debate			1
a spokesman for the @entity9 said she was ‘ above politics ’ and dismissed suggestions that she should publicly intervene in the referendum campaign			0

though significant numbers of @entity5 nationalists want a republic , mr @entity25 has insisted the @entity1 will become head of state of an independent @entity5			1
@entity52 , professor of constitutional law at @entity54 , said the @entity1 may need to consider her role if the @entity13 does break apart next week			1

‘ one solution would be to establish an office of governor - general in @entity68 to act in the @entity1 ’s name			0
