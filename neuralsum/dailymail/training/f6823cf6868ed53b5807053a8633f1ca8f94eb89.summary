another example of wearable technology is smart watches			0

' there are lots of gadgets in the space , ' @entity1 said			2
' i would say that the ones that are doing more than one thing , there 's nothing great out there that i 've seen			0
' nothing that 's going to convince a kid that 's never worn glasses or a band or a watch or whatever to wear one			2
' @entity1 also hinted at @entity2 's tv plans			1
' there is a very grand vision of this , ' @entity1 claimed when asked about plans for a tv service			1
