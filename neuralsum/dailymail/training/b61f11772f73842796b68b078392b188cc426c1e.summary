convicted rapist @entity0 was allowed to stay in the country mps last night accused the @entity3 of ' complete failure ' as it emerged killers , rapists and sex attackers are among 760 foreign criminals allowed to go on the run			1
the ' dysfunctional ' department had still not managed to get a grip on the shambolic system for deporting overseas convicts , @entity11 's public accounts committee said			1
in addition to the criminals who have simply vanished , 151 inmates were freed without even being considered for removal			1
meanwhile , £ 6.2million in compensation was paid to 229 foreign national offenders because of @entity3 delays in dealing with their cases – an average of £ 27,000 each			1
mps were scathing about the lack of progress since 2006 when then home secretary @entity28 was forced to resign over the failure to boot out 1,000 foreign criminals			1
since then , the number of officials working on deportations has increased by 800 , from 100 to 900			0
but , incredibly , the number of overseas convicts clogging @entity36 's packed jails remains stuck at 10,000			1
the annual cost of managing and removing foreign criminals is estimated at £ 850million			1
in a joint statement , committee chairman @entity39 , a @entity41 mp , and @entity43 @entity42 made a blistering attack on the @entity3			1
they said : ' there has been a complete failure to improve the management and removal of foreign national offenders			1
despite firm commitments to improve and a massive ten-fold increase in resources , the system still appears dysfunctional			2
' the mps add : ' processing foreign national offender cases for removal starts too late , takes too long and costs too much			1
at the most basic , it takes on average 32 days to send out the 50 - question paper form to start the process and almost half of these forms are ignored or not returned			0
' the approach to case working is grossly inefficient , often featuring avoidable processing delays and administrative errors			2
' of the many failures highlighted in the report , arguably the most serious is the loss of contact with 760 ex-inmates			0
they were released pending deportation , with strict instructions to stay in contact with the @entity3			0
@entity11 's public accounts committee chairman @entity39 , a @entity41 mp , made a blistering attack on the @entity3 the @entity43 are to use a new @entity81 to stop criminals using @entity83 as a ' get out of jail free card '			1
@entity43 lawyers have prepared a draft bill which would stop violent criminals , suspected terrorists and illegal immigrants from claiming the right to a ' family life ' to avoid being deported			1
@entity36 judges would be given the power to ignore rulings from the the @entity95 in @entity96			0
it could include rulings against the ban on prisoners voting and the police joining trade unions , the @entity97 reported			0
but @entity103 , @entity104 , a leading human rights lawyer and cross-bench peer , told the newspaper that the bill 's architects were using human rights as ' a political tool to be manipulated for narrow and partisan advantage '			1
former @entity43 foreign secretary sir @entity112 said : ' if the purpose of this proposal is to take the @entity36 back to where it was before the incorporation of the @entity119 into @entity36 law , i am pretty relaxed about it — as long as we do not remove the convention itself and retain its authority , which is so vital in dealing with dictatorships and despots			1
' however , they have since vanished and can not be traced			0
they include as many as 12 killers , 11 rapists , 152 drug dealers , at least 23 other sex offenders – including five paedophiles – 33 robbers and 46 violent thugs			2
overall , there are 4,200 foreign criminals walking @entity36 's streets who are subject to deportation proceedings			2
all serious foreign criminals should at least be considered for removal but , in 151 cases since 2009 , this did not happen			1
this group includes three burglars , 19 robbers and eight sex offenders			2
officials have since traced 141 of them , but ten remain at large			0
the public accounts committee , @entity11 's spending watchdog , highlighted a string of delays and other failings			2
for example , only 30 per cent of foreign nationals arrested were checked against a key overseas database for a criminal record last year			1
@entity160 say at least £ 70million a year could be saved if police forces made better use of the information available on this and other databases			2
if officials identify a person has a criminal conviction overseas , they can kick them out at an early stage			2
currently , there are over 5,600 foreign national offenders still in prison , immigration removal centres or living in the community after the end of their sentence while the @entity3 continues to try to deport them			1
to @entity160 ' fury , the @entity3 has not been deciding whether to deport foreign national offenders until 18 months before their earliest removal date			1
inmates then submit countless appeals to further delay the process			2
shadow home secretary @entity183 said : ' this is a damning report of failure and incompetence in @entity187 's @entity3			0
previous home secretaries have resigned over this kind of thing			0
these findings come hot on the heels of reports showing growing backlogs in asylum claims , thousands of failed asylum seekers going missing , and major failures in background checks on people claiming @entity36 citizenship , which meant a killer was able to become a @entity36 citizen			0
' @entity203 , of the @entity204 , said the failings showed a ' desperate need to tear up the system and start again '			0
immigration minister @entity208 said 22,000 foreign criminals had been removed since 2010 despite an almost 30 per cent surge in appeals			2
he said last year 's @entity212 , which cuts appeal routes for foreign criminals from 17 to four , and other measures ' will help us identify , remove and ban more foreign criminals than ever before '			0
rapist : sex attacker @entity0 a convicted sex attacker who raped two children fought deportation on human rights grounds			1
@entity0 , 42 , was also jailed for a separate rape of a teenager			0
one of the children was just four years old when she was abused by the @entity228 national			0
a judge said in 2011 that it was ' remarkable ' @entity0 had not been thrown out of @entity36 after he raped the 16 - year - old			0
yet the rapist was freed on immigration bail while he challenged the move on the grounds that he had a right to a family life			0
it was deemed that @entity0 had a right to remain with his family because he has a girlfriend and a young child			0
@entity0 also stalled the deportation process following claims that he had ' mislaid ' his passport			0
it is believed that @entity0 is still in @entity36 .			0

151 inmates were freed without even being considered for removal
meanwhile £ 6.2million compensation paid to 229 foreign offenders
