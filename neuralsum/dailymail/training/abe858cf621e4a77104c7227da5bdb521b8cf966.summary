by @entity0 published : 03:49 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 07:24 est , 18 february 2013 @entity1 will be tested for steriods after the banned drugs were allegedly found in his house after he shot dead his girlfriend @entity5			1
police are also reported to have recovered a bloodied bat from the @entity10 champion ’s bedroom and to have established that model @entity12 ’s skull had been ‘ crushed ’			1
there was also evidence of heavy drinking before the shooting took place at 3am on @entity19 , reports the @entity20 @entity22 police are investigating whether @entity1 beat his girlfriend @entity5 unconscious with a cricket bat before shooting her after a bloodied bat was reportedly found at his home police are investigating whether @entity1 , nicknamed ' @entity1 ' , was in the grip of ' roid rage ' - the side - effect of taking large quantities of the drug - when he pulled the trigger			1
his blood samples are being tested and a source told @entity20 : ' steroid drugs were found at @entity1 ’s home together with evidence of heavy drinking			1
that ’s why police have specifically ordered that he be tested for steroids			2
' meanwhile , the bat and other evidence – a smashed bathroom door , a 9mm pistol , the peculiar pattern of wounds on the body and reports of a row earlier in the evening – is said to have led police to believe the murder case against the sprinter is ‘ rock solid ’			2
miss @entity5 , 29 , was shot four times early on thursday at @entity1 ’s luxury home in a secure housing estate on the outskirts of @entity53			1
police have rubbished speculation that @entity1 – who is known to have kept a pistol by his bed and a machine gun at his bedroom window – may have mistaken his girlfriend of three months for an intruder			1
prosecutors have formally charged @entity1 with premeditated murder but his family say he firmly denies such a charge			2
yesterday it emerged that he called his close friend @entity67 shortly after the killing – reportedly before the emergency services were alerted – and told him : ‘ there has been a terrible accident , i shot @entity5			1
’ @entity1 , pictured in court , called close friend @entity67 after the killing and said ' @entity74 take me away ' mr @entity67 rushed to the house , where he said @entity1 repeatedly told him : ‘ my baba , i ’ve killed my baba			1
’ while no officials would comment publicly on the case , a disturbing – though disputed – picture of what may have happened in @entity1 ’s home started to emerge			2
@entity84 have said they heard shouting coming from the house at around 1.30am			0
there were some suggestions , quickly denied , that the row may have been about miss @entity5 ’s friendship with a rugby player			1
at around 3.20am , four shots rang out – apparently not all at once			0
the first person @entity1 called was his father @entity91 , 59			1
when he arrived , he allegedly saw his son carrying his nightie - clad girlfriend down the stairs			0
she had been shot in the head , hip , arm and hand			0
@entity1 – and later paramedics – struggled in vain to save miss @entity5 ’s life			1
police reportedly found the bloodied cricket bat in the bedroom			1
the en - suite bathroom door was riddled with holes , a pistol holster was found by @entity1 ’s bed and a gun cartridge was on the floor			2
@entity22 ’s @entity111 quoted an unnamed police source as saying : ‘ the suspicion is that the first shot , in the bedroom , hit her in the hip			1
she then ran and locked herself in the toilet			0
‘ she was doubled over because of the pain			0
he fired three more shots			0
she probably covered her head , which is why the bullet also went through her hand			0
’ rugby star @entity124 's agent said the ' sad ordeal ' was nothing to do with him in response to rumours that had circulated about the nature of the @entity131 's friendship with miss @entity5 the source said police are carrying out tests to establish whose blood is on the bat			1
while one scenario is that @entity1 attacked @entity12 with the wooden bat , it has also been claimed that the model may have used it to defend herself			1
a third possibility is that @entity1 used it to break down the bathroom door			2
those close to @entity1 have suggested that he may done so in a bid to ‘ save ’ his dying girlfriend			0
according to this theory , the athlete first shot @entity12 by accident , whereupon she fled to the bathroom			0
he then shot at the door lock to try to get in , accidentally killing her			0
@entity1 ’s father appeared to suggest it is this version that he believes			2
while he admitted that he had not talked to his son in detail about what happened , he said he had ‘ zero doubt ’ that the sportsman thought miss @entity5 was an intruder			1
a more likely defence from @entity1 is to acknowledge that there was a row but that he did not intend to kill her			0
@entity1 : @entity1 ran in both the @entity164 and @entity10 last year some in @entity22 have speculated about the nature of miss @entity5 ’s friendship with @entity131 rugby player @entity124 , and whether this played a part in the tragedy			1
the 24 - year - old was keen to distance himself from such reports at the weekend			0
his agent said : ‘ this whole sad ordeal has got nothing to do with him			0
’ last night @entity1 ’s agent said he had withdrawn him from all planned races but insisted his sponsors were sticking by him			2
the tragedy has also cast fresh light on @entity1 ’s apparent attraction to danger and weaponry			0
miss @entity5 's father @entity186 wept as he said he and his wife june were at ' a complete loss ' as well as owning a pistol and machine gun , at the time of miss @entity5 ’s death he reportedly had seven outstanding firearm licence applications			1
one was for same type of assault rifle used in the recent @entity196 in the @entity197			0
@entity1 , who was charged with premeditated murder at a court appearance on friday , spent the weekend in a police cell ahead of a second hearing planned for tomorrow at which his lawyers are expected to ask for bail			2
police say they will oppose the request			0
