by @entity0 from up on high , it looks stunning : an inland sea dotted with the occasional ancient church tower and hill settlement			1
it probably looked much like this when @entity7 was burning his cakes and outsmarting the @entity9 on a little hillock called @entity11 , a mile or so from where i am standing			1
back then , it was called the @entity11			1
today , it is cut off by the waters once more			1
but there ’s nothing pretty or enchanting about all this down at ground level			1
when the breeze falters , you catch a whiff of uncorked septic tank			1
the high water mark is lined with grime			1
the one thing these firemen are unlikely to encounter is a fire			1
this 65million cubic tons of filthy water is barely moving			1
‘ we ’ve seen it all washed up outside – condoms , syringes , worse ... ’ says @entity49 of @entity50 , eight miles to the west			1
‘ i ca n’t let the children out in the garden because of what ’s out there			1
’ it is a grim but neat symbol of the chaos afflicting this historic swathe of @entity31 : for this is not a natural phenomenon			1
nearly 30,000 acres are submerged , but this is a man - made problem with man - made symptoms and it will require man - made solutions			1
no one in this part of the world seems in any doubt about who is to blame : the elusive quangocrats of the @entity76			1
their new orthodoxy is that everyone should stop interfering and let things take their natural course			1
it ’s an attractive idea if you are ticking environmental boxes in @entity85 – or if you are a water vole			1
if you are watching your home , your family business , your children ’s birthright sink before your eyes , it is a disgrace			2
making do : residents are ferried from @entity93 to @entity38 by farmer @entity94			2
20 per cent of the entire county of @entity31 is submerged by floodwater isolated : a police boat carries residents of the village of @entity38 , seen in the background which has been cut off for weeks by the flooding surrounded : an aerial view shows how the @entity31 village of @entity39 has been transformed by the floods into an island there is nothing new about flooding on the great plains known as the @entity109 – as @entity7 would testify			1
from the @entity111 to medieval monks to 17th century @entity114 engineers to @entity116 prisoners , people have been building banks , ditches and sluices to drain this part of the countryside and grow things			2
every winter it would flood for a bit and then drain away			2
once in a lifetime , the flooding would be very bad indeed and over-run a few homes			2
that was simply the risk you took when you lived on the @entity131			2
the trouble is , there was a ‘ once in a lifetime ’ flood last winter , in november 2012			2
and now this one ’s even worse			2
the people of @entity31 are unanimous in what has needs to be done			2
they point out that the @entity76 stopped dredging the rivers and flogged off the dredging machinery 20 years ago			1
now it ’s payback time			2
‘ start dredging again ! , ’ says every single person i meet from one end of this 20 - mile lake place to the other			1
‘ if your bathplug is clogged with hair , then you unclog it , ’ says @entity27 , farmer and father of leading fashion designer @entity152 , as he takes me by tractor to the home of his 98 - year - old father ( now safely evacuated )			2
the water is black and knee - deep in the kitchen			2
we had dredging for generations and houses did n’t flood			1
then they stopped dredging and look what happens ! ’ he points out that it took military expertise to resolve that ghastly epidemic of foot and mouth disease in 2001			1
‘ i ’d have greater faith in the @entity76 if there was a brigadier in charge of it			1
’ ‘ if you let your gutters get blocked , you get trouble , ’ says a regular at the bar of the @entity182 at @entity183			2
just outside , an extraordinary hill called the @entity188 offers a superb panoramic view of the problem			2
landlady @entity191 makes a telling observation			2
flood water is pumped into the @entity194 by the @entity76 in @entity195 , @entity31 , @entity196			1
@entity76 chairman lord @entity197 , the chairman admits dredging is likely to be part of the plan to reclaim flooded land struggle : a resident of @entity39 village makes her way along a flooded street			1
the people of @entity31 are unanimous in what has needs to be done			2
treading carefully : a couple approach flood water on the road at @entity183 in @entity31			0
the @entity76 stopped dredging the rivers and sold the dredging machinery 20 years ago in the old days , when the waterways dried out , they used to be @entity217 thanks to dredging work			1
now , they are v - shaped			0
by the @entity76 ’s own admission , the capacity of the @entity220 , a few yards away , is down by 40 per cent			1
the water is seeping up through the flagstones below the pool table , but it ’s business as usual			0
in fact , the place is buzzing			0
on an adjacent table , i meet three other members of the @entity27 family			0
‘ we ’ve always had flooding , but not like this , ’ says @entity231 , @entity27 ’s wife			0
it ’s a birthday pub lunch for elder daughter , @entity236 , 36 , a mother of two , but the talk is of ruined apple crops and marooned sheep			0
younger daughter @entity240 , 32 , a photographer , has been capturing images of these floods for weeks			0
‘ @entity76 are trying to blame all this on extreme weather , but the weather is not that unusual , ’ she explains			1
‘ it ’s just the water has nowhere to go			0
’ another group of locals walk in with matching sweatshirts			0
they all say : ‘ start dredging			1
’ i contact the @entity76 , where a spokesman reiterates the official line : ‘ increased dredging of rivers on the @entity109 would not have prevented the recent widespread flooding because of the sheer volume of rainfall			1
’ yesterday , we heard the head of the @entity76 , @entity263 [ @entity264 ] @entity197 , a former @entity265 minister , argue that these floods are a complex issue and , thus , there are no easy answers			1
widespread : flood waters surround farm buildings in @entity195 , @entity31			0
an area the size of 40 sq miles of the @entity109 remains flooded left behind : debris washed up by flood water is seen at @entity49 's farm in @entity195 , @entity31 almost knee - deep : farmer @entity49 stands in front of bales of animal feed as he surveys flooded land at his farm in @entity195 , @entity31 getting through : a @entity282 splashes into flood waters surrounding farm buildings in @entity195 , @entity31 around here , the mere mention of his name invokes snorts of derision			0
‘ @entity294 mp , was n’t he ? ’ says farmer @entity94 , giving me a lift on the tractor ferry with which he has been taking people in and out of @entity39			0
@entity94 has another bone to pick with officialdom			0
the county council has just told schools that children may no longer travel to class by tractor trailer			0
‘ it ’s so ridiculous it defies belief , ’ he says			0
presumably , on that basis , all carnival floats are henceforth illegal			0
these are people who know the ways of these ancient and complex water courses			0
and , in their view , that knowledge has been completely ignored by officialdom and yet they are the ones left to suffer the consequences			0
little wonder the environment secretary , @entity317 , had such a hostile reception when he dropped in earlier this week			0
it did n’t help that it had taken three weeks for him to come and that he failed to visit a single flooded home			0
perhaps his greatest sin was to arrive in a pair of black shoes			0
‘ where were his @entity327 boots ? ’ asks @entity27			0
vow : environment secretary @entity317 promised a new plan to deal with flooding in @entity31 in six weeks after facing their anger on a visit yesterday ‘ he was a man walking into a storm and he does seem to have had a good kicking , ’ says @entity333 , the good - humoured , unofficial ‘ harbourmaster ’ of @entity38 – on the grounds that the ‘ ferry terminal ’ is next to his garden gate			0
none of these people is moaning about flooding per se			0
it is the needless extent of the problem which upsets them – and the fact that this is the second time this has happened in 14 months			0
@entity49 ’s family have farmed this patch of the @entity109 for 150 years			1
but now , for the first time , his parents are homeless , driven out by the floods			0
‘ my father ’s 88 with dementia , so it ’s very important to keep things familiar			0
but how can you do that in this ? ’ for three weeks now , 790 of the family ’s 840 acres have been underwater			0
the last flood cost him £ 163,000			0
this one will cost the same again and may even put the farm out of business			0
in which case , @entity364 will be without @entity366 for the first time since @entity369 @entity368 , at least the water voles should be alright .			0
