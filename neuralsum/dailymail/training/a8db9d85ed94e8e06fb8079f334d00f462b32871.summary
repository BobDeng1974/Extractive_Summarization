this week the @entity0 serialised intensive care nurse @entity2 's new book on @entity4			1
the response from readers has been unprecedented , with thousands of you writing in with your own remarkable stories , some of which we published yesterday			1
here we share more readers ' gripping tales of premonitions and visions			1
ghostly visions : readers say they have seen relatives appear before them at the moment they passed away @entity21 @entity21 , 67 , a retired store manager , lives in @entity22 with her husband @entity23 and has two grown - up children			1
she says : it was one o'clock in the morning in may 1982 when the ring of the doorbell woke us up			1
my husband @entity23 went downstairs to answer the door then returned to the bedroom looking miffed , saying nobody was there			1
for some unknown reason i had a strong sense it was my 25 - year - old younger brother @entity38			1
he was in the @entity40 and based nearby			1
a few seconds later it rang again and @entity23 traipsed back down the stairs			1
again , there was nobody there			1
it buzzed a few more times after that , but we decided to ignore it			2
at 10am the next morning my father phoned with devastating news			2
some officers had arrived to inform him that @entity38 had been killed in a helicopter crash in the @entity55			2
at that stage we knew very few details of how he had died but that night my oldest son , @entity59 , who was then eight , had a dream that his @entity38 had risen up out of the water with his arms up and said : ' do n’t worry about me			1
' incredibly , i too had experienced the exact same dream			1
we later learnt that the helicopter had crashed into the @entity65 and @entity38 had drowned			2
@entity66 @entity66 , 43 , a divorced police officer , lives in @entity67 with her five children : @entity69 , 23 , @entity70 , 19 , @entity71 , 17 , @entity72 , 13 and @entity73 , ten			2
she says : in april 2003 i gave birth to a beautiful healthy baby boy who i called @entity73			2
my then husband @entity76 and i were over the moon			2
but when @entity73 was just a few months old a horrible , dark feeling crept over me , day and night			1
i ca n't explain why but i felt a hideous dread that my son was going to die			1
i did n't tell anyone because i worried they would think it was postnatal depression , but the feeling persisted			2
a few months later when my mother , @entity84 , a super-fit 60 - year - old , came to my house to take my eldest children to school , i had the strangest experience			1
as she stood in the hallway waiting to leave i found myself staring at her , unable to look away			2
she met my gaze and it 's hard to explain but it was as though i was looking straight through her eyes and into her soul			2
she asked me why i was staring at her so strangely and i had to mumble an excuse and look away			2
after she left , just a few hours later , i received a phone call from @entity97 , her husband , telling me she had collapsed at home and had been taken to hospital			2
she died a couple of hours later of a dissecting thoracic aneurysm			1
i heard myself telling doctors : ' thank @entity103 , i thought it was my baby that was going to die			1
' @entity106 @entity106 , 67 , a retired mathematics lecturer , lives in @entity107 , @entity108			2
she says : i was lying in bed in my home in @entity107 one night in 1991 when i felt a presence in the room			1
i woke and ' saw ' my long dead grandmother @entity114 standing at the foot of my bed			2
she said : ' the gun fired at this time ' and i looked at the bedside clock and noticed it was exactly three o'clock			2
then she added : ' it was in the afternoon , not morning			2
' when i woke the next morning i discovered three small blisters on the outer surface of the bathroom radiator out of which water was seeping			2
i called a plumber and thought little of it			2
i visited my 78 - year - old father and told him what had happened the night before and his face turned pale			1
i had always known my grandfather @entity132 , his father , had died in the famous naval @entity133 in 1916 but i had failed to recall the date			1
' today is may 31st , 1991 , ' said my father , his face losing all its colour , ' the 75th anniversary of his death			0
' intrigued by my grandmother ’s reference to the time , i started to do some research			0
my grandfather 's ship , the @entity145 , had come under fire from the @entity147 and after a first volley of three shots hit the deck the ship blew up			0
the time it happened ? three in the afternoon			0
when i think of the vision and the number of holes in the radiator , a shiver goes down my spine			1
@entity159 @entity159 , 66 , lives with her husband @entity160 , in @entity161 , @entity162			1
the retired fishmongers have two grown - up children and four grandchildren			0
she says : in 1969 , when i was 22 , i worked in a local branch of a bank in @entity168			0
it was an old building and had a fireplace opposite the tills			0
it was early afternoon when i looked up and to my great surprise saw my great auntie @entity175 sitting in a chair ' in ' the fireplace			0
she was looking as she always did , wearing a green dress that i often saw her in and looking content and comfortable			0
i do n’t remember feeling any other emotion other than faint surprise			0
i was n't scared but i just thought , ' oh there 's auntie @entity182 '			0
she was n't in solid , human form and i knew somehow i would n't be able to touch her			0
i had worked at the bank for a couple of years already and knew better than to get up from my cashier 's desk when i had a queue of people standing in front of me , so i did n't get up			0
@entity194 lived above our family 's fishmongers and was still fit and well , despite being in her 80s			0
i remember she used to pinch our cheeks when she saw us ; i was dearly fond of her			0
i watched my great aunt sitting completely still in the fireplace for a few minutes before she disappeared			1
she never waved , nor even smiled at me			0
i just remember her looking in my direction quite serenely			0
i did n't tell anyone because i was worried they would laugh but minutes later i received a phone call from my mother to tell me @entity182 had just passed away from old age			1
i said , ' i know , i have just seen her			0
' @entity210 @entity210 , 60 , a psychotherapist , lives with her husband in @entity212			0
she says : because of my job i am used to trying to analyse rationally what goes on in people ’s minds			0
in 1999 , however , i had an experience which challenged my view of how the mind works and its capabilities			0
one night that summer i was lying next to my husband fast asleep at home when at about 2am i was woken by a hand that was n't my husband ’s gently tapping my right shoulder			1
sleepily , i opened my eyes and saw @entity227 , a friend from work , standing in front of me			0
days earlier @entity227 had gone on holiday to @entity231 , so i knew it could n't be him , really			0
but there he was nonetheless , shimmering , surrounded by a hazy light and wearing a white gown from the neck to the floor			0
he was smiling at me and looked relaxed and well			0
by now i was wide awake , my eyes straining to take it all in			0
i was n't scared , i just felt reassured and strangely comforted			0
it 's hard to explain , but it was an entirely good , peaceful sensation			0
he leant forward , gave me a bunch of lilies and left			0
i calmly fell asleep , not wanting to wake up my husband or share it with him as it had felt like a very personal experience			0
the next day at lunchtime i got a call from another mutual work friend			0
she told me @entity227 had died following a sudden heart attack while on holiday in @entity231			1
it had happened just hours before he appeared to me			0
it 's hard to explain why he visited me as we had only known each other for three years , and only ever in a work context , but it made me feel more at peace with death			0
@entity261 @entity261 , 62 , is a retired senior sales manager who lives in @entity262 with his partner @entity263 , a retired business owner			1
he has two grown - up sons			0
he says : one night in 1983 i woke up having had a nightmare that my neighbour had fallen off my roof and died			1
i woke up with my heart pounding and my skin covered in sweat , then moments later heard a man 's voice that i did n't recognise telling me to lie back down and he would explain the dream			1
confused , but keen to find out the meaning , i lay back down and heard the same voice explain slowly and deliberately that it was actually my mother @entity277 who was going to die , and that she was n't going to fall off a roof but give in to illness while surrounded by her family			1
i asked the voice when , and it said , quite precisely , in three months at 1.30pm			0
it then told me to go to sleep			1
i was n’t scared at all and drifted off straight after			0
the next day i told my wife @entity284 and rang up both my sisters to tell them what i 'd heard			1
our mother had been ill with parkinson 's disease for four years already but was coping relatively well on her own still			1
over the next three months , though , her condition spiralled downhill			0
the night before the day the dream had told me she would die , i was at her bedside with my three sisters and their husbands and my elder brother			1
i was crying in the corridor when my brother - in - law put his arm around me			1
i said it was no good and that i knew she was going to die tomorrow			1
the next day at 1.15pm her breathing suddenly worsened and she passed away at 1.30pm - the exact time and date that i had predicted three months earlier			1
