@entity10 , 63 , said he embarked on the project , @entity12 , to better understand why homosexuals would enlist in the military to begin with ; voluntarily signing up for a system that did , and in many ways still does , oppress them			1
' it seems i spent most of my life uninterested in knowing about the military because i supported peace , the fight to end violence and injustice , and the sanctity of life , ' the photographer told @entity29			1
' i could n't understand why anyone would join the military , much less why gay people would join the military , an organization that shunned them			1

many were discharged because of their sexuality , others were raped , assaulted and bullied , causing ongoing psychological damage			1
a major turning point for gay people in the military came in 2011 with the overturning of @entity51 ( @entity52 ) , a discouraging policy signed by @entity54 in 1993 that continued a ban on gay soldiers enlisting , but stopped investigations and ' witch hunts ' into whether soldiers were gay			1
the bill was designed to protect the soldiers by keeping their sexuality a secret , however it forced them into the closet and further internalized their struggles			1
