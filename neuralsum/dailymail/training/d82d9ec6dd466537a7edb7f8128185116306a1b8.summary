an unknown possessing an iconic football name lit up world football ’s most iconic knockout competition , as 2013 winners @entity4 were ousted from this year ’s @entity5 at the first hurdle			1
this was the one piece of major silverware that eluded managerial great @entity10 but his namesake @entity11 etched a chapter of his own with a virtuoso performance and delightful debut goal at the @entity15			1
@entity10 , 19 , was plucked from obscurity by @entity18 manager @entity17 and thrust into the third - round @entity20 derby to devastating effect			1
by the time he was withdrawn to a standing ovation seven minutes from time everyone was talking about him			2
@entity25 ( centre ) clips the ball over @entity29 to score the winner for @entity18 in the @entity5 third round @entity10 watches his shot sail over the @entity4 keeper to give @entity18 the lead on 76minutes the @entity18 striker wheels away to celebrate as @entity29 ( right ) looks on dejected @entity18 players rush to congratulate @entity10 after his winner earns the @entity38 local bragging rights @entity18 ( 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 ) : @entity40 7 ; @entity41 7 , @entity42 6 , @entity43 6 , @entity44 7 ; @entity45 6 , @entity46 7 , @entity47 7 ; @entity10 9 ( @entity48 83 ) ; @entity49 6 , @entity50 6 ( @entity51 62 , 6 )			1
subs ( not used ) : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57			2
@entity4 ( 3 - 5 - 2 ) : @entity58 8 ; perch 7 , @entity59 7 , @entity60 6 ; @entity61 6 ( @entity62 64 , 6 ) , @entity63 6 , @entity64 6 ( @entity65 53 , 6 ) , @entity66 7 , @entity67 6 ; @entity68 7 , @entity69 5 ( @entity70 46 , 5 )			1
subs ( not used ) : @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75			2
referee : @entity77 ( @entity78 ) 6			2
yet , it is fair to say some of those supporters would not previously have heard of him			2
the official club website did not have him numbered in the first - team squad until kick - off			2
but with @entity86 away on @entity88 duty , @entity10 was selected as wanderers ’ wandering waif behind the front men			0
everything went through the 5ft 4in playmaker , and when he was given a fourth sight of goal with just under a quarter of an hour remaining he showed there is a composed finish in the armoury too			0
accepting @entity47 ’s pass in his stride , he glided into the @entity4 area , drew the otherwise excellent former @entity18 goalkeeper @entity29 , delayed , and then dinked over his opponents ’s sprawled frame to settle the game			1
‘ it augurs well , ’ said @entity17			0
‘ we know with young players there may be a dip here or there but he is a talent			0
he is very diminutive but he ’s very strong , has a great low centre of gravity			0
he can drop the shoulder and go by people , and run with the ball at pace , and nine times out of 10 he takes the right option			0
he was a real threat			0
’ @entity4 manager @entity122 greets his @entity18 counterpart @entity17 ( right ) ahead of the game veteran striker @entity50 ( right ) made his return to the @entity5 after a spell in @entity127 former @entity128 striker @entity48 watches the game from the @entity18 bench @entity4 keeper @entity29 ( 2nd left ) denies @entity18 's @entity47 with one of many saves indeed , @entity10 ’s solo slaloms were a feature of @entity18 ’s most dominant period — the opening quarter of the second period — when he witnessed one effort destined for the top corner deflect wide , another force @entity29 into a full - length save and a third fizz the wrong side of an upright			1
after such an introduction it was only fair to question where @entity18 had been hiding this prodigious talent			1
@entity17 suggested his physicality — or lack of it — has held him back			0
‘ when you are that small , you have to be special and i think he is			0
we just have to be mindful we do n’t get carried away			0
’ @entity4 — unbeaten in 13 @entity5 matches discounting shoot - outs , and semi-finalists last season — did not field a single starter from the win over @entity157 two years ago , although their goalscoring hero from the bench that day , @entity64 , wore the armband			1
@entity4 midfielder @entity162 ( ground ) slides in to deny @entity49 of @entity18 a golden opportunity @entity18 keeper @entity40 ( right ) makes a save from @entity63 during a rare @entity4 attack @entity10 finally managed to break through the @entity4 keeper 's resistance deep into the second half @entity10 's clipped effort gave the home side a deserved victory after recording a total of 15 shots yet it was not until the half - time introduction of @entity70 , one of those @entity177 , that they threatened			1
@entity70 , who is expected to leave for a fee this month with four suitors pursuing him , was one of a trio of @entity4 players foiled by @entity40 , whose best save came during @entity18 ’s purple patch , when he spectacularly tipped @entity63 ’s close - range header over the top			1
so @entity122 failed to keep up the rich recent record of progress in the cup managed by @entity189 and @entity190 , although he insisted it was not for the want of trying			0
‘ we came here to win it , i have got great respect for the @entity5 and that showed , ’ @entity122 said			1
‘ it was a strong team and we could have won it			0

@entity18 defeated @entity4 1 - 0 in the @entity5 third round at the @entity15
@entity203 keeper @entity29 pulled off a series of *important* saves
*teenager* @entity25 scored the winner with a clipped shot after 76mins
