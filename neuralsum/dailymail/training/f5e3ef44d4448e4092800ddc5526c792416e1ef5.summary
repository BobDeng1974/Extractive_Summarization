by @entity0 do n't be put off by their rather curious appearance			0
black tomatoes are being grown in @entity4 for the first time – and they could have the potential to stave off cancer			1
the fruit is among the first in the world to contain anthocyanins , an antioxidant believed to help fight cancer , diabetes and obesity			2
the tomato ’s jet black colour stems from pigments in its skin which develop when exposed to sunlight			2
@entity4 first : the jet black tomatoes , grown by @entity22 from @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , are the only of their kind in the country plant man : expert @entity22 , above , was sent the seeds by a customer and was staggered when the fruit grew jet black on the vines @entity22 , 66 , who runs @entity34 , first came across the unusual fruit when a customer sent him a mystery package entitled ' black tomato '			1
confused by the enigmatic the label , he sowed the product and was stunned at the resulting black tomatoes which appeared			2
mr @entity22 , from @entity24 , @entity25 , said : ' a customer sent us some seeds just named ' black tomato ' last winter and we could n't believe that they were real so we sowed them in the spring to see			1
' we are always looking for something original			0
nobody has every produced black tomatoes , the closest they have got are brown ones and orange ones			2
' it was always something people thought was impossible , we thought it was an @entity55 hoax			0
' but when we grew them we realised they were jet black , we were absolutely staggered			0
' they are completely new , as far as i 'm aware they have never , ever been grown in this country before			0
' the tomatoes are believed to have been developed at @entity64 , in @entity65 , forming part of their ' @entity68 ' project			1
they are ripe when their colour changes from a shiny blue - purple to an almost jet black , with the bottoms of the tomatoes turning red			0
the dark version of the fruit rich high in beneficial anthocyanins , which are compounds found in fruits , vegetables and beverages			2
some believe the anti-oxidant can help with diabetes , cancer and obesity			0
they aroused interest of the scientific community after their powerful health boosting effects were discovered during @entity65 lab tests			1
unusual : the colour , a result of a genetic mutation , makes the fruit richer in health boosting anti-oxidants that its red cousin strong : @entity22 said he has eaten lots of his black tomatoes , describing them as having a ' good , strong ' flavour			1
mr @entity22 has a total of three plants , each containing 20 tomatoes which have black skins but are red on the inside			1
' no one can quite believe what we 've got , they keep asking if it 's a joke , or if they 're edible ' he said			0
' they are edible , we 've eaten lots , they have a nice taste and a really lovely flavour			0
the only way to describe it is a good , strong tomatoey taste			1
' ' the fruit is also unique because it does n't use genetic engineering to create it ' added mr @entity22 , who currently has no plans to market the black tomatoes			1
' it is entirely done by selection techniques			0
