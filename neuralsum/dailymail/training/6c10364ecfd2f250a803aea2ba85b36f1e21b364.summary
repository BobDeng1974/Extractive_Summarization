a children 's book by an anti-vaccination campaigner is being mocked in satirical online book reviews , which ridicule the author for telling kids that the measles is fun			1
many people would assume that the book ‘ @entity11 ’s @entity10 ’ is a joke , considering the disease is responsible for killing 145,000 people every year			1
however the picture book , which recounts a child ’s lovely day whilst suffering from the measles , is entirely serious about its anti-vaccination agenda			1
the joke is now on the author , @entity21 - based campaigner @entity20 , who is now being bombarded with scathing book reviews on @entity25			1
internet users are posting satirical book review to openly mock a a book by an @entity30 anti-vaccination advocate , titled ' @entity11 's @entity10 ' messenger says the aim of her book is to ' educate children on the benefits of having measles and how you can heal from them naturally and successfully			1
' she urges parents not to vaccinated their children , claiming that ' history has shown us that these diseases are quite benign and , according to natural health sources , beneficial to the body			0
' the characters in the book echo @entity31 's message , with one character telling her child : ' for most children it is a good thing to get the measles			1
many wise people believe measles make the body stronger and more mature for the future			2
' one star : a comment points out that measles is one of the leading causes of death amongst young children the @entity68 has responded , with some people even sarcastically thanking messenger			2
' as a carpenter who specializes in itty bitty coffins i ca n't say enough good things about this book , my customer base has been growing at an epidemic rate ! ' wrote one commenter , referencing the alarming number of children 's deaths due to the measles			1
he was one of only a few people to give the book a five star review , albeit insincere			2
however , one woman enthusiastically praised the book as one of her favourites of all time			0
' this is just a wonderful book in every way			0
i would n't have thought that anything could be as beautiful and heart - warming as " @entity97 's @entity96 " or " @entity98 " but i 'm now convinced			2
' up there with " @entity100 " among my favourite books of all time			1
' this book review points out the disastrous and permanent impact of measles on some children of the 1114 reviews , the book has received a whopping 872 one star ratings , with many disappointed commenters asking ' why ca n't i give this book zero stars ? ' some people claimed that the book does n't cater for the disabilities their child now suffers after contracting the measles			1
' my infant daughter went blind after contracting measles from an unvaccinated child , ' began one commenter			1
' yet there 's no braille version of this wonderful book for me to give her someday to explain to her how awesome the disease that took her sight away is			1
' ' i 'm so happy i bought a hard copy version of this book , ' wrote another delighted customer			2
' if i bought an audiobook , i never would have gotten my money 's worth as both of my daughters went deaf from @entity137			0
' they now have a great book and a lifelong disability to remind them how much i truly love them ! ' @entity143 compiles a list of possibly the most disturbing children 's books ever some bookworms gave recommendations for other books people might enjoy if they are a fan of ' @entity11 's @entity10 '			1
' check out other titles for children like : " @entity154 on our heads " , " @entity156 " , " @entity157 " and " @entity158			0
" ' almost , but not quite as good as " @entity159 "			0
' but i am looking forward to " @entity11 , @entity160 " ; and " so many funerals : a children 's @entity162 " , ' commented another			2
uncomfortable satire : the morbid posts use satire to point out how the book uses a light - hearted tone to share a very serious message some more worrying posts were from parents who expressed their relief after taking learning some valuable information from the compelling read			0
' finally ! a children 's book with an agenda i can get behind ! i always thought i loved kids until i actually had one of my own and boy was i wrong ! ' wrote one particularly concerning parent			0
' i researched anything and everything i could possibly do to get rid of the little brat , but i did n't want to be arrested for murder and childhood cancer is just too darn unpredictable			0
' messenger is dedicated to her cause , claiming that in modern society ' we are being bombarded with messages from vested interests to fear all diseases in order for someone to sell some potion or vaccine			0
' in fact , history shows that in industrialized countries , these diseases are quite benign and , according to natural health sources , beneficial to the body			0
' the measles vaccination is credited for a 75 % drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2013 .			0
