by @entity0 published : 18:40 est , 24 november 2013 updated : 20:55 est , 24 november 2013 ' trust and confidence ' : sir @entity3 will call for new media guidelines for relations between press and police relations between police and the media must ‘ encourage , not restrict , two - way openness and contact ’ so journalists can hold officers and their forces to account , a former head of @entity9 will say today			1
in what will be interpreted as a critique of a section of the @entity22 report into press standards , @entity3 will call for new media guidelines within forces which ‘ re-build trust and confidence ’			1
he is also expected to call for ‘ streamlined and minimal requirements ’ which do not restrict contact between officers and reporters			0
@entity3 , who served as @entity32 between 2000 and 2005 , will make a powerful intervention on police / media relations in a major report on policing to be published today			1
the report by the @entity38 on the @entity39 – headed by @entity3 – will make uncomfortable reading for current @entity42 commissioner sir @entity41 who has clamped down on unofficial contact between journalists and police officers and staff			1
it will also be perceived as a thinly - veiled attack on a section of @entity22 ’s report into press standards last year which controversially touched upon relations between police and the @entity54			1
it is also likely to be seen as a riposte to former parliamentary standards commissioner @entity57 , who last year published a controversial report calling for even stricter controls on the way police officers interact with journalists			2
it was adopted by @entity9 which warned officers against ‘ drinking ’ , ‘ flirting ’ or ‘ carousing ’ with reporters and told them to keep a note of any contacts			0
but critics say the ‘ blunt instrument ’ approach to police / media relations is counter-productive and could allow scandals in the force to be covered up			1
they argue it prevents newspapers such as the @entity76 exposing failings in the @entity79 case and revealing the corrupt practices of the now disgraced @entity81 commander , @entity81			0
in her report , ms @entity57 said the ‘ close relationship ’ between parts of @entity9 and the media had caused ‘ serious harm ’			0
sir @entity41 – who prior to the hacking scandal was regarded by many journalists as a ‘ very media - friendly police chief ’ – said new rules for officers about relationships with journalists would be implemented			2
critics say ms @entity57 ’s report , and that of @entity22 , have had a ‘ chilling effect ’ on police openness with the media			1
criticism : @entity22 , pictured with his report into press standards published last yea			2
it discussed relations between police and the press last year ’s @entity22 report called for a clampdown on police / media relations , with a record kept of meetings with senior officers and tighter curbs on briefings with reporters			1
it also warned police whistleblowers against going to journalists and advised officers to seek other ‘ confidential avenues in which they may have faith ’ , such as the @entity125			0
@entity22 wrote : ‘ there remains an important point of principle which i need to come back to : that information which is confidential should remain so , unless there really are exceptional circumstances justifying the placing of that information into the public domain			0
additionally , and looking at this more widely , the ends do not usually , or at least necessarily , justify the means			0
’ his report also said the term ‘ off the record briefing ’ should be scrapped			0
instead , there should be ‘ non-reportable briefing ’ , to inform reporters about things which can not be used in reports , and an ‘ embargoed briefing ’ when reporting of the content is delayed			0
clamp - down : sir @entity41 wants unofficial meetings between police and press to stop he did not recommend a blanket ban on officers chatting with reporters over drinks , but said the dangers should be set out by police chiefs			0
but critics say the @entity22 proposals have had a ‘ freezing effect ’ on police / media relations , meaning it is extremely difficult to hold forces to account on major stories already in the public domain – or scandals which have yet to be exposed			1
shortly after taking over as @entity42 chief , @entity3 – then sir @entity3 – said he wanted his officers and staff to engage fully with the media			2
but in his wide - ranging report today – which was commissioned by the @entity173 – lord @entity3 will address the breakdown in relations between officers and journalists in the aftermath of the hacking scandal and the @entity22 inquiry			1
he is expected to say the current policy of ‘ not engaging with the media ’ could cause ‘ serious problems with ensuring public confidence ’			0
it is understood that during his inquiry @entity3 and his high - powered team of ex police and security services ’ chiefs , as well as senior politicians and academics , were told by interviewees that the police ‘ need the media as much as media need police ’			2
@entity3 , who after leaving the @entity42 was briefly a columnist at the @entity198 , was also told the @entity57 report has failed because its foundation ‘ relied on too many anecdotes and misunderstanding and not on hard or reliable evidence ’			0
last night the @entity204 welcomed lord @entity3 ’s call for an improved media strategy .			1

lord @entity3 calls for new media guidelines to *rebuild* ' trust and confidence '
journalists must be able to hold police and forces to account , he will say
last year *'s* @entity22 report called for a clampdown on police / media relations
