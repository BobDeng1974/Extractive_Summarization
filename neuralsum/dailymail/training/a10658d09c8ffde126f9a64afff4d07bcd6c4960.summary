the release of @entity2 ’s @entity1 means there is now only a 2.4 - inch difference between the size of the phablet ’s screen , and the display on its ipad mini			2
and figures suggest this similarity could cause serious problems for @entity2 ’s tablet range			0
analysis has revealed that as phones become larger , more people use them for watching videos or reading - making their tablets almost redundant			0
in fact , the research found that people who recently upgraded to an @entity1 6 plus use their tablets 36 per cent less than before			1
@entity23 studied more than two million articles and videos opened using its app , and compared the before - and - after behaviour of @entity1 and @entity29 users			1
people with an @entity31 use their phone 55 % of the time , but this increases to 72 % for the @entity1 and 80 % for the @entity35 - both at the detriment of the @entity29 the research was carried out by @entity23 - an app that lets users save webpages , videos and other content for reading later			1
it analysed more than two million articles and videos that were opened using the app , and compared the before and after behaviour in people who previously owned an @entity1 5 , @entity48 and @entity31 and those who now own an @entity50			1
it also looked at the use of tablets by the same people			0
‘ the bigger your phone ’s screen , the more time you ’ll spend reading and watching on it , ’ explained the researchers in a blog post			0
‘ in fact , the bigger your phone ’s screen , the more you ’ll read and watch as a whole			0
’ it discovered that users who upgraded to an @entity1 6 now view content on their phones 72 per cent of the time , up from 55 per cent when they owned on a smaller screen			1
@entity23 also saw users with both an @entity1 and an @entity29 watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an @entity73			1
those with the @entity1 ( centre ) opened 33 % more articles and videos inside @entity23 than they did with a @entity31 ( left ) , and those with a @entity78 ( right ) opened 65 % more items than before users with an @entity1 6 now read on their tablets ( @entity81 and @entity29 mini pictured ) 19 per cent less during the week , and 27 per cent less over the weekend			1
while those with an @entity35 are on their tablets 31 per cent less during the week , and 36 per cent less over the weekend and @entity35 consume content on their phones 80 per cent of the time - the same ratio of phone to tablet reading as seen on @entity88			1
@entity23 also saw that users with both an @entity1 and an @entity29 watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an @entity73			2
the @entity1 6 accounted for 68 per cent of all sales through september and into early october , while its larger model took between 23 and 24 per cent			2
@entity2 's cheaper @entity31 and 5c handsets made up the rest of the sales			0
following last year 's launch , the @entity31 and @entity48 accounted for 84 per cent of total @entity1 sales in the first 30 days - proving the 6 range is more popular			0
the skew is being blamed on reports that stocks of the @entity35 are lower because @entity2 is struggling to complete orders			0
recent figures from @entity23 also found that two - and - a - half more @entity23 users are opting for an @entity1 as opposed to a 6 @entity78			2
those with the @entity1 6 now open 33 per cent more articles and videos inside @entity23 than they did with a 5 or @entity31 , and those with the 6 plus open 65 per cent more items than they did with a smaller phone			1
users with an @entity1 6 now read on their tablets 19 per cent less during the week , and 27 per cent less over the weekend			1
while those with a 6 @entity78 are on their tablets 31 per cent less during the week and 36 per cent less over the weekend			0
‘ that being said , there remains one place where tablets still hold reign : your nightstand , ’ added the researchers			0
‘ regardless of which @entity1 they have , users still reach for their @entity29 around 9pm for some late - night , bedtime reading			0
’ but , a larger screen does make it less portable and @entity23 noticed that people with an @entity35 read 22 per cent less on their morning commutes than those with a smaller model			1
recent figures from @entity23 also found that two - and - a - half more @entity23 users are opting for an @entity1 as opposed to a 6 @entity78			2
‘ this tells us that , at least for now , convenience and portability trump a better , and bigger , entertainment and reading experience			0
