by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 was a joy to watch but his @entity5 arsenal do n't deserve @entity6 ... he should play alongside @entity8 listening to @entity11 chairman @entity10 struggle to pronounce @entity13 ’s name as he spoke at the @entity14 last week , it struck me that he might actually not know what he ’s talking about			0
his passionate belief that we need to find a way to get more @entity21 players into @entity23 first teams is sound enough : but the logic behind his solution is shambolic at best			1
i interviewed @entity26 this week , the @entity28 striker who was thrown into the first team by @entity30 , and who subsequently rewarded the manager ’s faith with the goals that produced the miracle of the great escape at the @entity37			2
@entity38 repaid : @entity21 striker @entity26 contributed crucial goals as @entity28 escaped the @entity23 relegation zone right choice : @entity28 manager @entity30 opted for @entity26 over @entity42 it might seem like a no - brainer – do you select @entity26 or @entity42 ? the @entity46 had a spell at @entity48 but scored just one @entity23 goal and he was sent off in a crucial defeat which virtually sealed the club ’s relegation			1
undeterred , @entity28 decided to bring @entity42 back to this country on a whopping four - year contract and he has scored one @entity23 goal this season			1
some would say @entity26 was overpriced at £ 8.1m - it fits with the myth that @entity21 players are too expensive			1
well @entity59 cost £ 30m , @entity60 £ 26m – how have they been getting on ? @entity62 cost @entity63 £ 600,000 and @entity64 cost @entity65 just £ 5.9m from @entity66			0
these two would get into most top @entity69 sides			0
@entity21 players do n’t have to cost a fortune , not if you look hard enough			1
but even when they do they can be worth it			0
@entity73 has provided @entity74 with value for money in terms of the transfer fee in the 10 years since his £ 27m switch from @entity65			0
sound investment : @entity82 left - back @entity64 cost @entity65 £ 5.9m when they signed him from @entity66 value for money : @entity73 cost @entity74 £ 27m a decade ago but has repaid them in full there have been some young @entity21 players put into @entity23 teams this season who have flourished : @entity90 at @entity91 is a great example – he did n’t let anyone down			1
@entity94 at @entity65 , @entity95 and @entity96 at @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity26 at @entity28 , @entity99 at @entity100 , @entity101 at @entity102 , and numerous examples at @entity104			2
the answer is not to send these players to a new league 3 , risking the robust health of the lower divisions			0
the answer is to put them into the first teams in the @entity23			1
it has happened right in front of @entity10 ’s eyes this season and yet somehow it seems to have passed him by			2
outstanding : @entity94 has enjoyed an excellent season with @entity65 and has subsequently been called up to the @entity82 squad for the @entity121 class : @entity100 's @entity99 , seen here taking on the @entity124 defence , has also impressed in a number of matches controversial : @entity10 's plans to introduce a @entity23 3 between the @entity128 and the @entity129 to help foster young @entity21 talent was met with widespread criticism @entity26 scored the winning goal for @entity133 17s to win the @entity134 in 2010 and he was excellent throughout the whole tournament			1
in the course of our conversation , @entity26 told me he was surprised that more players from that @entity82 squad in 2010 had n’t made the breakthrough			0
last season only @entity26 ( at the end of the season ) , @entity94 and @entity146 ’s @entity145 played regularly in the @entity23			1
others from that squad have talent and should make the breakthrough next season after serving their time on loan at a lower level : @entity146 ’s @entity155 is a superb passer of the ball ; it ’s about time we saw @entity158 in regular action in the top flight ; and i am certain that had @entity162 come through at @entity91 or @entity100 he would be a first team regular by now			2
the current @entity82 under 17s have made the final again this year – superb goals from @entity168 ’s @entity167 and @entity170 ’s @entity169 won the semi against @entity172			0
bright young thing : @entity168 's @entity167 scored a delightful chip against @entity172 as @entity82 reached the final of the @entity176 individual brilliance : @entity169 celebrates after doubling @entity82 's lead in the semi-final match in @entity180 and the @entity181 controlled the ball superbly against @entity183 with @entity184 starring , as he has for @entity185 for most of the season			1
clubs like @entity168 need a change in mentality which i think the fans would welcome – watching their most talented teenager @entity193 in recent weeks , it ’s clear he is surely too good to be ignored			0
i hope @entity195 shows some bravery and picks him			0
and i sincerely hope the fact that @entity193 is on course to be a millionaire before he even kicks a ball for @entity168 ’s first team does n’t rob him of the hunger to succeed			0
hat - trick hero : @entity184 scored all three goals as @entity181 beat @entity183 3 - 1 in their latest @entity134 qualifier first team chance ? @entity168 's @entity208 has been outstanding for their under - 21 and youth teams this season the answer is right in front of @entity10 ’s eyes – he does n’t need @entity213 ’ ludicrous ramblings to help with this one			2
dispel this appalling stereotype that @entity21 players have no technique , enforce a rule making clubs put the better homegrown youngsters in the first team , and sit back and enjoy the results			2
as @entity65 have shown with @entity94 this season , with the right coaching , the talent will emerge			1
the talent is there , it needs the right guidance and coaching - and the stage for it to flourish .			0

@entity21 young guns have lit up the @entity23 this season
@entity234 , @entity94 and @entity235 among those rewarded with @entity121 place
their place is in @entity23 first teams , not @entity242
under 21s and under 17 success *suggest* bright future
