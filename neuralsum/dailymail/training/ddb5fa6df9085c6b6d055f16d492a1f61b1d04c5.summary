by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 @entity2 continued to play giant killer at the @entity5 , upsetting @entity7 @entity6 6 - 4 6 - 3 on saturday to storm into the final of the @entity11 hard court event			1
after knocking off world number @entity12 in the third round and taking out twice champion and eighth seed @entity17 in the quarters , the muscular @entity3 pushed the seventh seeded @entity6 on a steaming centre court to reach his second final of the season			1
the 13th seeded @entity2 will now face 17 - time grand slam champion and twice @entity11 champion @entity23 in the final			1
giant killer : @entity2 added @entity6 to his list of recent high profile victims in @entity11 wave to the crowd : @entity29 acknowledges the @entity11 crowd which also saw him beat @entity17 ' i 'm waiting for this moment since a couple of years now , ' said @entity2 , who has always enjoyed success on the @entity11 hard courts , reaching the semi finals in three of four visits but advancing to the finals only once			1
' it 's good because i always believe in myself during all these years and all this week where i lost against those guys and finally i get a little reward			2
' it will for sure make me stronger , keep my motivation at the highest level and it 's great			0
' @entity6 , rated one of the rising young talents on the @entity50 , had lost all three head - to - head meetings with @entity2 but with three titles under his belt this season stepped onto a sunny centre court as the favourite			2
powerful : the @entity3 enjoyed a close first set before a more comfortable second winning 6 - 4 6 - 3 getting into the groove : @entity2 is enjoying the form of his life at the @entity5 and will play in the final the scrappy @entity7 traded punches with the @entity3 in a tight opening set but could not convert any of his four break opportunities against an opponent , whose looks are often compared to a young @entity68			1
@entity2 , also has a well - earned reputation as a battler on the court , and showed his willingness to fight right from the opening serve , his determination rewarded with the only break of the first set to go up 5 - 4 then holding serve for a 1 - 0 lead			2
the second set was not as close , @entity2 breaking the @entity7 in the third game to gain control and then again to clinch the match , raising his fist into the air and shadow boxing his way out to centre court where he acknowledged the crowd			1
easy does it : @entity2 has reached the semi in three of his last four visits to @entity11 - this is his second final ' it 's not an easy loss for me , ' said @entity6			1
' i thought he played a good match but i think i did n't raise the bar , did n't raise up the level the way i wanted to			0
' still , i have to take the positive side of the week			0
i do n't put my head down for a second here , because it 's a good progress for me			0
' but i 'm still disappointed with the loss			0
i 'm not going to hide that			0
' i have to think positive			0
there is a lot of tournaments coming ahead			2
@entity106 is around the corner			0
' shame : @entity6 is building a big reputation on the tour but he could n't beat the in - form @entity3			1

@entity3 has already beaten @entity12 and @entity17
now he has also knocked out the seventh seeded @entity7 in semi final
@entity23 will face @entity2 in the final
@entity2 says he has been waiting for a moment like this for years
he has been enjoying success on the @entity11 hard courts
his good form bodes well ahead of the @entity106 coming up
