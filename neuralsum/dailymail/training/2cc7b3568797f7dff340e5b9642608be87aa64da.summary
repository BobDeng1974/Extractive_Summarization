by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:52 am on 15th january 2012 a failed @entity4 @entity3 probe , which became stuck in @entity6 's orbit after its rocket boosters failed to ignite , is expected to plunge back to @entity6 today somewhere in the @entity8 near @entity9			1
the @entity11 mission , which was billed as the most exciting @entity4 space mission in decades , aimed to retrieve soil samples from the @entity14			1
but to the embarrassment of @entity4 scientists the spacecraft , which has been described as a flying fuel tank , became stuck after an initially successful launch on november 8			1
doomed : the @entity11 probe blasts off successfully in november last year			2
it is expected to come crashing back to earth on sunday after its booster rockets failed to ignite and send it on its way to @entity3 since then it has slowly been losing altitude due to gravity 's pull			1
worryingly the 14 - ton spacecraft still has an estimated 11 tons of highly toxic rocket fuel on board , namely @entity35 and @entity36			1
mission controllers remain confident that most of the craft will disintegrate as it re-enters the earth 's atmosphere and the fuel is housed inside aluminum tanks which have a relatively low melting temperature			1
re-entry : the probe burns red hot as it approaches earth 's atmosphere in this image captured by the @entity50 tracking and @entity52 facility @entity53 , an independent @entity55 - based space observer , said : ' the fuel indeed poses lethal danger in case of close contact , but i have n’t heard of a single case of any civilians poisoned by rocket fuel from all the derelict satellites and failed rockets throughout the space era			1
' the objective reality is that it burns on re-entry			0
there is no reason to panic			0
' some experts believe that the fuel could have frozen and therefore survive the fiery descent , posing a strong threat if it spills over populated areas			1
@entity76 of the @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 , said that the probability is low that a large lump of toxic fuel will prove hazardous			1
he noted that some of the probe ’s equipment is dense and could survive re-entry , but added the odds are that any surviving pieces will end up in the ocean			0
he said : ' all the best rules in the world put in place to prevent uncontrolled satellites from crashing down do little if any good in the event of a launch failure			0
' this is always going to be the risk that something breaks , and you end up with a situation like this			0
you can minimize it , but you ca n’t prevent it entirely			0
' due to constant changes in @entity6 's upper atmosphere , which is strongly influenced by solar activity , the exact time and place of the satellite 's return has been difficult to predict			0
predictions on friday had the satellite re-entering over the @entity114 , east of @entity115 , around 3:22 p.m. est. now , it appears the probe will plummet back to @entity6 today somewhere in the @entity8 near @entity9			0
' the technology is such that there is no way we can control or predict where @entity11 will come down , ' said @entity123 , executive director of the @entity125 - based @entity124			0
' with 73 percent of the planet covered in water , odds are this thing is going to splash down rather than hit land , ' he said			2
' the chance that this is going to be a threat to anyone is extremely remote , but people are concerned			0
' flying fuel tank : the failed probe still has 11 tons of highly - toxic fuel on board they predict that only between 20 and 30 fragments of the @entity14 probe with a total weight of up to 200 kilograms will survive the re-entry			1
in 2008 , the @entity144 shot down a stranded @entity146 spy satellite reportedly to cut the contamination risk of 100 pounds ( 45 kg ) of rocket fuel			1
that satellite 's tank , however , was believed to have been made of metal alloys more resistant to heating than aluminum , @entity149 said			0
crashdown : a @entity156 image released by the @entity157 maps the huge area where controllers say the @entity11 will fall one component of @entity11 that likely will survive re-entry is a small return capsule specifically designed to make a crash landing back to @entity6 in 2014			0
@entity165 's return to @entity6 is being monitored by dozens of organizations , including the @entity167 , an offshoot of the @entity170 ' committee on the @entity171			0
the panel includes representatives from 12 space agencies , including @entity175 , @entity4 and @entity176			0
botched : the ambitious mission was meant to re-install pride in the @entity179 the spacecraft is the third large satellite to return to @entity6 since september , when @entity175 's defunct @entity182 fell out of orbit , showering debris into the @entity185			1
@entity50 's @entity187 x-ray telescope re-entered a month later over the @entity188			0
the $ 170 - million @entity11 mission was @entity4 ’s most expensive and the most ambitious space endeavor since @entity192 times			2
destination mars : the @entity11 probe being prepared for launch in november this year the spacecraft was intended to land on the crater - dented , potato - shaped @entity14 moon , collect soil samples and fly them back to @entity6 , giving scientists precious materials that could shed more light on the genesis of the solar system			1
the probe was successfully launched on november 9 and entered a preliminary orbit where its engines were supposed to fire to set it on its path to @entity3			2
they never did , and attempts to fix the glitch by @entity4 and @entity214 experts failed			2
@entity4 ’s space chief has acknowledged the @entity11 mission was ill - prepared and risks of its failure were high , but said that @entity157 had to give it the go - ahead so as not to miss the limited @entity6 - to - @entity3 launch window			1
@entity11 marked @entity4 ’s first planned foray beyond @entity6 ’s orbit since a botched 1996 robotic mission to @entity3			1
that probe , designed by the same @entity226 company , crashed shortly after launch due to an engine failure			0
the firm also built two other @entity14 - bound probes that failed in 1988			0
the crash of @entity232 generated strong international fears because of some 200 grams of plutonium onboard			0
the craft eventually showered its fragments over the @entity239 - @entity238 border in the @entity240 , and the pieces were never recovered			0
@entity242 is the larger and closer of the two moons of @entity3 , the other being @entity244			1
both moons were discovered in 1877 , @entity242 named after the @entity247 god @entity242 , a son of @entity248 ( @entity3 )			1
a small , irregular - shaped object , @entity242 orbits @entity3 closer than any other known moon orbits its planet			1
it orbits so close to the planet that it moves around @entity3 faster than @entity3 itself rotates			2
as a result , from the surface of the planet , @entity242 would rise in the west , move rapidly across the sky ( in a little over four hours ) and set in the east			2
indeed , its orbit is decaying and will eventually smash into the surface of @entity3 or break up into a @entity263 - like planetary ring			2
@entity242 is one of the least - reflective bodies in the solar system , and features a large impact crater , @entity268 crater			2
@entity242 has been photographed in close - up by several spacecraft , whose primary mission has been to photograph @entity3			1
the first was mariner 9 in 1971 , followed by @entity274 in 1977 , @entity275 in 1998 and 2003 , @entity276 in 2004 , 2008 , and 2010 , and @entity277 in 2007 and 2008 .			0
