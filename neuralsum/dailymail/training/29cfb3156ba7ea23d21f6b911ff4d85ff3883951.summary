last saturday on the dot of her 11.15am appointment , a pretty young wife called @entity4 went to see the doctor at a small surgery nestling in a parade of shops overlooking an enormous , noisy roundabout in @entity10			1
the 25 - year - old was praying for good news : that her unborn child conceived five weeks ago is growing normally			2
half an hour later , eyes shining with excitement , @entity4 emerged onto the pavement clutching a scan picture of the healthy baby which will be born next spring			1
it was a joyous moment for @entity4 and her 24 - year - old husband , @entity21			2
no trust in the @entity23 : @entity4 and @entity21 were happy with their saturday morning scan and all thanks to the surgery where last weekend , and every weekend , the doors were open wide for business			2
it ’s open from 9am till 11pm six days a week — and from 9am till 6pm on sundays			1
on saturday , the gynaecologist at the @entity33 clinic in @entity34 treated 15 other patients as well as @entity4 , the last at 9pm			1
the previous saturday , he was even busier when 20 women came to see him			2
clinic manager @entity37 in one of the three dental treatment rooms at the @entity40 in @entity34 as @entity4 , a private maternity nurse with impeccable @entity43 , who is settled in @entity45 , said as she proudly looked at the baby scan : ‘ i think , personally , the @entity23 is rubbish			1
‘ they told me i could not have a scan until i had been pregnant for 12 weeks			0
‘ three months is a long time to wait			0
@entity21 and i had a problem with a pregnancy in the past			0
i could not bear the worry of waiting to know if i was expecting again and all was well with this baby			0
‘ i am registered with a gp in @entity54 where i live			2
but if you have an infection the doctors there hand out penicillin , which was on offer 30 years ago and has been replaced by more modern antibiotics			2
‘ once , i went there and the gp looked at his computer and used the search engine @entity66 to try to find out what was wrong with me			2
i do not trust the @entity45 state medical system			1
’ among the @entity43 patients at @entity33 were @entity70 , 25 , a factory manager and her partner @entity71 , 32 , an it technician			1
they live in @entity74 , @entity10 , and heard of the surgery through a friend of a friend			1
@entity70 is 25 weeks pregnant and the couple arrived just after 4pm for a scan of their unborn baby boy , due in three months			0
the couple had been worried because the pregnancy has been a difficult one			0
as @entity70 explained , after the @entity33 scan showed her baby was thriving : ‘ a mother is only allowed two scans on the @entity23 , at 12 and 21 weeks			1
‘ in our case , the first scan was delayed and it was at 14 weeks , which worried us			0
we wanted to have this one , at 25 weeks , to make sure all was well			0
’ smiling and happy , she added : ‘ during the scan i saw our baby boy put his fists up and wave his hands about			0
it is so exciting and such a relief for us			0
’ the @entity33 clinic offers a lifeline to patients forced to use over-burdened hospital casualty departments at weekends , evenings and night times because their gps no longer work out of hours			1
it has another branch in @entity108 , also in @entity10 , and will soon open up in the east of the capital			1
set up in 2008 by two @entity114 doctors , it has 6,000 @entity45 among the 30,000 patients on its books , all attracted by same - day gp and specialists ’ appointments that last half an hour and cost £ 70 — far less than rival private medical services			1
there are family visit appointments : three patients including children for £ 190 , ultrasound scans for £ 70 , injections at £ 30 a time and stitches done by a surgeon for £ 45			1
the surgery ’s motto is ‘ put patients first ’ and @entity37 , the manager , says the reason his doctors are so busy is that the @entity23 services are ‘ so poor ’			1
the facts are indeed dismal			0
two thirds of @entity23 patients now have to wait 48 hours or more for a gp ’s appointment and it is a rarity to find a local surgery open outside ordinary people ’s working hours			1
as a crisis of cash , bad management — and even the threat of entire hospital closures — engulfs our once - proud state health service , the sick are turning to casualty departments in desperation , and in increasing numbers , finding them over-stretched with waiting times of four hours for one in every 18 patients			1
in a few alarming cases , the particularly vulnerable sick and old have died in ambulances waiting outside in queues			0
mr @entity162 , 63 , ( right ) a sculpture and model maker for the theatre and tv and @entity167 , 35 , ( left ) a dancer working in the @entity169 , who are both patients of @entity171 a further problem for @entity23 patients is the waiting time to see a hospital specialist , because an appointment has to be authorised through a gp			1
the result ? some cancer sufferers do n’t start treatment for two months after they first visit their doctor with suspected symptoms			0
this weekend the @entity180 claimed some life - saving checks in hospitals for cancer cases are also delayed because of increasing @entity23 chaos			2
no wonder , perhaps , that a new kind of private surgery offering quick appointments at a reasonable price is beginning to flourish			2
in central @entity191 , the @entity190 admits patients until 10pm seven days a week and will stay open until 3am if an emergency patient needs treatment			1
@entity195 , business development manager of the @entity190 , also set up by @entity114 medics , said yesterday : ‘ we offer appointments in a short time and they are a half an hour slot			1
if the examination takes longer , we let the appointment go on			0
the patient is the important thing to us			0
now the @entity43 are coming to us too , as well as the @entity114 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208			1
‘ we are open every day of the year — the busiest are saturday and sunday when @entity210 ’ doors are closed			2
we have a lot of demand for gynaecology and dentistry			0
gynecologist @entity215 talks about his medical practice in @entity10 state - of - the - art : set up in 2008 by two @entity114 doctors , the clinic has 6,000 @entity45 among the 30,000 patients on its books ‘ we offer real quality and the cost is much less than many private medical clinics			1
we charge £ 60 for half an hour and if tests are needed we do them straight away			1
’ and back in @entity10 at @entity33 it is much the same story			1
i spent last saturday talking to patients there			2
from early in the morning until the surgery closed , there was a stream of men and women , of all nationalities including @entity43 , @entity114 and @entity238 , arriving for appointments			1
@entity240 , a 32 - year - old builder from @entity242 , was at the clinic with earache soon after midday			1
‘ i got medication straight away when i saw the doctor , ’ he told me as he left			0
‘ i feel completely confident with the treatment here and i am quite happy to pay because it is not too expensive			0
’ he first used the surgery a few years ago when he found a strange lump on his body that turned out to be a tumour — his life could have been in danger without swift treatment			0
‘ the surgery ’s doctors acted very quickly			2
they sent me for a scan and the op was done at an @entity23 hospital , which i was very pleased with			0
’ @entity70 , 25 , a general manager and @entity71 , 32 , an it technician from @entity74 at @entity33 the @entity33 clinic offers a lifeline to patients forced to use over-burdened hospital casualty departments mr @entity240 has an @entity23 surgery near his home			1
but he avoids it after a doctor prescribed antibiotics for his two - year - old daughter at dosage more suitable for an eight - year - old			2
‘ i was worried they would make her ill , not make her well , ’ he said			0
next through the door of @entity33 are some more @entity114 patients , @entity280 , 37 , a builder and @entity282 , 35 , an accountant , from @entity283			1
they did not want to give their surnames because their family do not know that @entity282 is 12 weeks pregnant and has been worried about her symptoms			0
@entity282 turned to the surgery , ‘ because the @entity23 casualty departments are so busy at weekends and to see a local doctor takes weeks ’			0
@entity280 adds : ‘ we rang to see the gynaecologist here when @entity282 was concerned about the pregnancy			0
‘ we asked for an appointment today and got it immediately			0
now the doctor has told us there is nothing wrong so we are relieved and happy			0
’ yet another delighted customer			0
but that ’s not surprising with the @entity23 in such deep trouble			0
one particular attraction of @entity33 and the @entity190 is that — mimicking medical systems in @entity305 — a patient can book an appointment directly with a specialist doctor without the often grindingly slow process of being referred by a gp at an @entity23 surgery			1
dr @entity310 the busy 58 - year - old gynaecologist who treated so many patients on saturday and who came to my @entity33 in 2009 put it simply : ‘ we follow the @entity114 way here — the patient can go straight to see a specialist without having to go through a gp or have lots of appointments beforehand			1
it helps to stop a patient worrying and he gets the right treatment fast			0
’ the surgery ’s manager @entity37 added : ‘ all patients want is to come to one surgery that they know and get treatment fast from a doctor that they trust			2
’ if only the beleaguered @entity23 could provide the same level of service — for all our sakes .			0
