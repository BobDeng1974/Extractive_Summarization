like many youngsters , @entity0 loves messing around on a piano			1
at four , she has already mastered @entity3 , her favourite nursery rhyme , an achievement of which her parents are understandably proud			1
but what makes @entity0 ’s musical ability all the more impressive is that she ca n’t see the keys – because she is blind			1
however her parents @entity17 and @entity18 were determined that the disability was not going to hinder her development , and introduced her to the piano as a toddler			2
‘ when we got the piano she was a natural , ’ said mr @entity23 , 31 , who works as a systems analyst			0
‘ it gave her a way to communicate			0
as well as learning to play the piano , @entity0 is also learning how to read and write in braille and already knows the alphabet her parents @entity17 and @entity18 were determined that the disability was not going to hinder her development ' social interaction is very difficult for a visually impaired child but this gives her something she can relate to			1
’ @entity0 enjoyed playing around with the piano but when formal lessons began a year ago she was more hesitant			1
‘ it was a couple of months before @entity0 gave it a go , ’ said mrs @entity0 , 30 , who gave birth to their second daughter , @entity40 , last month			1
‘ at first she would just listen or sing along			0
she has come so far in a year – she has absolutely perfect pitch			0
’ @entity0 plays in the garden with her father in the family home in @entity49 , @entity50			2
she was diagnosed with a retina disorder at the age of seven months mrs @entity0 , who works for charity @entity53 , said @entity0 now gathers the family round the piano so she can play @entity3			1
‘ it is definitely something that has helped her confidence , ’ she said at the family home in @entity49 , @entity50			0
‘ and the structure of lessons will help her with school work in the future			0
’ @entity0 has also been learning @entity64 for the past six months and already knows the alphabet			2
her parents are also taking lessons so they can help her through her education			0
@entity11 is a degenerative condition , though it is hoped gene therapy could help those affected in future .			0
