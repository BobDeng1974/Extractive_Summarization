@entity0 is known for its hot springs and northern lights			0
but now , researchers have revealed it is also the chlamydia capital of @entity6			2
while the @entity9 has high rates of the sexually transmitted disease ( @entity12 ) , rates in the @entity8 are even more alarming			1
since 1980 , rates of chlamydia in the @entity8 have soared compared to @entity6			1
and while the number of @entity8 with gonorrhoea has declined since 1980 , the figure for the @entity8 still eclipses rates of its @entity6 counterparts			1
@entity20 , shown in the diagrams under its former name of the @entity20 , had the most syphilis , @entity25 and gonorrhoea , while @entity27 was the state with the highest rates of hepatitis			1
meanwhile , @entity31 tops the @entity6 scale for @entity25 rates , @entity30 sits in the top five for the most hpv , hepatitis b , gonorrhoea , syphilis and @entity25			1
researchers at @entity39 used the latest data from the @entity41 and the @entity8 ' @entity42 ( @entity43 )			0
they plotted maps and graphs of @entity12 rates in @entity6 and the @entity8 , from 1980 to 2013			1
here , they reveal the most @entity12 - riddled countries ... researchers found a stark difference between the @entity8 and @entity6			1
graphs , showing the difference between rates of chlamydia , gonorrhoea , and syphilis in @entity6 ( left ) and the @entity8 ( right ) , show @entity6 has managed to keep the incidence of @entity12 relatively low			1
there was one spike for chlamydia in 2005 and increases in gonorrhoea and syphilis in the mid- 1990s			0
outside of that , there were no drastic increases in these stds in @entity6			0
what occurred with @entity12 rates in the @entity8 is more alarming , researchers said			1
gonorrhoea rates , which were soaring compared to incidences of the disease in @entity6 , declined drastically in this period			2
but the gonorrhoea in the @entity8 still eclipses rates of its @entity6 counterparts			2
worse yet is how much the @entity8 ’s chlamydia incidence has risen over the same period of time ; rates are sky high compared with statistics across the sea			1
the table shows the top five countries in @entity6 with the highest rate per @entity86 may be known for it 's natural beauty , but it also sits no. 1 on the top five for chlamydia , hepatitis b , and hepatitis c infections in @entity6			0
it is also in the top five for @entity34			0
@entity30 had the most top five placements on these not - so - flattering charts , showing up in five of the eight lists			0
@entity97 has the most herpes , while the @entity99 tops the hpv chart the table shows the top 5 @entity8 states by @entity12 incidence			1
the @entity20 - now known as @entity20 - is the place where @entity25 , syphilis , and gonorrhoea are diagnosed at the highest rates			2
researchers said @entity20 ’s own health officials have called its @entity25 rates ' higher than rates in @entity113 nations '			2
they pointed out the @entity20 ’s massive rates of @entity25 and @entity115 are linked to delays in treatment after diagnosis , a lack of testing , and misconceptions about susceptibility to hiv / aids the map above highlights which @entity12 had the most new diagnoses annually in a given country , averaged from 2000 to 2013			1
certain stds seem to rule certain regions			0
for example , among northern @entity6 and eastern countries , chlamydia was typically the disease with the most new cases			0
in @entity137 and @entity138 in central @entity6 , hepatitis c was the most frequently diagnosed std. in southwest @entity6 , @entity140 , @entity141 , and @entity142 , there were more new @entity25 cases than any other std. however , looking at rates per individual , new diagnoses of @entity12 – especially chlamydia – are still far less common in @entity6 than in the @entity8 the heat maps above show the changes over time in the rates of new cases of chlamydia and gonorrhoea per individual across the @entity8			1
notably , @entity20 , requires its own scale , researchers said , due to its very high rate of @entity12			2
peak rates of gonorrhoea in the capital were more than three times higher than the peak rate among the other 50 states			0
the @entity20 ’s @entity162 acknowledges a struggle of epidemic proportions with chlamydia , gonorrhoea , and other stds , as well as hepatitis and @entity25			0
the @entity8 ' @entity43 has attributed its success – and failure – in combating sexually transmitted diseases to education and access to healthcare			0
the research was carried out by @entity176			0

gonorrhea rates are still much higher in the @entity8 than in @entity6
@entity20 has the highest incidence of syphilis , hiv and gonorrhea
in @entity6 , @entity97 has the most herpes , while the @entity99 tops the hpv chart
