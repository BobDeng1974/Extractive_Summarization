everyone knows that stinging feeling when soap suds go in their eyes			0
but spare a thought for @entity5 who was left screaming in agony when the 99p shower gel he was using burned his penis and testicles			1
the 42 - year - old said a layer of skin was ripped off his privates while his manhood was left glowing bright red after using the @entity17 - branded liquid soap			1
he was in so much pain that even when his underwear brushed against the affected area he doubled over in pain			1
@entity5 was left with severe burns to his testicles after using @entity17 - branded shower gel he bought from his local @entity25 mr @entity5 feared being left scarred for life from the gel that he bought from a branch of 99p stores in his home town @entity31 , @entity32			1
he has now been given £ 1,000 as part of an out - of - court settlement			1
he said : ' it was the first time i had bought this particular shower gel , and chose it because it had the @entity17 brand on the front , which i trusted			2
' i had a shower to freshen up when i got home from work and suffered an horrendous reaction			2
when i stepped out of the shower and looked down at my groin i could see i had been burned			0
' at that point there was no pain but the area was inflamed , my penis was bright red , and i had lost a layer of skin			1
i was horrified and scared i may have suffered permanent damage			0
mr @entity5 bought the shower gel from a @entity56 branch of 99p stores in @entity31 , @entity32 ' as the area dried , i was left in incredible pain , with a burning sensation			1
i had trouble sleeping , and could not lie on my front because it was far too painful			0

' he added : ' i went to my local hospital and they said i had suffered burns			2
i do n't have sensitive skin and had never suffered a reaction like this before			0
' because i 'm self employed i had to go to work and battle through the pain , which was a real struggle			2
the whole incident left me feeling depressed because i feared my ordeal would never end			0
' after a month of applying moisturiser at the doctors suggestion it healed and , thankfully , i have not suffered any lasting damage			0

' i now get an even cheaper brand from @entity91			0
' 99p @entity92 suggested mr @entity5 ' may have suffered a reaction when chemicals used in his job reacted with the gel			1
in a letter to mr @entity5 , his solicitor @entity97 said that the company said : ' ... the chemicals used during the course of your regular employment may have caused the reaction you suffered when they came into contact with the shower gel			1
' by this they mean that ... ( normally ) the shower gel would not have affected you			0
' mr @entity97 contacted the makers of @entity17 , @entity114 , which examined the bottle and directed them to the supplier			0
a @entity114 spokesman said : ' a review of the product packaging identified it as most likely a product originally made for the @entity124 market and imported as a grey market product			1
' mr @entity5 said he is pleased that he has now received the cash but still wants an apology			2
a spokesman said : ' 99p stores can confirm a settlement was reached between the claimants and the supplier of this product			1
there 's no question of the authenticity of this product			0

@entity5 's skin fell off and he feared being scarred for life
pain was so much even his underwear hurt when it touched burns
given £ 1,000 *payout* in out - of - court settlement from 99p @entity92 supplier
gel was meant for the @entity124 market and came from the ' grey market '
it is believed chemicals in gel reacted with chemicals he uses for work
