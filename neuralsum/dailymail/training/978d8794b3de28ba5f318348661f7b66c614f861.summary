@entity0 and @entity1 are being investigated over allegations that they have fixed petrol prices for more than a decade			2
@entity5 investigators raided the offices of several major oil companies yesterday as they launched a far - reaching probe into price manipulation			1
they fear prices have been driven up at the pumps for millions of motorists			1
the @entity13 responded to news of the swoop by declaring : ‘ the lid is about to be blown off			0
’ the @entity5 fears prices at the pumps may have been driven up for millions of motorists @entity1 confirmed it was one of several companies in three countries being investigated the commission said it suspected firms had ‘ colluded in reporting distorted prices ’ to agencies that publish the data used to set the price of oil and petrol			1
@entity32 mp @entity31 , a long - time campaigner against high petrol prices , said : ‘ these latest allegations underline why action is required urgently in the @entity36			1
high oil prices are crushing families across @entity36			1
motorists are being taken for a very expensive ride			2
’ oil companies ‘ must come clean and show some responsibility for what is happening to the international oil price ’ , he added			0
motoring organisations , who have complained about a lack of transparency in the way oil prices are set , welcomed the probe			0
@entity13 spokesman @entity51 said : ‘ the aa has been warning since 2005 about the activity of speculation in oil and fuel markets			1
’ the investigation is reminiscent of the libor scandal , in which bankers were found to have manipulated interest rates			0
but while @entity62 pundits believe libor - rigging had little impact on ordinary people , the @entity5 said oil price fixing may have hit motorists in the pocket directly			1
it warned that even small distortions could have ‘ a huge impact on the prices of crude oil			2
potentially harming final consumers ’			0
@entity75 , of the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) , criticised the @entity36 ’s @entity76 , saying it had failed to take action after his organisation submitted a complaint in january 2012			1
he said the @entity74 raised concerns earlier this year about an 8p increase in wholesale prices between december and february that ‘ could not be explained by new geo - political issues or other economic factors ’			0
@entity0 and @entity1 admitted they were among several companies in three countries being investigated			0
@entity0 , whose offices in @entity90 were raided yesterday morning , said it was ‘ co-operating fully with the investigation and unable to comment further at this time ’			0
@entity0 said it is ' co-operating fully ' with the @entity5 after its @entity90 offices were raided @entity97 state oil firm @entity96 is also under investigation			2
it said that ‘ suspected violations			0
may have been going on since 2002 ’			0
the probe relates to the process used by price reporting agency @entity102 , which publishes prices for crude oil , petroleum products and financial instruments linked to oil			1
@entity102 ’ so - called @entity109 ( @entity109 ) method works by asking oil traders – some of whom work for major firms such as @entity0 and @entity1 – to submit the prices they pay to buy and sell oil and other products			1
the agency assesses traders ’ submissions during a ‘ window ’ of time , relying on the data to publish prices at the end of each day			0
those prices are used as a reference point , affecting the wholesale price that petrol retailers pay – about 47p a litre at the moment			2
that cost is then passed on to motorists , who currently pay an average of £ 1.33 for a litre of unleaded – nearly double the 71p it cost in 2002			0
a spokesman said : ‘ @entity102 is co-operating fully with the @entity5 ’s review			2
’ the commission said it was looking not only at false reporting of price information , but also at concerns that companies ‘ may have prevented others from participating in the price assessment process , with a view to distorting published prices ’ .			1
