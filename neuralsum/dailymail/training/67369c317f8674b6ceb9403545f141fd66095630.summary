' she 's seen falling , or slumping to the ground , remaining there for a minute or two before , quite clearly , the defendant and her friend come to her assistance , trying to get her to stand up			0
' and it is right , thereafter , the @entity59 , the defendant 's car , is seen to come , she 's put , bundled or half - carried into the car and she 's then taken home			0
