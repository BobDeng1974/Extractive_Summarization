by @entity0 published : 10:54 est , 4 june 2013 updated : 14:02 est , 4 june 2013 the @entity1 has admitted that the clock on its homepage does n't tell the correct time because it would take ' around 100 staffing days ' to put right , and it has taken the decision to remove it from the site			1
the confession came after a member of the public made an official complaint to the @entity13 's @entity12 ( @entity12 ) criticising the clock 's inaccuracy			1
he complained after discovering that the analogue - style clock in the top left - hand corner of the site ' merely reproduces the time stored on each individual user 's own computer whether this is accurate or not			2
' an analogue clock was added to the @entity1 's homepage during a redesign in 2010 yet it does n't tell the correct time			1
a member of the public made an official complaint to the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) asking for it to be fixed or be removed			1
the @entity1 admitted it was n't accurate but said it would take around ' 100 staffing days ' to fix the complainant added that the clock was ' inaccurate and misleading ' and readers would ' assume ' it displayed the correct time			1
it was added to the homepage as part of the site 's redesign in 2010			2
as explained in the report : ' the complainant said that there is no other piece of information the @entity1 publishes which it knows is factually inaccurate or unreliable			2
' the complainant believed that the clock should either be configured in such a way as to ensure the time was correct or removed from the site			2
' it continued that the complainant believed visitors to the @entity1 website would assume the clock was accurate and the fact it was n't was ' not consistent with the @entity56 requirement for the @entity1 to do all it can to ensure due accuracy in all its output			2
' the @entity12 looked into the clock complaint but ruled that the @entity1 had not ' knowingly and materially ' misled the public			1
the @entity1 has been told to fix the clock but can do so within a ' reasonable time frame ' the @entity1 was forced into an embarrassing climbdown over climate change claims made in sir @entity67 's groundbreaking @entity66 series			1
in the last episode of the series , entitled ' future ' , sir @entity67 discussed the challenges facing the region			0
speaking over footage of @entity74 , sir @entity67 made the assertion that ' some parts of the continent have become 3.5c hotter in the past 20 years '			0
however , figures from the @entity79 show that since 1850 global temperatures have risen by @entity81 , causing widespread concern among viewers			0
however , the @entity12 concluded that the @entity1 did not ' knowingly and materially ' mislead website users in this instance			0
the managing editor of @entity87 was quoted in the reported saying that making the clock accurate would ' dramatically slow down the loading of the @entity1 homepage ' and the work needed to do it would ' take around 100 staffing days '			1
following a request for a statement , a @entity1 spokeswoman told @entity97 : ' the @entity1 takes accuracy very seriously			0
' given the technical complexities of implementing an alternative central clock , and the fact that most users already have a clock on their computer screen , the @entity1 has taken the decision to remove the clock from the @entity107 in an upcoming update			1
' the @entity1 is governed by a charter called the @entity110 and @entity111			0
among other rules , the @entity1 is bound to report fairly , without political bias , and accurately			0
any @entity1 viewer can complain about @entity1 shows and editorial content online			0
the esc 's role is to act as the final arbiter on editorial appeals made to the @entity13			0
these include complaints about editorial content , including online .			0

a complaint by a member of the public criticised the @entity1 's homepage clock for being inaccurate and demanded it be fixed or removed
the @entity1 claimed it is inaccurate because it would take ' around 100 staffing days ' to correct and would make pages load slowly
following an *investigation* by the @entity135 the @entity1 has decided to remove the clock
