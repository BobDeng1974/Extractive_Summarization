by @entity1 reporter published : 22:21 est , 10 october 2013 updated : 22:21 est , 10 october 2013 @entity3 dust covering a more than century - old penny : that 's just one of dozens of stunning images captured by the @entity8 and beamed back to @entity9 since it first landed on the @entity3 in august of 2012			1
the presence of a penny on a $ 1.8 billion piece of galactic machinery might seem strange			0
but it 's actually tradition - the penny on @entity8 is a nod to the geologists ' tradition of placing a coin or other object of reference next to a specimen in order to scale its size			1
the incredibly high - resolution photo was taken by the rover 's @entity29 camera at a distance of five centimeters			0
@entity29 can acquire images of even higher resolution and can be positioned as close as 2.5 centimeters			0
however , because the photo of the penny was the first photo taken by the camera on @entity3 , @entity34 opted to not place it at its highest focus for the test run			2
a penny goes a long way : this 1909 penny currently is on the surface of @entity3 as part of the curiosity mission curiosity : the rover curiosity is the fourth unmanned rover sent to @entity3 since 1996			1
it landed on the @entity3 in august 2012 the dust covering the penny is not surprising - it was facing directly into a plume of dust stirred up by the rover 's engines during its descent onto the surface of @entity3 on august 6 , 2012			1
the specific penny used for @entity8 's homage to geological tradition also is by design			2
the penny on the rover is a 1909 ' @entity65 ' penny - @entity65 being the initials of @entity65 , the man who designed the @entity68 penny at the request of president @entity70 to commemorate @entity68 's 100th birthday			0
samples : the rover comes equipped with a drill that it uses to dig up soil samples and analyze them rough terrain : the rover is designed to be able to maneuver through @entity3 ' rocky , treacherous terrain the penny was first released into circulation in 1909			2
other images taken by the rover show the rough terrain of @entity3 and its dry , rocky surface			0
curiosity requires teams working around the clock to keep the bot up and running			0
there were concerns that with the current government shutdown , the teams of scientists monitoring the rover would be furloughed like other federal employes , leaving the fate of the rover in question			1
however , @entity8 appears to have received a pass - a spokesperson for the @entity102 , where the rover 's mission control is located , tells @entity105 that ' curiosity is doing what @entity8 does - she 's roving , taking some images of @entity3 , still sending those back ... right now , things continue on as normal			1

the rover curiosity has been on @entity3 since august of 2012
the penny is an homage to geologists ' tradition of using an object to scale specimens
the teams of scientists who run the @entity8 mission around the clock were not *impacted* by the government shutdown
