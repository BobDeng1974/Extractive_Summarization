a total of 6.8million parking tickets were handed out by councils last year – up from 6.5million in 2010			1
but a quarter of parking tickets are disputed , with 39 per cent of challenges succeeding			1
the rise comes despite a 5 per cent fall in the number of traffic wardens from 3,882 in 2010 to 3,693 last year			1
the findings come from @entity22 requests to 71 councils by the insurer @entity24			0

across @entity33 , a total of 4,124,561 fines were issued last year – up 3.6 per cent on the previous year			1
outside the capital , @entity36 ( 146,503 ) , @entity37 ( 138,558 ) and @entity38 ( 132,684 ) city councils issued the highest number of fines			2
this is based on a minimum fine after early payment discount of £ 25 outside of @entity33 and £ 40 in the capital			2
further research found that 51 per cent of motorists turn their backs on their local high streets because of the difficulties posed by parking			1
on average , 74,257 fines were handed out by each local council last year , compared to 72,367 in 2010			2
but the report says that as fines soared , the number of local council traffic wardens of ‘ @entity56 ’ fell from 3,882 in 2010 to 3,693 in 2011 – a drop of around 5 per cent			2
the busiest traffic wardens were found in @entity36 , handing out an average of 2,616 parking fines each in 2011			2
