ministers are being provided with thumbprint - activated smartphones to replace the traditional red box			1
for over 150 years , ministers have carried the scarlet leather cases crammed with documents their civil servants need them to read , and decisions they need to sign off			1
but now they are being issued with state - of - the - art @entity9 , enabling them to do their work online			1
@entity13 wants to replace the traditional red boxes used by government ministers with smart phones the innovation is being introduced across government by @entity19 , the cabinet office minister , who has become an early adopter of the modern phones			1
use of the smart phones will not be compulsory , but mr @entity19 said many ministers will prefer to carry an iphone in their pocket rather than ‘ lugging ’ their red box around			2
the red box is most commonly seen on @entity28 , when the chancellor holds it aloft on the stairs of no 11 @entity31			0
they came under attack four years ago when it was revealed that although incoming @entity38 ministers were being encouraged to take public transport , their red boxes were being driven home in air conditioned ministerial cars because of the sensitive nature of the documents they contain			1
with documents now being viewed in electronic rather than paper format , many see the red box as having had their day			2
one such politician is mr @entity19 , who has been cabinet office minister – in charge of civil service reform – throughout the time of the @entity38			2
he has announced plans to step down as an mp at the election			0
@entity19 ( right ) , the cabinet office minister , is pushnig the use of finger - print activated smart phones across government unveiling his new phone , the minister said : ‘ all my work emails are on this			1
this is my red box			0
‘ in the car on the way back i will be able to deal with two or three submissions just like that			0
‘ whereas with the old @entity70 , there were endless different passwords to get into it , with this – a modern @entity9 , opens up with a thumb print			1
you go into email , first thing that comes up is two parliamentary questions for me to check – i can do that quickly , it ’s done			0
i can do it from anywhere			0
‘ the cost of this technology is infinitely cheaper that what it has replaced , and its infinitely better			0
’ mr @entity19 said ministers in the @entity85 were already using the @entity9 instead of red boxes , as are ministers in @entity88 ’s @entity89			1
@entity90 posed with the most famous red box in @entity92 2010 - the briefcase used by former @entity95 prime minister @entity94 he said he hoped that other departments would take up the new scheme and eventually phase out their reliance on red boxes			1
all ministers have different ways of working – so we need to adapt to it differently			2
‘ different ministers will work in different ways ; some ministers will still want a red box and others will breathe a sigh of relief about not having to lug the bloody thing around			1
they ’ll be much happier with an iphone in a pocket			0
’ mr @entity19 said that if material was of a very sensitive nature , it would not be viewed on the @entity9			1
it would instead be looked at on paper back in the @entity85 , which has an office on @entity121			0
‘ if i have to see cybersecurity - type stuff , very high levels of security - type stuff , it ’s better to have one place in the @entity85 and i can view it there			2
’ the most famous red box of all , the budget box , contains the speech the chancellor is about to make , although on one occasion @entity133 used it to hold a half bottle of whisky for him to drink at the despatch box			0
traditionally , @entity94 ’s battered budget box from 1860 was carried , but wear and tear means a newer one is now used for the @entity31 photo opportunity			0
in late 2010 , @entity143 ’s wife @entity142 revealed that ministers ’ red boxes followed them in ‘ air - conditioned splendour ’ a chauffeur - driven limo			1
in may , soon after taking office , the @entity38 published a new ministerial code which said ministers should use public transport , where practicable			2
but within weeks it became clear that the situation was not all it seemed			0
miss @entity142 , the wife of the then @entity158 , revealed : ‘ the red box arrives unannounced at all hours in a chauffeur - driven car , the engine purring deferentially as her handler walks her to the front door			2
‘ my husband is free to travel home by @entity164 , taxi , bicycle or carrier pigeon , but the @entity168 must arrive in air - conditioned splendour , snug and secure in the back of a locked car			0
