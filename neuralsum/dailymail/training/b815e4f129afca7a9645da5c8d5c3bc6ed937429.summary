when @entity2 fans welcomed @entity3 to @entity4 and volubly expressed the hope that he might one day emulate a club legend , it was sir @entity8 ’s trophy - gathering expertise they were thinking of , not @entity10 ’s rush of blood at @entity12			1
but it was @entity10 , lashing out in response to the taunts of @entity17 fan @entity16 , back in 1995 , that came inexorably to mind yesterday , as reports emerged of @entity3 attacking a man on wednesday evening			1
the drama was played out against the backdrop of the emporium wine bar in @entity25 , housed in an old @entity27 chapel and styled on a @entity29 cafe , but it could be seen as the culmination of 29 days of rancour			1
the wine bar ’s website boasts of a relaxed , informal atmosphere , but that could n’t have been further from the truth at 10pm on wednesday night			2
@entity3 came from a meal with friends at a local restaurant and walked into boorish chanting and abuse			1
@entity3 was goaded by one drinker who accused him of ‘ being sh * t and never winning anything ’			1
others had their say , and the verbals soon gave way to crashing glass and flying tables			2
victim ? @entity66 claims he was attacked by @entity3 after an incident outside the bar the former @entity2 manager is alleged to have hit 23 - year - old joiner @entity70 on the side of a head			1
@entity66 was treated for concussion and a bloody nose after the fracas , but there will be plenty whose sympathies lie with the aggressor , not the victim			1
it is hard to imagine what it felt like to be sacked as publicly as @entity3 was , his perceived failure leading tv news bulletins as far as away as @entity87			1
that the @entity2 board questioned his abilities and found them wanting was humiliation enough , without well - oiled strangers - @entity66 was ‘ quite drunk ’ , according to a friend - now weighing @entity92 surely a decent man can expect to go out for a drink with his wife without running the gauntlet of boorish drink - fuelled barracking			1
but that ’s the world we live in and @entity3 must be aware that he has set a dangerous precedent			1
the wine bar barrackers are hardly likely to retreat now that they know his boiling point			0
indeed , the abuse will probably increase			0
it ’s a sad situation for this proud and capable @entity107 to find himself in , the more so as he reacted to his sacking last month - which must have felt like a personal cataclysm after being anointed as @entity8 ’s successor by the great man himself - with dignity and restraint			0
investigation : the former @entity2 manager is being probed by @entity117 police over an allegation of assault he once told me , while he was @entity121 manager , that his response to any defeat was to go home and draw the curtains			2
they will almost certainly be drawn now as he returns to the safety of his home			0
but even there , the man who thought he had a six - year contract at @entity4 to build his own team may struggle to come to terms with what has happened to him - both at @entity2 and on the streets of the @entity136			2
like many football managers , @entity3 has always worn his emotions on his sleeve			2
much less publicly , he is also a committed @entity140 and it must be hurting him that he so dramatically failed to turn the other cheek			0
belting someone , if that ’s really what happened , is a dreadfully unseemly way for any grown man to react to taunts , especially , it has to be said , a man whose downfall was cushioned by a multi-million - pound pay - off			0
wrong : @entity10 found himself in trouble after launching a flying kick at an abusive @entity17 fan in 1995 nonetheless , however out of character this episode was , it was always likely to be only a matter of time before @entity3 saw red			1
after all , he must be seeing red everywhere			0
he could n’t escape even when he took a much - needed holiday in @entity161 in the immediate aftermath of his dismissal			0
even on the other side of the @entity165 , he cut a forlorn figure			0
@entity3 was photographed running on a @entity161 beach , but even there he would stop to look at his mobile phone , apparently keeping up with events as they unfolded back in @entity171			2
he will not have been able to escape the disgruntled in the @entity173 area , where he has lived since playing for and managing @entity174			0
out and about : former @entity2 boss @entity3 with wife @entity175 ( left ) in december it is unknown whether his self - belief has suffered to any great extent			1
he is still the man who - the metaphor seems suddenly unfortunate - punched above his weight at @entity121 for so long			0
at 51 , he has plenty of time to bounce back			0
yet by the same token , @entity3 would hardly be human if he had n’t also questioned , at some level , whether maybe the naysayers were right , and @entity2 was just too much of a behemoth for him			1
a year ago , nobody , including him , knew whether the job would turn out to be a pot of gold or the deadliest of poisoned chalices			0
it was n’t entirely his fault that it turned out to be the latter			0
maybe it was n’t even largely his fault			0
low : @entity2 endured a difficult season under @entity3 and the manager was sacked after 10 months in charge there is certainly evidence to suggest that he was more sinned against than sinning , and @entity201 , who knows a thing or two about the inner workings of the club , has ventured this week that executive vice-chairman @entity205 should carry more responsibility for the disastrous season just gone			1
@entity3 would doubtless echo that			2
it must surely irk him , and more likely infuriate him , to think that there are people still in place at @entity4 who were at least as much to blame as he was for the catastrophic failure even to qualify for the @entity214			0
he is a likeable , decent , honest man , but intense even when everything is going his way			0
blame game : @entity201 believes vice-chairman @entity205 ( left ) should take responsibility for @entity2 's poor season so even before he fatefully went out for dinner and then on to a wine bar with his wife and a few friends on wednesday , he must have been a seething mass of frustration , resentment and enormous disappointment that , for whatever reason , he had not managed to live up either to @entity8 ’s expectations of him , or his own expectations of himself			1
it was this powder keg of emotions to which young @entity70 , in effect , set light			0
moreover , it is probably no coincidence that he should have erupted just two days after @entity237 was confirmed as the next @entity2 boss			1
@entity3 can hardly have missed the media coverage , and with it the conclusion , from the most seasoned pundit to the most naive fan , that in football terms , @entity2 now have a man big enough for the job			1
every list of @entity254 ’s achievements , every analysis of the @entity251 ’s supposedly huge personality , every assessment of his warm relationship with @entity248 , must have seemed to @entity3 like a personal rebuke			2
change : @entity256 boss @entity237 will take charge of the @entity259 next season			2

@entity3 allegedly involved in scuffle outside a bar in @entity25
former @entity2 boss allegedly attacked @entity66
@entity3 was sacked last month after just 10 months in charge
@entity2 fans will be *reminded* of @entity10 's *infamous* flying kick towards @entity17 fan in 1995
