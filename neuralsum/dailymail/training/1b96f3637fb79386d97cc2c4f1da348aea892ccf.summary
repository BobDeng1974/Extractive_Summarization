he also brands the @entity3 ’s decision to strip @entity11 , officially the @entity11 , of the title ‘ @entity34 ’ an ' insult '			2

the three - page missive reveals he was warned by the @entity3 to stay away from @entity14 while his brother @entity15 established himself as the new king the letter , which @entity45 stated was ‘ highly confidential ’ , reads : ' of course you know as well as i do , that it is for no other reason than for fear lest the attitude my mother and sister in law seem likely to adopt towards my wife may provoke controversy in @entity14 and adverse criticism in @entity12 , that i have been advised to postpone our projected visit to @entity14 this @entity61 , until after the @entity9 ’s and @entity30 ’s official journey to @entity63 and the @entity12			1
' in accordance with the policy of playing my brother ’s game , i have agreed to another postponement , but , believe me , for the last time			0
' @entity4 reveals his exile from @entity14 was all but forced upon him and his new wife in the aftermath of the abdication scandal			1
the letter continues : ' while the @entity11 and i have received the greatest courtesy in all the countries , especially @entity26 , where we have resided since our marriage , i have not lived out of @entity14 for over two years by preference			1
@entity15 , who took the name @entity21 , struggled to adapt to the unwanted role of @entity9 and suffered from a severe stammer ' i have remained away out of deference to my brother in order to leave the field clear for him to establish himself on the throne , which it is admitted he has succeeded in doing			0
' dispelling newspaper claims that he had set conditions for his return , @entity4 writes : ' i have never made any such announcement nor would i ever set conditions upon my return to @entity14			2
' regarding the two stipulations i am alleged to have made , i wish to say firstly , that while naturally the matter of witholding ( sic ) the title of @entity34 from the @entity11 is an insult which i as her husband and a member of the @entity3 have always resented far more than she has , we have too many other more important interests to worry over such a triviality			2
' secondly , whatever may be the behaviour of @entity29 and @entity30 towards the @entity11 , it would in no way affect any plans we might make for going to @entity14			2
' resentment : prince @entity4 wrote the letter to his aristocrat friend @entity8 in 1939 @entity4 signs off the letter with a stark warning : ' i need not stress the highly confidential nature of this letter , or the grave danger of the information it contains ever being traced back to me			1

@entity126 , a royal expert and author , said : ' this letter is a cracker			0
' it was well known that @entity4 was advised to stay away from @entity14 following his abdication but to hear it from the man himself is fascinating			1
' it is confirmation of the @entity136 muscle flexing that went on at a time when they needed to appear strong and in control			0
' @entity140 , of @entity142 - based @entity141 , said : ' @entity4 ’s abdication was the biggest scandal to rock the @entity3 in years and it was not taken lightly by his mother @entity29 or sister in law @entity30			1
' @entity4 was the first @entity149 monarch to voluntarily abdicate and it sparked a constitutional crisis , forcing a reluctant @entity15 , @entity30 ’s husband , to take the throne			0
