by @entity0 @entity1 : 09:06 est , 20 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:29 est , 20 december 2013 @entity4 mp @entity3 has provoked anger among her constituents after she omitted the word ' @entity8 ' from her annual card in favour of the message ' @entity12 '			1
residents accused the @entity4 politician of being politically correct and @entity14 , forcing mrs @entity3 to issue an apology			1
@entity16 said : ' i am shocked that she has employed an obviously @entity19 phrase , rather than a more @entity21 greeting			0
' @entity3 's @entity8 card which has been criticised for saying @entity12 and for being overly politically correct			1
@entity3 , the @entity24 mp , has come under fire from constituents for her @entity8 card which said ' @entity12 ' one pensioner told the @entity29 : “ i feel offended			1
in my 66 years of living in this country , it is the first time i ’ve seen our traditional @entity8 card abandoned			0
i wonder which tradition we will be losing next			0
” mrs @entity3 has apologised for her decision to wish local residents ‘ @entity12 ’ - a seasonal @entity8 greeting preferred by @entity19			1
she said : “ i am sorry if my @entity8 card offended anyone , and i look forward to continuing to fight for improved local services in the @entity41			0
' i have no hesitation in wishing all my constituents a very @entity8			2
' @entity45 was the name given to @entity8 festivities in 1997 and 1998 by @entity49 council to reflect the diverse nature of the city 's population			1
at the time the council said it was making the change to create a more welcoming , multi-cultural atmosphere due to the large proportion of ethnic groups			0
however , the move was widely criticised			0
the @entity58 , the @entity60 @entity59 , said it was political correctness gone mad , adding : ' i confess i laughed out loud when our city council came out with @entity45 as a way of not talking about @entity8			1
' resident @entity67 complained : ‘ she may as well have wished her constituents a @entity71 since that is the name @entity72 once used to seemingly marginalise use of the word @entity8			0
’ ‘ i would wish those who celebrate them a @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , to name a few celebrations , not @entity12			1
of course , unlike @entity3 , i have no problem in wishing all a @entity8 , ’ he said			1
the row harks back to the @entity45 furore in @entity49 in the 1990s , a season of public events over @entity8 organised by the city council - a move widely considered politically correct so as not to offend non-christians @entity90 , the @entity91 @entity24 candidate said the card was a “ nonsense ” and that several people had contacted him to complain			1
he said : ‘ no one can be offended by being wished a @entity96 or @entity12			1
it is a @entity98 festival and those of other faiths , welcome it as such			0
’ ' this politically correct , treading on eggshells approach does n't do anyone any favours			0
we should wish each other a @entity8 and be proud			0
' @entity3 in the 2010 general @entity107 mp has created a political correctness storm thanks to her card sent out to residents which said ' @entity12 '			1
it made no mention of @entity8 the greeting ' @entity12 ' may seem out of place in @entity21 to some , but in the @entity19 the saying has been around for decades			2
some say it dates back to the turn of the century , but more probably it came from the @entity122 song ' @entity12 ' released for the 1942 film @entity124			2
and it seems the greeting is gaining popularity in the @entity19			0
a recent poll by the @entity129 found that nearly half of @entity19 thought shops and companies should greet customers with a ' @entity12 ' or ' @entity134 ' instead of ' @entity8			2
' this compares to 2010 when 44 per cent of @entity19 preferred holiday neutral greetings			0
politically , opinion is divided over the use of ' @entity12 ' in the @entity19			2
over 60 per cent of @entity141 favour using ' @entity8 ' instead of ' @entity12 ' , while 58 percent of @entity142 say the opposite , the poll showed			2
in addition , about two - thirds of young adults , aged 18 - 29 , support shops using a non-religious greeting .			0

@entity107 mp @entity3 wishes constituents ' @entity12 '
angry residents say it 's ' *un-british* ' and *smacks* of political correctness
draws comparisons to the 1990s *winterval* furore in @entity49
