shadow minister for sport @entity0 was first to berate the @entity2 for not spending enough on grassroots football after the jackpot £ 5billion tv rights deal was announced			1
@entity0 said : ‘ these are incredible sums of money and it would be nothing short of criminal if none of the extra money goes to expand participation at the grassroots of football			1
’ yet it did not escape @entity2 notice that on wednesday — the day after the tv bonanza was secured — @entity0 was at the opening of a new £ 400,000 3g football facility in his @entity22 constituency funded by the @entity2 and @entity23			1
@entity0 criticised the @entity2 for not spending more of its tv rights riches on grassroots football @entity27 , whose pundits include @entity30 ( left ) and @entity31 , secured five of seven @entity2 packages in the new deal from 2016 - 17 at a cost of more than £ 11m per match it also emerged that the @entity2 had wanted their name added to @entity0 ’s quotes in the press release acknowledging the work of the @entity41 in delivering the project			1
but @entity0 declined the request , saying his words were fine as they stood			2
the mp said the @entity2 should ‘ live up to their promise ’ that five per cent of their domestic tv income goes towards growing the game			2
the @entity2 ’s answer is that , along with their solidarity payments , they already contribute more			0
but @entity0 insists : ‘ if that was the case there would be a lot more pitches and coaches at community level			0
’ the @entity59 will allow struggling one - day captain @entity60 to play in the entire @entity61 , for which the auction takes place next monday			1
@entity60 , who has failed to score runs in the @entity67 build - up , is fortunate to have the go - ahead from both county @entity71 and @entity72 , with whom he has an incremental contract , to play all the @entity61 when the issue has caused big problems in the past — particularly for @entity77			1
the domestic @entity78 starts in may , before the end of the @entity61 , but the @entity59 have relaxed their approach because it will be good experience for players ahead of the 2016 @entity78 in @entity83			0
@entity72 's innovative @entity60 will be allowed to play the entire @entity61 the @entity85 skipper will be available to @entity61 franchises at the tournament 's auction taking place next monday hollywood star @entity90 got a big hug rather than the cold shoulder from @entity93 @entity94 manager @entity93 may be avoiding talking to the media or aborting interviews if he does not like the question			1
however , @entity98 film star @entity90 was in the @entity100 room on wednesday night and received a rather more friendly greeting			0
there was a big hug , followed by the pair leaving arm in arm with @entity107 invited into the dressing room			0
@entity93 , a @entity109 ambassador , is understood to have met @entity90 while filming for the tv network			1
@entity93 , a @entity109 ambassador , is understood to have met @entity90 while filming with the broadcaster @entity94 , who need to find a new shirt sponsor now a mooted deal with @entity115 has stalled , have brought in former @entity117 chief executive @entity116 to head their revamped commercial operation			2
@entity116 in turn has hired outside agency @entity120 to help him in the hunt			0
@entity120 was formed by two @entity123 commercial executives , @entity124 and @entity125			0
however , using @entity127 sponsorship expertise does not automatically work — as the @entity23 have found with former @entity123 global sponsorship manager @entity128 failing to find a backer for the @entity131 this season			2
the poor state of @entity136 ’s @entity135 pitch ahead of their fifth - round @entity131 tie against @entity138 on sunday has not been helped by impoverished groundsman @entity139 having to improvise with a homemade snowplough put together from old pieces of wood			1
belatedly , @entity136 have agreed to new equipment and having the pitch relaid with the proceeds from their @entity67 run			1
the dire state of @entity136 's @entity135 pitch during their win over @entity149 at home on monday @entity149 ' @entity151 struggles with a bobble on the @entity136 pitch , which will be relaid the @entity59 , despite sacking around 15 staff , have invested in outside agency @entity155 to come up with ways of inspiring the team			2
the first collaboration is # @entity159 , which is only a marginal improvement on the bizarre # rise campaign for the @entity162			0
a promotion for the @entity59 's collaboration with @entity155 to promote the national team @entity166 ’s a red devil the sighting of @entity170 club secretary @entity166 mouthing the words of @entity117 anthem @entity171 in the @entity175 directors ’ box for the midweek game against @entity177 is unlikely to go down well with @entity123 fans			0
@entity166 , who arrived at @entity127 from @entity177 , has a strong allegiance to @entity117			0
so much so , former @entity123 manager sir @entity180 used to give him plenty of stick .			0

shadow minister for sport @entity0 criticised the @entity2 for not *channeling* enough tv rights money into grassroots football
but @entity0 did *n't* mention the league and @entity23 's funding of a new @entity191 pitch
@entity60 is fortunate to be cleared to play the entire @entity61 tournament
@entity93 gave actor @entity90 a warm @entity196 welcome
@entity136 will belatedly relay their dire pitch for funds from @entity131 run
