by @entity0 published : 12:44 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 13:35 est , 2 april 2013 spreading the word : the popular hook - up app @entity3 has gained a huge following among young @entity5 in recent months @entity3 , the hook - up app , has gained a huge following among college students since its launch last fall			1
now it 's finding a more unlikely audience : mormons			0
according to @entity17 , @entity16 's student newspaper , the free @entity14 app is spreading through the college like wildfire			1
some have labeled @entity3 the ' female @entity21 ' because it works in a similar way as the gay dating app. so why is it so popular among an ultra-religious student body where more than 20per cent of the student body is married by graduation ? perhaps the app appeals to @entity5 because it also has a clean - cut , polite image			1
the app works like virtual speed dating meets ' @entity35 ' : it uses @entity38 profiles to pair users up with matches within their geographical area , rating them based on shared friends , interests , and networks			2
instead of ringing a bell at the end of a seven - minute date , a user can ' like ' or reject a picture within seconds			0
they can only chat with people who have liked them back			0
otherwise , they can ' keep playing ' and scroll through more pictures			0
because it 's totally anonymous until both users opt in , the rejection factor is low			0
@entity3 has appealed to women in particular more than @entity60 ( the actual female version of @entity21 that was developed by the same company ) , because it offers an added layer of authentication via @entity38			1
this helps avoid the creep factor of an inbox filled with random emails from shirtless men posing in front of their bathroom mirrors , and filter out catfish			0
unlikely new audience : @entity3 is commonly described as a @entity21 for women , and is typically used for casual dating			1
now @entity5 students at @entity16 in @entity78 , @entity79 , are using it too but many dating apps targeting members of the @entity83 seem seriously heavy : one requires users to complete an in - depth questionnaire to generate a compatibility score , daters to list their thresholds and dealbreakers and offers a @entity90 personality profile as an optional feature			1
@entity3 , unlike a lot of other dating websites , is actually fun to use			1
it may seem strange for a casual hook - up app to become popular at a school known for its strict honor code : in 2011 , starting forward @entity99 was controversially suspended for the rest of his season for having sex with his girlfriend , violating the provision preventing premarital sex			2
but dating is a huge pastime at @entity16			2
according to official @entity83 dating guildelines , young people 16 or older should ' go in groups or on double dates ' and ' avoid going on frequent dates with the same person ' so that they avoid getting too serious with someone until they are old enough for a serious relationship			0
in other words , keep it casual - but nix the sexting .			0

free @entity14 app @entity3 is spreading like wildfire through @entity16 in @entity78 , @entity79 , where *55per* cent of the student body is married by graduation
