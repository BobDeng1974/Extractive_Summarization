by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 some athletes just refuse to heed the warning signs , to take notice of the directions on the road			2
some athletes just take what they can and keep moving forwards			2
that , in many ways , is the secret to @entity13 ’s impact at this @entity14 , the reason why he is now one of only seven @entity17 footballers to have played 100 times or more for the @entity19			1
prior to this @entity14 , the 33 - year - old had not played for his country since last year			1
he would , he announced , retire from the international game after this tournament			2
on saturday night , however , following the shoot - out win over @entity39 , @entity13 stood in the interview area at @entity42 ’s @entity41 and talked about his re-emergence as a pivotal cog in @entity26 ’s team , the striker turned left wing back who just never seems to stop running			1
‘ yes , it is new to me but i am enjoying it , ’ @entity13 smiled			1
‘ playing for your country , even in a role you are not accustomed to , makes you very proud and you just want to be successful			2
‘ we have the chance to reach another @entity14 final , so we have to give everything for that			1
the way i look at it is simple			2
if you want to do something , you have to go in the same direction as the coach and @entity26 is the perfect manager to make that happen			0
’ @entity63 : @entity13 with team - mates @entity64 and @entity66 in training cool , calm and collection : kuyt scoring his penalty in the quarter - final shoot - out against @entity39 @entity13 has only played three times inbrazil , but already he ’s covered the best partof a marathon			1
in his three games in @entity75 , @entity13 has run onaverage more than any other @entity17			1
he also beats any of his @entity77 opponents			0
average km per game : @entity80 11.14a @entity79 10.88 average km per game : @entity81 @entity82 10.30 @entity13 did n’t play in @entity19 ’s opening two games against @entity84 and @entity85 here in @entity75 and it seemed as though he would remain in the shadows			1
he emerged in his new wing - back role in the final group game against @entity91 , however , and subsequent displays against @entity93 and @entity39 proved fundamental to @entity19 ’s progress			1
@entity93 — in the unyielding heat of @entity96 — @entity13 was astonishing , playing in three positions and somehow maintaining his energy levels to win the corner from which his team equalised with five minutes left			1
that game was played in 38 - degree heat — many fans seated in the sun moved to the walkways at the back of the stands in search of shade			0
played on the anniversary of his father ’s death and a day that brought him his 100th cap , @entity13 seemed unfazed , his personal heat map so impressive down both sides of the field it ’s a wonder his boots did n’t leave two trenches behind			1
@entity119 : he has proved himself to be a key part of @entity26 's plans after not starting the first two games versatile : @entity13 vs @entity14 @entity123 : @entity19 highlights @entity13 is one of only seven @entity124 to win 100 caps : @entity127 van der @entity126 van @entity128 101 in the dressing room afterwards , team captain @entity130 paid his own tribute			1
‘ we have given @entity13 a very nice gift for his 100th international game , ’ revealed @entity130			1
‘ i had a little speech for him			0
i told him i am so proud of him and that he is an example for young and old			0
‘ there are only seven players who have reached this number and he stayed a long time , stabbing away on 98			2
it is fantastic , if anyone deserves this , it ’s him			0
’ typically , @entity145 devised his plan to use @entity13 ’s reserves of fitness , energy and professionalism as a wing - back as far back as early may			1
@entity152 : @entity13 joins an esteemed list of players with 100 @entity19 caps complimentary : he will be hoping to continue being the hardworking man behind the creativity ground covered by @entity13 in the quarter - final against @entity39			1
only @entity66 ran more for the team			0
leading up to the tournament , the player sold to @entity163 for just £ 1million by @entity28 two summers ago knew his time may be about to come again			0
during his six years at @entity168 , @entity13 ’s appetite for hard work was always apparent			1
there were others more gifted but few who made quite as much of what they had			0
against @entity39 , his contribution was almost faultless			0
this time it lasted 120 minutes and he registered an 88 per cent pass success rate and won 71 per cent of his aerial duels			0
then , just as importantly , he stepped forward to convert a penalty in the shoot - out			0
‘ yes , i was tired , ’ he reflected			0
‘ but you do what you have to do for the team do n’t you ? @entity183 does n’t come in to it after a certain level			0
the game is still going on so you follow it			0
’ even @entity17 football ’s most famous curmudgeon has appreciated his impact			2
‘ with @entity13 , you can , at a tactical level , go in all directions , ’ reflected @entity190			2
‘ when you have someone like him walking around , you are blessed			0

@entity13 has proved a vital *member* of @entity145 's bid for @entity14 *glory*
left out of first two games for @entity19 but has started the last three
has covered the best part of a marathon on the pitch so far in @entity75
one of just seven @entity17 players in *history* to cross 100 caps
