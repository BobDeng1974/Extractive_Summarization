by @entity0 vegetable growers hope celebrity chef @entity3 's star power will help convince @entity4 to cancel a 40 - cent - per - crate of food levy to be imposed by the supermarket to fund the @entity9 promotion , a charge that could cost farmers thousands of dollars each			1
the group that represents growers , @entity12 , wrote to @entity3 on tuesday asking him to step in after farmers expressed outrage at being charged an extra 40 cents per crate , on top of the up - to five per cent of the total cost of produce they are already charged to cover marketing costs			1
mr @entity3 's publicity manager @entity21 said from @entity22 that the chef was aware of what was being said , but did not confirm if the media personality had received the letter , reported the @entity27			1
' at the end of the day , @entity3 supports anyone who is prepared to help promote better food education and better nutrition , ' mr @entity21 said			0
' @entity12 public affairs manager @entity41 said some farmers were expecting to see a 30.5 per cent drop in profits because of the new levy			1
' growers around the country are furious at this arrangement , ' he said			0
' one grower will be paying $ 300,000 in this new levy , others will be paying tens of thousands			0
' we see this as essentially double dipping on growers and this is a company that posted a $ 1.32 billion net profit in february			0
' when you have that kind of money you do n’t need to be slugging farmers ’ hip pockets twice			0
' the levy will be used to help fund a new campaign from the supermarket giant called @entity65 mr @entity41 said @entity4 gave growers no warning this levy was going ahead and @entity69 were only made aware of it when farmers started coming to them			1
' they have not received any undertaking from @entity4 about what return they will see under this new scheme , ' he said			0
@entity12 spokesman @entity41 said growers were already paying up to 5 per cent of the cost of produce for marketing ' they were afraid of being seen as uncooperative and it would have impact on their business , and would receive fewer orders or be struck out all together			2
' but a @entity4 spokeswoman said it was disappointing that @entity69 had not contacted them because if they had it would have been explained to them that the levy was ' entirely voluntary '			2
' we could have explained ... how around half our suppliers chose to work with us on the campaign which benefits the whole fruit and vegetable industry and how participating growers are paying less than 2 per cent of the cost of a case of produce , ' she said .			2
