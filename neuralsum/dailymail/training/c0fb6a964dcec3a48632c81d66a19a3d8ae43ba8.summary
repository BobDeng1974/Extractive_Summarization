but whatever you call them new research shows they do n’t just make you look old , but wrinkles make you look angrier as well			0
researchers found that signs of ageing like wrinkles around the eye and a furrowed brow can change the way people interpret your emotions to think that you are sad or angry even if you are not			1
signs of ageing can change the way people interpret your emotions to think you are sad or angry when you are not the study found that stereotypes about older people could be to blame for the results , reinforced by tv shows such as @entity30 , featuring the grumpy — and wrinkly — pensioner @entity31			1
the @entity33 researchers asked test participants to look at 64 faces and rate their emotional state			1
despite all the faces being neutral , participants thought that the older looking people also looked less happy than the younger ones			1
to confirm their finding researchers did a follow - up study which had similar results			2
participants were asked to look at images of people who had been trained to make clear expressions of sadness , happiness and anger			0
they then rated the sad expressions on the older faces as more intense than the younger ones			2
stereotypes about older people could be to blame for the results , reinforced by tv shows such as @entity30 , featuring @entity31 researchers also found that there was no link between the level of sadness or anger participants though older adults experienced in real life and their ratings of the faces			1
@entity65 , lead researcher at @entity66 , said that wrinkles in different places on the face caused emotions to be misread differently			0
wrinkles at the side of the face may cause the mouth to droop , which could look sad whereas a wrinkled forehead could also make people think that somebody is frowning even when they do not believe they are making any expression			2
mr @entity65 suggested that this could affect how older patients are treated when they see their doctor , as @entity82 may mistakenly think they in more pain than they are			0
it may also affect how grumpy their families think they are as well .			0
