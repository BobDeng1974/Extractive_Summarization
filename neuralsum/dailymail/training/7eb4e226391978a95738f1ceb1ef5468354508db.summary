by @entity0 council bosses have threatened to rip up a pensioner ’s flowerbed – because she did n’t get permission to grow plants in it			1
@entity6 decided to brighten up the council - owned area opposite her flat with some wildflowers and herbs to smarten the neighbourhood in @entity13 , @entity14			1
after a string of angry letters from environmental service officers and a site visit from a senior council boss she was told to remove them , otherwise they will be ripped out for her			2
@entity6 with the council - owned flowerbed where she planted a mix of herbs and wildflowers opposite her flat in @entity14 mrs @entity6 , who has lived at the flat for four years , said : ‘ i just thought it was a nice thing for the residents and no one seemed to mind it			1
‘ most of the flowers i ’ve planted are wild so they are in keeping with the look of the area			1
i like to help nature along because it encourages the bees and birds			0
’ she said the problems began in september after a neighbour complained about a set of table and chairs she had set up in the area so people could sit out and enjoy the sun. but the council accused the move as ‘ intimidating ’ and told her to get rid of them too			1
‘ i put them there so people around the community could sit there and use it			0
‘ the council said i could sit there but i ca n’t leave them there so we removed them and put them in the garage , ’ said mrs @entity6 , who moved to the area from @entity57 in 1996			1
the area where the flowers have been planted ( circled ) surrounds a sapling on a strip of grass she has received five letters from @entity72 , head of open spaces at @entity75 , and @entity76 , its head of environmental services , insisting that she remove the plants			2
the most recent , from mr @entity76 , said : ‘ it is council land and there is no permission to exclusively " use " it for benefit , nor would permission be forthcoming			0
‘ the buildings were built without private gardens and open space provided as a buffer to the built environment			0
‘ if , when the grass team arrives to cut the grass , the plants are still there , they will be instructed to remove them			0
’ mrs @entity6 said : ‘ i ’m so disappointed because i ’m retired and my husband works long shifts so it ’s my little area of sanctuary			2
’ however , mr @entity76 , from the council has said that the authority is not prepared to let people use its land without permission			0
he said : ‘ the resident was told that it was a green open space and not to be used by individuals as tended gardens			0
‘ there is also clearly insufficient land for every flat to have a piece of the open space as a garden which is why it is open space			0
’ he added : ‘ not all residents are happy with the arrangement that this resident has taken upon herself - without any permission - and the council is not prepared to have adverse possession of its land			0
‘ mrs @entity6 has been told to remove the table and chairs and the plants and restore the council ’s land to its original condition			1
’ mr @entity76 added that mrs @entity6 was asked to identify an area she thought would be ‘ non-intrusive to other residents ’ and also told of the possibility of allotments in the area , however , he said nothing has been forthcoming			1
the pensioner has started a petition which 22 neighbours have signed in favour of keeping her plants – but is resigned to having them removed .			2
