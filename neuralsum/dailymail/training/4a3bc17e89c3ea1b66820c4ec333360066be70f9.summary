by @entity1 reporter published : 00:02 est , 2 september 2013 updated : 03:11 est , 2 september 2013 president @entity2 and his top aides began a full - scale political offensive on sunday to persuade a skeptical @entity5 to approve a military strike against @entity7 , but faced a struggle to win over lawmakers from both parties and a war - weary @entity12 public			1
the president made calls to members of the @entity17 and @entity18 , with more scheduled for monday , underscoring the task confronting the administration before it can go ahead with using force in response to a deadly chemical attack blamed on the @entity7 government			1
dozens of lawmakers , some in tennis shirts or shirtsleeves , cut short their vacations and streamed into the corridors of the @entity32 building for a sunday afternoon intelligence briefing on @entity7 with mr @entity2 's national security team			1
crisis talks : president @entity2 and vice-president @entity36 meet @entity37 and @entity38 to discuss @entity7 on sunday when they emerged nearly three hours later , there was no immediate sign that the many skeptics in @entity5 had changed their minds			1
many questioned the broad nature of the measure the president is seeking , suggesting it needed to be narrowed			2
' i am very concerned about taking @entity12 into another war against a country that has n't attacked us , ' @entity50 democrat @entity49 said			0
on the way out of the briefing , she said the participants appeared ' evenly divided ' on whether to give mr @entity2 approval			2
most seemed convinced @entity7 had engaged in chemical warfare			2
' the searing image of babies lined up dead , that 's what i ca n't get out of my mind right now , ' democrat @entity60 said after the closed - door briefing			2
but the credibility of the administration 's intelligence is turning out to be a less important issue than the nature and usefulness of the response			0
@entity12 military officials are using the delay to reassess which ships will be used for a strike , and which sites in @entity7 to target			0
one change was a decision to send the @entity81 aircraft carrier and its entire strike group towards the @entity83 to help support the @entity7 strike , if needed			1
earlier in the day , secretary of state @entity37 invoked the crimes of @entity86 and @entity87 , and warned of a potential threat to @entity89 a day after mr @entity2 delayed an imminent attack on @entity7 targets until after a congressional vote			1
debate : the president meets national security advisers to discuss possible military action contact : @entity2 called members of the @entity17 to rally support even as mr @entity37 took to the airwaves touting new evidence that deadly sarin gas was used in the august 21 chemical attack near @entity106 , the scope of the challenge confronting the administration became apparent			1
lawmakers questioned the effectiveness of limited strikes ; the possible unintended consequence of dragging the @entity12 into another open - ended @entity112 conflict ; the wisdom of acting without broader international backing to share the burden ; and the war fatigue of the @entity12 public			1
polls show the public is largely opposed to @entity12 military action			1
while mr @entity37 predicted the president would win the endorsement he wants , a cacophony of congressional critics - from liberal @entity123 to @entity125 conservatives - illustrated just how hard that will be			2
' i 'm not convinced that the administration 's support will resolve the issues in @entity7 , ' @entity128 , the top @entity60 on the @entity129 , said as he left the meeting , adding he was leaning towards a ' no ' vote			0
' in terms of whether not a lot of questions were really answered today ? i 'd say no , ' he said			0
mr @entity37 , the administration 's most impassioned voice for intervention in @entity7 's two - and - a - half - year civil war , was left to publicly defend mr @entity2 's reversal , a decision that puts any strike on hold for at least nine days			1
' this is squarely now in the hands of @entity5 , ' mr @entity37 told @entity149 , saying he had confidence lawmakers ' will do what is right because they understand the stakes '			1
split : protesters for and against military action confront each other outside the @entity158 call for action : protesters demanding military action shout over those opposing it at joint rallies in @entity164 in a round of television appearances , mr @entity37 declined to say whether the president would proceed with military action if @entity5 rejected his request , as @entity171 's parliament did last week			1
he echoed mr @entity2 's comments in the @entity173 on saturday , insisting the president had the right to act on his own if he choses that course			0
mr @entity2 is taking a gamble by putting the brakes on the military assault he considers essential to maintain @entity12 credibility , after he had said the use of chemical weapons would constitute a ' red line ' for the @entity12			1
the consensus on @entity185 is that mr @entity2 has a good chance of winning approval in the @entity188 - led @entity18 , but the vote appears too close to call in the @entity125 - controlled @entity17 , where the president 's opponents rarely miss an opportunity to block him			0
the @entity158 is due to talk with @entity17 @entity188 by telephone on monday , and mr @entity2 will meet the heads of several key @entity17 and @entity18 committees in person on tuesday			0
acknowledging that the administration has its work cut out , mr @entity37 insisted @entity5 could not ' have it both ways ' by demanding a voice and then abdicating responsibility to uphold the international bans on chemical weapons use			1
mr @entity37 used the television appearances to provide further evidence backing accusations against the @entity7 government			2
' i can share with you today that blood and hair samples that have come to us through an appropriate chain of custody , from east @entity106 , from first responders , it has tested positive for signatures of sarin , ' mr @entity37 told @entity220			2
innocents : according to @entity12 estimates , of the 1,429 killed in the attack , 426 were children responsibility : @entity227 agents say @entity229 's regime is behind the nerve gas attack in the @entity232 neighbourhood of @entity106 on august 21 it was the first time the administration had pinpointed the chemical used in the attack , which @entity12 intelligence agencies said killed more than 1,400 people , many of them children			1
mr @entity2 's efforts are sure to be hampered by his dismal relations with congressional @entity125			0
another bitter face - off on government spending is looming this autumn			0
lawmakers for the most part welcomed mr @entity2 's decision to consult them , but looked in no hurry to reconvene early from their summer recess , which lasts until september 9			0
underscoring a sense of wariness even from mr @entity2 's traditional allies , many @entity188 joined @entity125 in saying the use - of - force resolution offered by the @entity158 is too broad and that new language will be written for consideration			0
several said they wanted it to include strict time limits , guarantee that no @entity12 troops would be sent into @entity7 , and tie authorization for any further military action to additional chemical weapons use by @entity7 's president , @entity229			1
' the president said this is going to be limited			0
yet that 's an open - ended authorization to just about do anything he wants , ' @entity188 senator @entity264 said			0
' the resolution as it is right now is so open - ended that it gives a blanket authority with no time limits			0
you ca n't accept it just on its face , ' @entity125 @entity270 said			0
' now we have to look at what is the exit strategy if we do a strike , and i do n't know if we 're going to do that			0
' @entity281 @entity125 @entity280 said it was unclear if lawmakers would sign off on an attack on @entity7 , but he warned mr @entity2 may have to overcome ' the isolationist wing ' of the @entity125 to prevail			2
pressing issue : the president briefs senior advisers about the situation in @entity7 seeking to lay the groundwork for what is expected to be a heated congressional debate , mr @entity37 tipped his hand on one administration tactic - linking the vote to safeguarding @entity12 ally @entity89 from the @entity7 chemical weapons threat			1
' i do n't think they will want to vote , ultimately , to put @entity89 at risk , ' mr @entity37 said			2
lawmakers of both major political parties recognize how important it is to be seen as defenders of @entity89 , especially at election time .			0

lawmakers cut short vacation to join intelligence briefing
most agree regime did use chemical weapons but are split on resolution
@entity37 *likens* @entity229 to @entity86 and @entity87 for attack that killed 1,400
polls show public is mainly opposed to strike
@entity81 and entire strike group *redirected* to help if needed
