a rare first - hand account of the @entity1 - where 150 soldiers successfully fought off 4,000 @entity4 warriors , has gone on display for the first time			1
written by one of the @entity10 heroes on a tiny scrap of paper , it is thought to be the earliest account of the battle which was immortalised in the 1964 film @entity4 , starring @entity16 and @entity17			1
assistant commissary officer ( @entity19 ) @entity21 's letter to his friend captain @entity22 at @entity23 , describes how he and a vastly outnumbered group of soldiers successfully defended their missionary outpost at @entity1 in @entity27			1
@entity36 was later recommended for the @entity37 for his role in the heroic stand			0
he wrote that , within just two hours of receiving word that 4,000 @entity4 warriors were heading towards them , the soldiers had managed fortified their tiny stronghold with grain biscuit boxes			1
soon the @entity4 were attacking ' determinedly on all sides			1
' assistant commissary officer @entity21 's letter to his friend captain @entity22 at @entity23 is on display at @entity48 of the @entity49 in it he describes how he and a vastly outnumbered group of soldiers successfully defended their missionary outpost at @entity1 in @entity27 the invading army drove the troops out of the hospital , killed its patients and set it alight			1

the letter , which was bought by @entity48 of the @entity49 , was hand written from @entity1 less than 24 hours after the battle on a chit for bags of mealie			1
he also describes how , after the @entity4 killed 1,500 @entity10 soldiers of the @entity74 , @entity75 at @entity76 , they headed to the outpost at @entity1 , quickly surrounding the troops			1

we had got about 2 hours notice and fortified the place with trap of grain biscuit boxes & c. they came on most determinedly on all sides			0
they drove our fellows out of the @entity104 , killed the patients and burned the place			0
they made several attempts to storm us but the soldiers ( @entity109 of 24th under @entity110 ) kept up such a steady killing fire that they were driven back each time			2
