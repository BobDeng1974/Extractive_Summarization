a hush fell over the @entity1 last week as severely disabled crossbench peer @entity2 revealed her fears over plans to give some terminally ill people the right to die			1
speaking at times only with the aid of a respirator and the help of an assistant , @entity12 , who suffers from severe spinal muscular atrophy , spelt out her opposition to the @entity15			2
this is an edited version of her speech			2
' we have been told time and again that disabled people with life - limiting conditions have nothing to fear from the @entity15			1
we are told it is necessary only to help a few desperate individuals to end their lives when they have weeks or months to live , and that , if enacted , it will not touch anyone who does not want it			2
i do not believe that			2
disabled and terminally people are rightly frightened that it puts them at risk			1
one of the most important reasons why i oppose the @entity35 is the definition of terminal illness and how many months , weeks or years we have to live			1
believe me , i know about terminal illness , personally and professionally			1
that could apply to many disabilities , my own included			2
not a single organisation of disabled or terminally ill people is actively campaigning for this legislation			1
they all agree that it is impossible to create clear blue water between disability and terminal illness and as regards how many months until one might die			1
the definition of terminal illness in the @entity35 is ‘ an inevitably progressive condition which can not be reversed by treatment ( a “ terminal illness ” ) ’ , from which the person ‘ is reasonably expected to die within six months ’			1
the @entity35 adds : ‘ treatment which only relieves the symptoms of an inevitably progressive condition temporarily is not to be regarded as treatment which can reverse that condition			1
’ @entity2 told the @entity1 ' disabled and terminally people are rightly frightened that it ( the bill ) puts them at risk ' the brain , eyes , lungs , kidneys , pancreas , joints and nerves can all be subject to ‘ inevitably progressive ’ conditions deteriorating at widely differing rates			1
various forms of cancer , heart disease and neurological conditions can fit the criteria for ‘ inevitably progressive ’ at some stages			1
it would take only a chest infection or a small change in my muscle capacity for me to be put at risk			1
the catch - all of six months sends the invidious message that once you are down , you are on your way out			2
for any newly diagnosed individual , it allows the early seeds of fear to be sown , perhaps by the individual , perhaps by family and friends , or perhaps both			2
words of hope will have to compete against advice to shop around for a doctor willing to give a prognosis of six months or less			2
as someone who has come close to death on several occasions , i know how essential it is to have a positive outlook			2
there are times when one believes that one is going to die			0
that can be for weeks or even months			0
when and if you get through that period and if , as in my case , a new ventilation system is suddenly developed , you get better again			0
perhaps you have a week , a month or , as in my case , you have another two years			0
however , during the weary low period when everyone expects you are going to die , you could easily take advantage of an assisted dying exit			0
other disabled and terminally ill people have spoken of enduring such periods for years before their spirits finally lift			1
people felt that they were going to die			0
they do not take out pensions			0
i do not have a pension			0
why ? it is because everyone was telling me that i was going to die			0
the @entity35 is a law for the strong at the expense of the weak			1
last weekend , i went to see the film @entity132 , a very engaging and honest biography of @entity134 and his contribution to theoretical physics			0
it closes with @entity138 speaking to a group of scientists			0
he had outlived his sell - by date by 52 years			0
he was often in the state of terminal progression , but he is still here			1
i was deeply moved when he said : ‘ however difficult life may seem , there is always something that someone can do and succeed at			1
’ i have lived my life according to that belief , which is why i am here today			0
we do not walk that path alone ; it requires everyone ’s optimism and belief in us			0
the @entity15 ’s supporters argue it will apply only to a very small number of people			1
that intention will be far better realised if prognosis is set with a much smaller time limit of weeks or , maybe months , but not six months			0
' @entity161 is a law for the strong at the expense of the weak , ' @entity2 told the @entity1 outside this building , there are people sitting in wheelchairs with terminal conditions saying , ‘ no , this is not about choice — this is not about me asking			1
’ they have often felt so low that they felt that they had no options			0
they could have taken advantage of this @entity35 , because they have a terminal illness			1
but people with terminal illnesses in the disability community say we should slow down and think again			1
we have to listen to them			0
do not tell me that this is not about disabled people			2
it is very much about us because we are the people with experience of these issues			0
many of those campaigning for this measure have not experienced these issues			0
they are people in control of their lives			0
they are people who fear becoming what they see us as			0

@entity2 says the bill frightens the disabled and terminally ill
opposes the @entity35 because of the definition of terminal illness
defines it as ‘ inevitably progressive condition which can not be reversed
says it would only take a small change in her condition to be at risk
the @entity35 is a law for the strong at the expense of the weak , she said
