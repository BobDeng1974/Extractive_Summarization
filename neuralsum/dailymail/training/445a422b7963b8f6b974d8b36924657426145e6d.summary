@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of @entity5 fixtures , as well as intriguing statistics from the @entity7			0
1 ) the dramatic @entity9 equaliser that followed the dismissal of @entity11 was a reminder that the depth of @entity15 ’s squad remains to be tested			1
he was one of seven players in the side that lined up at @entity19 who have started every @entity5 game this season , while @entity23 has missed only one match			1
@entity25 was ever present before this game , while @entity27 has missed just two			2
@entity11 , one of seven @entity15 players to have started every game , was sent off against @entity9 manager @entity30 has given starts to just 16 players in total , compared to the 23 used so far by biggest title rivals @entity34			1
if @entity15 want to match the achievements of @entity38 ’s 2003 - 4 @entity37 they ca n’t afford too many suspensions			1
the legendary @entity41 side had nine players who appeared in more than 30 @entity5 games			0
2 ) @entity44 need to start talking to midfielder @entity45 about a new contract or risk losing the midfielder for nothing when his current deal expires next summer			1
the 25 - year - old has struggled to break into @entity54 ’s first team , but after playing his part in the 8 - 0 destruction of @entity57 was again excellent in the win over @entity59			2
in the 62 minutes before he was subbed after taking a knock he ’d found a team mate with 38 of his 40 passes , and covered more ground ( 5.0 miles ) than any other @entity44 player			2
@entity44 midfielder @entity45 , pictured in action against @entity59 , has impressed in his last two outings 3 ) letting @entity70 move up the road to @entity72 for nothing always seemed an odd bit of business by @entity57 , and the flame haired midfielder continues to be one of @entity79 ’s key players			1
any of the quarter - backs playing in sunday ’s @entity82 game at @entity83 would have appreciated the pass he hit for @entity87 ’s goal seven seconds after half time at @entity88			1
and @entity70 , described earlier this season by @entity90 as the ‘ ginger @entity91 ’ , continued to be an unsung hero in the @entity95 ’s 2 - 1 win , only once failing to find a team mate with a pass in the entire 90 minutes			1
@entity72 midfielder @entity70 challenges @entity88 wideman @entity98 during the @entity99 2 - 1 win 4 ) @entity101 might not be the world ’s greatest centre back with the ball at his feet , but when it comes to courage the @entity107 international is never found wanting			1
the 31 - year - old set the tone early in the game for @entity111 ’s committed defending against @entity34 by getting hit in a defensive wall without flinching			2
he went on to make three more equally brave blocks , won 100 per cent of his heading duels , and his 12 clearances were as many as the rest of @entity111 ’ defence put together			0
@entity111 defender @entity101 makes a courageous challenge to deny @entity34 frontman @entity120 5 ) @entity121 is the young man you want when there ’s a crucial penalty to be taken – as he proved by slotting away @entity127 ’s injury time equaliser against @entity128			1
the striker has never failed to score from 12 yards , and insisted on keeping spot kick duties despite the arrival in the summer of midfielder @entity132 – who took them successfully for both @entity57 and @entity134			2
he ’s justified that with three now among his eight goals this campaign – and also scored a crucial one that helped @entity140 ’s under 21 side qualify for next summer ’s @entity142 finals			0
@entity127 striker @entity121 is yet to miss from the penalty spot and netted against @entity128 6 ) winger @entity144 has been @entity145 ’s super-sub all season , appearing in all but one of their @entity5 matches but never getting more than 25 minutes			1
that finally changed when he got his first @entity5 start against @entity151 , and the 25 - year - old @entity153 international made the most of the chance			0
his pace – only @entity156 recorded a quicker top speed than his 20.5mph - made him a constant threat , and he laid on the chance for @entity162 ’s second goal in the 2 - 0 win			2
@entity144 has appeared in all but one of @entity145 's games but has yet to play more than 25 minutes 7 ) @entity167 boss @entity166 needs to get his strikers firing – of the four forwards on his books only @entity171 has hit the target in the @entity142 with the princely sum of one goal			0
when @entity176 gave the @entity177 the lead against @entity179 it was the eighth of the club ’s last nine to be scored by a defender – making it all the more annoying when former @entity167 frontman @entity182 grabbed an equaliser			0
8 ) @entity184 has always prided himself on the resilience of his teams , but his @entity188 side have suddenly developed an inability to hang on to a lead			0
in the last four games they have let nine points slip away from winning positions , and the latest came when @entity195 struck twice to help @entity196 recover from being 2 - 0 down at @entity197			0
@entity167 defender @entity176 ( right ) is congratulated by his team - mates after scoring against @entity179 9 ) @entity200 ’s rookie boss @entity199 raised eyebrows in the summer when he brought in five players aged over 30 as part of an overhaul of the club ’s squad that saw 17 leave and 14 new arrivals			1
the former @entity211 midfielder ’s trust in signing senior pros in an era when most clubs just want young prospects with a resale value is working pretty well			0
their 1 - 0 success at @entity219 , achieved when on loan @entity221 winger @entity220 converted a last minute penalty , was his team ’s sixth win in a row and took them into third place in @entity229			1
10 ) @entity230 has a career average of a goal every three games , which is not bad for a 39 - year - old with 766 senior appearances behind him , stretching right back to when he made his debut for @entity238 in november 1994			0
he remains as consistent as ever			0
his strike that earned @entity240 a 1 - 1 draw at @entity242 in @entity243 was his fifth in 15 @entity5 appearances this season			0
@entity240 and @entity247 striker @entity230 , now 39 , has a career average of a goal every three games			0

@entity15 's squad yet to be tested - seven players have started every game
@entity44 midfielder @entity45 has impressed in his last two matches
@entity70 remains @entity72 's ' unsung hero ' after win over @entity88
@entity121 is yet to miss from the penalty spot for @entity127
