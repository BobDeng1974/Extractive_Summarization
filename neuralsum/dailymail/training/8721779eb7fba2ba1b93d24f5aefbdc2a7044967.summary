health food giant @entity0 has been attacked by race equality charities for selling a £ 9.99 cream which claims to make skin whiter			1
the @entity4 is stocked in a number of the retailer 's 620 @entity7 stores and is listed on its website			2
the label insists it is for sun damage , spots and freckles - but its sale was criticised by campaigners , who claimed it was a throwback to ideas about lighter skin signifying higher social class			1
controversial : @entity0 is under fire for selling a £ 9.99 skin whitening cream ( pictured ) @entity22 , the deputy chief executive of the @entity23 , has asked @entity0 to remove the cream from its shelves to set an example			1
' in 1930s @entity30 , if your skin was lighter than a brown bag you could go through the front door and if it was n't you had to go round the back , ' he said			2
' we have moved on since then			2
' it 's a shock to us that anybody , particularly @entity0 , would make anything like this available			1
' although i ca n't speak for this particular product , many of these creams have very questionable properties			1
' but our worry here is a more wide - ranging one about what it means to be beautiful and what it means not to be beautiful			2
' consumers should be able to decide for themselves , but my worry is that this is part of a much bigger issue that 's been impacting particularly on children and young people			2
' in @entity54 films for example there is a very active debate about actresses having to lighten their skin to appear on screen			2
' description : the packaging insisted the cream can be used for age , liver and sun spots as well as blemishes and scars - but campaigners claimed such creams are designed with ethnic minority customers in mind @entity72 , of the @entity74 equality think - tank , told @entity75 the firm ' clearly knows its target demographic and why they 'll buy it '			1
she added it was an ' insult to generations of work done to encourage darker - skinned people to have pride in their skin '			0
the cream on sale is made by @entity86 , a @entity87 - based firm which sells an array of natural products including coconut oil and snail gel			1
it does not include controversial bleaching chemicals or steroids which have caused other whitening creams to make headlines			0
instead it uses an extract from the common brown algae ascophyllum nodosum , which it says reduces production of the skin pigment melanin			0
the product 's packaging insists it can be used on age , liver and sun spots , freckles , scars , blemishes , discoloured skin patches and darkened elbows and knees alongside ' general skin brightening ' - a sentiment which was echoed by a @entity0 spokesman to the @entity75			1
commonplace : skin whitening creams with names such as ' white babyface ' shown on sale in @entity121 , @entity122 , in 2006			1
millions of people use them around the world but their existence is controversial to some the campaigners , however , claim that despite not being harmful to skin it projects the wrong messages about beauty			0
one customer using the dr @entity133 cream wrote online : ' i 've used this product for three months , once or twice a day , and my entire family has seen effective results			1
' i 've gone a couple shades lighter ... it 's organic so you know its actually doing something , unlike other products which just bleach you			0
' this is my second bottle , i got my entire family using it because it does n't just make you lighter , it gives you this nice glow			0
' a spokesman for @entity150 and @entity151 said : ' dr. @entity152 was developed due to a demand for a product which helps to lighten age spots , freckles and hyperpigmented skin on the face and body			1
' the core ingredient is a natural extract called @entity163 which is a brown algae			0
it has proven skin whitening attributes especially for use on age spots , liver spots , freckles , sun damaged skin , scars blemishes , dark elbows and knees as well as general skin brightening			1
' the rest of the formula helps to condition , protect and moisturise the skin			0
we do not use harsh bleaching agents			0
' the row surrounding skin - whitening techniques dates back several decades			0
campaigners say their very existence is a nod to underlying racism in society , implying that lighter skin makes people more beautiful			0
some unregulated creams have also contained bleaching chemicals such as hydroquinone , which some studies say have caused severe skin damage and unsightly blotches			2
three traders in @entity197 , south @entity198 , were fined £ 51,000 in 2007 for selling illegal skin lightening creams which contained harmful steroids			0
despite the controversies , whitening creams are still used by millions of people from @entity7 to @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity122 .			0
