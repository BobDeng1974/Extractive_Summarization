' whatever these things are they can run rings around us			0
my guess is some of the cases involve spirits of recently deceased people , ' mr @entity9 told @entity76			2
@entity47 was photographed beside some of the graffiti left by the poltergeist on the walls of the house during its four month stint at the home the ghostly encounters at the @entity39 property started in january 1998 when the poltergeist started dropping pebbles from the ceiling onto the floor , tables , beds and heads the residents were soon subjected to sinister words and symbols being drawn on the walls and floor in marker pens , scrabble tiles and pebbles			1
the first series of words that appeared in the @entity101 , ' skin ' , ' car ' , ' help ' and ' @entity105 ' - referred to their friend @entity30 who was incinerated in a car accident just a few kilometres from their house before the first sign of the poltergeist appeared			0
over the next couple of days the poltergeist cranked up the level of vandalism , causing serious damage - a cd player was thrown to the floor and destroyed , windows and glass cabinet doors were smashed by ashtrays and other flying objects			2
@entity9 and @entity10 spent five days and nights at the property in april 1998			1
' we do n’t know of anyone who visited the house and left sceptical			0
the poltergeist was pretty obliging by turning it on , ' mr @entity9 said			2
pebbles from the driveway would regularly shower from the ceiling without warning , while knives , small batteries , spanners , shards of broken glass and other objects would be hurled across rooms this is a collection of the items the poltergeist regularly hurled across rooms , according to residents ' i saw an object materialise in mid-air			1
i was chatting to a lady and she was sitting across a wooden table across from me			0
she was reading a newspaper article with both her hands in plain sight			0
' there were other instances where knives , bullets … whizzed past our heads			0
showering of stones also happened three times while we were there			0
' the messages on the floor and walls had a malicious flavour to them , but the thing is if it really wanted to hurt me … it could have embedded the knife in my back rather than hurl it past			0
' after four months , the poltergeist left as suddenly as it arrived and its departure is still unexplained			0
