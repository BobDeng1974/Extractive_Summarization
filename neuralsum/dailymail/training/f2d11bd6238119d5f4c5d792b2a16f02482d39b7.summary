by @entity0 published : 17:02 est , 9 february 2013 updated : 03:02 est , 11 february 2013 it was a victory over the censors the irrepressible @entity3 would savour for the rest of his life			2
the director never tired of telling how he and 50 vip supporters stopped the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) cutting a ‘ sadistic ’ scene of @entity10 whipping a topless woman from his 1983 romp @entity12			1
but now the author @entity13 , one of the figures who publicly backed @entity16 , has revealed that he duped her and her fellow celebrities into siding with him			1
controversial : @entity10 starred in the 1983 film @entity12 which features a topless woman being whipped supporter : author @entity13 , pictured left , claims she was shown a doctored version of the 1983 film by @entity3 , pictured right , to convince her to back the movie ms @entity27 , 81 , claims winner won the support of opinion - formers – including @entity32 author @entity31 and @entity33 , creator of @entity34 – after showing them a doctored version of the scene			1
she says : ‘ @entity3 sent me a video of the film prior to its release and i remember thinking it was on the verge of being exploitative but i did n’t think there was anything that should be cut			2
‘ indeed , i told the @entity8 i would be happy for my 12 - year - old son to watch the film			2
but i saw the film again some years later and i realised @entity16 had taken us for a ride			2
we had been shown a cleaned - up version of the same scene			0
’ she adds : ‘ i know some might think , “ well , that is just @entity3 the lovable old rogue , ” but i think it was a very regrettable thing to do			0
regrettable but perhaps not surprising			0
’ raunchy : @entity8 made cuts to the video release of @entity12 starring @entity10 and @entity59 ms @entity27 saw the film a second time two years after its cinema release when she joined the @entity8 ’s @entity62 , which vetted films for release on video			1
she informed the @entity8 of the discrepancies and the officials ensured the cuts they had wanted for the film ’s big - screen version were made for its video release			1
her comments shed new light on one of the most controversial censorship rows in cinema history			0
winner , who died last month , knew that a high - profile public dispute would boost the film ’s chances of being a box - office success			0
but @entity83 , the then secretary of the @entity8 , told him that without cuts , the film might not even get an 18 certificate – a rating that had recently been brought in to replace the old @entity90 category			0
the board ’s examiners thought the scene ‘ thoroughly exploitative in a @entity97 way ’ and that it introduced ‘ an unnecessary degree of sadism ’			0
but in a letter to the @entity8 dated march 9 , 1983 , @entity16 wrote : ‘ every person who was shown the film took the view that cuts should not be required for the x certificate category			1
some even took the view that cuts should not be required even for the @entity106 ’ however , other letters in the @entity8 ’s archives show that not everyone in the @entity111 film industry was impressed with @entity16 ’s battle to beat the censor ’s scissors			1
@entity115 declined to fight @entity16 ’s corner as he objected to the violent treatment of women in films			0
winner himself made no reference to his vip supporters being shown different versions of the film in his autobiography in 2004			0
and @entity126 , an associate producer on @entity12 , said he doubted @entity16 would have doctored the film for anyone			1
a @entity8 spokesman declined to comment			0
victory : @entity3 , who died last month , often spoke of his triumph over the censors who wanted to ban the scene			1

censors wanted to cut a ' sadistic ' whipping scene from @entity12
but @entity3 won the support of 50 @entity140 who publicly backed film
supporter @entity13 claims @entity16 showed her doctored version of the scene to dupe her into siding with him against the @entity8
