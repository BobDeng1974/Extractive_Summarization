he said : ' some of them will get a chance but it 's important also that we keep the consistency in the team as well			1
' if we change too much , it 's not good for the players who are playing			2
' @entity0 will be seeking an improvement on the display at @entity43 , where an early @entity20 goal was all that separated them from struggling @entity7			1
he added : ' i was a little bit angry because we had 20 very good minutes and then we started to be a little bit lazy and did n't work enough			2
' suddenly , @entity7 are a good team			2
we need to do the job for each other for 90 minutes			0

he said : ' i think @entity80 will bring their own game to the table			0
they showed a bit of spirit against @entity94 on friday night			0
