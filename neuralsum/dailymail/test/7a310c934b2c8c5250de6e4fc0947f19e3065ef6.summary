' i struggle to leave the house as i feel everyone is looking at me			2
i went out for a family meal and a male said to me are you the one who had your ear bitten off			2
i was embarrassed by this male 's comments			0
' i booked a holiday and i was due to fly ten days after the assault took place			0
i was advised on medical grounds not to go because of risk of infection			0
i paid £ 1,500 for the holiday and as i did n't want to let my children down i paid another £ 400 for my parents to go with them			0
' i have had to take a considerable amount of time off work			0
working in a call centre i am unable to use my head set equipment			0

' @entity1 was not prepared to let him in the house even though he was saying let 's have a kiss and so forth			1
she was not at all interested in that taking place			0
' @entity10 has seen the messages and got the wrong end of the stick which started this whole vendetta against her			1
it 's ironic really that all of this started by her being a good friend to a man she has known since she was a child			0
' in her own words her life has fallen apart			0
she 's made decisions whilst in the depths of despair which she bitterly regrets and she will have to live with them consequences forever			0
' she 's clearly a low risk of ever being in trouble again			0
an immediate term of imprisonment would crush the defendant			0
' judge @entity188 told @entity15 : ' she has been left feeling frightened and she has a permanent disability			1
she lost her confidence , she 's had her career affected and her home life with her children has been affected			0
' you admit in a letter to me you had her partner inside your house and had been kissing and cuddling him but no more			2
' you do of course have a completely different character outside of this event			0
you have no previous convictions			0
this is a single bite			0
' there is of course remorse although i take that as limited given the late plea and lack of cooperation during the case			0
' you must have known what you had done on this night and you must have known what injury you had caused			0
' it 's a significant injury and it 's caused by a weapon - teeth			0
' i ca n't draw back from immediate sentence leaving someone disabled in this way			0
