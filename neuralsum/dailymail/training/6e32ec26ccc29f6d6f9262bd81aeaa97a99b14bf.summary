@entity0 , whose body was found in @entity2 in @entity3 after he went missing the inquest into the death of a student whose body was found in a lake has been halted after it emerged his @entity8 was still working despite it apparently being in the water with him for three weeks			1
@entity0 , 20 , a criminology student from @entity11 became separated from three friends during a night out in april , sparking a massive search of @entity2 in @entity3 , where his body was found			1
it has also emerged that a mysterious man captured on cctv walking through the graveyard of a nearby church and then doing a quick u-turn around the time the student went missing has not come forward , despite police appeals			1
the inquest at @entity23 in @entity3 was stopped after the barrister for @entity0 's family , @entity25 , complained of too many ' gaps ' in his final hours and said there were ' unanswered questions '			1
mr @entity25 told a witness giving evidence for @entity31 : ' you 've got a blank spot on this and you 're giving evidence today which is completely divergent to what the family understands			0
' coroner @entity38 said he did not want the family to go away ' unhappy ' , but warned all the answers may never be known			0
@entity0 's mum @entity41 , 43 , told the inquest her son was good at directions and can not understand how he ended up on @entity45 , close to @entity2 , as it was in the opposite direction to the cottage where he was staying			1
she said : ' there 's still a gap and we are still adamant people have seen him on @entity45 that night and that @entity0 would have asked them for help			1
an unexplained bruise on mr @entity0 's head was also found during a post mortem but a small cut to his eye was ' missed '			1
several ' figures ' in ' groups ' on the streets that night have not been traced , a detective revealed			0
mr @entity0 a @entity65 student , had travelled from @entity11 with three friends on a spontaneous trip to the @entity68			1
the group ate and drank at pubs including @entity71 where they got split up around midnight			0
mr @entity0 's family pictured at an earlier press conference around the time he went missing			2
his mother @entity74 , centre , told the inquest she can not understand how he ended up near to the lake mr @entity0 was told to go to the toilet after being sick but the group got split up and he was last seen trying to get help at the @entity81 , which was closed			1
his three friends - @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 - estimated he had drunk around six - and - half pints of lager , some shots and half - a - bottle of wine			0
his post mortem examination showed he was two - and - half times the drink drive limit , which on its own was not sufficient to kill him , the inquest was told			0
while he was described as ' swaying ' , witnesses said he was sufficiently ' coherent ' to ask for help and speak to people			0
the last contact his phone had with the network was at 12.31am			0
specialist police teams and a marine unit searched @entity2 for mr @entity0 after he went missing following a night out with friends mr @entity0 had not been drinking regularly due to a fitness regime , the hearing was told			1
his cause of death remains ' unascertained ' - partly because of decomposition after he was found in the water at @entity110 , just off the @entity111 on @entity45 near the @entity113 museum			1
@entity115 footage from the museum showed the security lights activating around the time of his disappearance but there is no - one or any animals on film - which detectives can not explain			2
consultant pathologist , dr @entity123 , is also unable to explain bruising on @entity0 's head			2
he said : ' there are a number of things i did n't find and it leaves me with a problem ' although it 's not uncommon in drowning			0
' there was no definite evidence of drowning but that does n't exclude drowning			0
two possible causes are drowning and hypothermia			0
' detective sergeant @entity139 , of @entity31 , said the operation to find mr @entity0 was ‘ comprehensive ’ dr @entity123 said the bruise was not serious enough to be fatal but ' was caused when he was alive			2
' however , he added that the bruise could also have been due to his position in the water			0
but the @entity146 - based consultant pathologist believes there was ' no evidence ' of @entity0 being assaulted but said he was not a ' forensic pathologist '			2
detective sergeant @entity139 , of @entity31 , said the operation to find mr @entity0 was ' comprehensive ' with hundreds of statements taken and @entity115 footage examined			1
he said it was the first missing person search in @entity3 on such a scale in years			1
@entity155 said : ' has someone hit @entity0 ? i 've certainly not come across any material or any witness that suggests otherwise			2
' i think , having heard all the evidence and reviewed all the statements , the hypothesis which has the most likelihood is that @entity0 has been drunk , perhaps fallen over , and ended up in the lake and to do that , he would have had to cross a field			0
' floral tributes were left outside the @entity169 steamboat museum near to where mr @entity0 's body was found asked how @entity0 's body could have ended up at @entity110 , @entity155 said : ' it 's fairly common in @entity2 - it has a strong current underwater and various vegetation that someone could get caught up on , or then move around			1
' a mysterious man captured on cctv walking through the graveyard of @entity178 and then doing a quick u-turn around the time @entity0 went missing had not come forward despite police appeals , he said			1
@entity155 said they had spoken to who they believed the person to be , who had said he was at home on the night			0
after the inquest @entity0 's family said in a statement : ' there is no criticism of anyone in this matter			2
the issue is that , there is a gap in the evidence for the period between @entity0 leaving the ' @entity199 ' to the time when he entered the lake			0
' we understand that there is further evidence which was not produced at the inquest and our solicitor will be requesting sight of that evidence in the hope that this will provide a clearer picture of events			0
