by @entity0 last updated at 2:38 pm on 9th january 2012 a cargo ship grounded off the @entity4 coast since october has split in two , spilling sea containers and debris and sparking fears of a fresh oil spill , maritime officials said			1
the wreck of the @entity11 - owned @entity10 was described as @entity4 's worst maritime environmental disaster even before the rear section of the ship , lashed by pounding seas , broke away yesterday			1
the ship previously spilled heavy fuel oil that fouled pristine @entity19 beaches and killed up to 20,000 seabirds , and despite salvage efforts nearly 400 tons of oil remain onboard			1
the storm that split the vessel will continue for another three to four days , @entity37 spokesman @entity36 said			0
officials said up to 300 of the roughly 880 containers that had been on board were lost when the ship broke apart			2
of those , about 30 per cent had been fitted with monitoring devices and some 30 containers had already been located			0
the storm that split the vessel will continue for another three to four days , @entity37 spokesman @entity36 said environment minister @entity49 said there is roughly 385 tons of oil still aboard the ship oil has been seen leaking from the broken ship			1
@entity55 , on - scene commander for the national response team , said oil from the vessel could come ashore last night			2
' while reports at this stage indicate there has not been a significant release of oil , with the @entity10 in its current fragile state , a further release is likely , ' he said			1
' while it is unknown at this stage exactly how much oil may be released , teams have been mobilized and will be ready to respond to anything that may come ashore			2
' afternoon stroll : hundreds of bags of powdered milk have washed up on shore following the splitting in two of the wrecked cargo ship @entity10 clean up operation : volunteers have been helping clear up @entity79 optimistic : but for some the washed up bags have provided plenty of enjoyment beached : visitors point at a washed up container , as firemen walk alongside other debris on @entity79 environment minister @entity49 said that the ' risks for the environment are a fraction of what they were in october , ' though the roughly 385 tons of oil still aboard the ship is about the same amount that leaked from the vessel soon after it ran aground			1
salvage crews previously removed 1,100 tons of oil from the ship			1
most of the oil is in tanks in the stern section , which could end up sinking			2
some of that oil could end up dissipating in the ocean rather than washing up on beaches			2
the containers , meanwhile , spilled goods including timber , wool , bales of recycled plastic and bags of milk powder			0
the debris could begin washing ashore later sunday			0
some containers have been sighted floating up to 20 miles northwest of the stricken ship , @entity117 chief executive @entity116 said			0
' they have been caught in a strong coastal current ' fueled by the storm , he said			0
the @entity10 ran aground on @entity123 14 miles from @entity124 on @entity19 on october 5			1
salvage crews have plucked 389 of the ship 's 1,370 loaded cargo containers from its decks since it ran aground , while some 98 have been washed over board in the past three months			0
one eyewitness , @entity130 , said the rear section was sliding along the reef			0
the ' stern has reared up and center section is not visible			0
large breaking waves observed on bow , ' he said			0
clean up : soldiers worked to clear away the oil spill from the beach in @entity142 , @entity4 , as environmentalists warned of a potential wildlife disaster removal : bulldozers and diggers have been drafted on to @entity79 beach to take away the shipping containers in trouble : rescuers have been unable to properly reach the ship due to the severe structural damage it has suffered destruction : washed up container roll slowly up to the beach investigators were unable to explain how the vessel managed to perch itself on a @entity4 reef before the split a two - mile no - go zone is in force around the wreck			1
investigations last month revealed that @entity167 authorities impounded the vessel , but released it the next day after @entity171 maritime authorities intervened , essentially saying the ship was safe to sail and the problems could be fixed later			0
the @entity10 , like many ships , is registered in @entity171			2
some 10 weeks later , the @entity10 ran full - steam into a well - marked reef off the coast of @entity4			1
it 's not clear whether the previously identified problems played any role			0
the captain and @entity10 's navigating officer face criminal charges of operating a ship in a dangerous or risky manner , polluting the environment and altering the ship 's documents after the crash			1
other items from the containers washed up in @entity124 , @entity4 included these deer skins rescuers have been trying to get near the vessel to transfer away the ship 's oil since october			1
