@entity5 astronomers are joining forces to hunt for @entity7 – or at least signs of his existence			2
scientists from 11 institutions , including the renowned @entity13 , have launched a network that will help those working in different fields of research to share their expertise			1
telescopes will listen in for radio and light ‘ broadcasts ’ beamed out by @entity22 , radios , satellites , radar and lasers from other worlds			1
@entity5 astronomers are joining forces to hunt for @entity7 - or at least signs of his existence			0
scientists from 11 institutions , including the renowned @entity13 , have launched a network that will help those working in different fields of research to share their expertise and should a message from little green men be intercepted , we might be ready to reply			1
communications experts more used to working on intelligence of chimpanzees and dolphins are tackling how to decode any messages and put together a response			0
the network , which is being coordinated by dr @entity42 , of the @entity43 , was officially launched today at the @entity44 , organised by the @entity45 , at @entity46 , @entity47			1
the @entity5 @entity48 , or @entity49 , will bolster @entity5 ’s long - running involvement in the @entity52 - based , @entity51 , or @entity51 , project			0
dr @entity54 said that the interception of light and radio signals that are wholly artificial and could not be made by nature would be proof that we are not alone			1
he said : ‘ if @entity7 fired a powerful laser through a big optical telescope to send a signal or announce their existence , those pulses could be detected over many thousands of light years			1
the scientists , including those from the @entity13 ( pictured ) , have launched a network that will help those working in different fields of research to share their expertise			1
telescopes will listen in for radio and light ' broadcasts ' beamed out by @entity22 , radios , satellites , radar and lasers from other worlds ‘ it 's the same with the radio search			1
we do n't know if they are emitting signals , but if they were then we have the equipment to pick them up			0
we need to get more time on telescopes for the project and then we 'll get a flood of data			1
‘ at the moment if we detected a signal that was unambiguously artificial that would be it			1
you would n't need to understand the message - its nature would tell us that we are not alone			0
‘ then again once you 've found it then you can look more closely to see if there is a message			1
if it looks as though there is , then @entity100 can get going and try to decode it			0
’ others believe that that a new level of code - breaking will be required			1
dr @entity109 , an expert in human and animal communication from @entity112 , said : ‘ standard decipherment and decryption techniques used by the military and security agencies are not going to help much			1
some scientists argue that if @entity7 has the technology to cross space to reach us , any defences we have will be all but useless			1
@entity122 ( pictured ) has warned that aliens may plunder @entity124 for its resources			0
but not everyone is convinced that the threat is real ‘ to put the challenge into context , we still have scripts from antiquity that have remained undeciphered over hundreds of years , despite many serious attempts			1
’ however , scientists are divided about whether we should be should advertise our presence by responding to any message			1
some say that if we alert hostile aliens to our existence we risk an invasion that could lead to the end of life on @entity124			0
they argue that if @entity7 has the technology to cross space to reach us any defences we have will be all but useless			0
@entity122 has warned that aliens may plunder @entity124 for its resources			0
but not everyone is convinced that the threat is real			0
spaceships : @entity148 believes she saw alien life while living in @entity150 it is an admission that might not have been too surprising if she were still hooked on drink and drugs			0
but @entity148 had given up both at the time she claims to have seen alien spaceships			0
the @entity159 singer says she made her sightings when she was living in @entity161 , @entity150			0
miss @entity148 , 65 , said : ‘ i lived for a while underneath the famous @entity163 in @entity161 and i would sit outside and see white floating objects – a lot of them obviously aeroplanes – up in the sky			2
' i used to call it the @entity171 because there are just spaceships being reported in that area all the time up there			0
‘ it ’s just like an episode of @entity177 sometimes			2
i ’m sure that somewhere within the real aeroplanes i saw alien spaceships too			0
‘ it was that creepy			2
i ’d given up alcohol , and drugs , so seeing little green men in spaceships probably was n’t a good idea for me			0
’ miss @entity148 , who says she feels healthier than she has in 30 years , also believes that she was a @entity185 woman in a concentration camp in a previous life			2
@entity159 ’s world tour arrives in the @entity5 in september			0
the new network will capitalise on existing funding for space projects , although some extra cash may be needed for new research professor @entity194 , of @entity195 , told the conference that any aliens ‘ would have made themselves known by now ’			1
the network will capitalise on existing funding for space projects , although some extra cash may be needed for new research			2
dr @entity202 , of the @entity45 , said : ‘ if we found even one civilisation elsewhere , it would be an entirely sensational result			2
‘ it is just so interesting that it would be a shame not to do it just a little bit because the consequences could be extraordinary			2

scientists from 11 institutions , including the renowned @entity13 , have launched a network so scientists can share expertise
will help scientists researching different fields share their expertise
telescopes will listen in for radio and light ‘ broadcasts ’ beamed out by @entity22 , radios , satellites , radar and lasers from other worlds
