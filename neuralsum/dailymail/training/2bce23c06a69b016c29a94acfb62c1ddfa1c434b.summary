it does not get any bigger , better or tougher than playing the @entity1			1
it tests every part of your being ; physically , mentally , emotionally and , maybe even , spiritually			0
if you have a weakness they will identify it and exploit it			0
there are no hiding places			0
i loved playing the @entity1 and hated playing the @entity1 in equal measure			1
i loved it because it was the ultimate challenge and stretched you to be everything you could possibly be			0
i hated it because they were so good and there was always the chance that you could get an absolute hiding			0
i played against the @entity1 more than i did against @entity22 and @entity23 combined just because we always toured there every four years or so			2
we did this because the likes of @entity28 and @entity29 felt it was the best place for @entity31 to tour due to the amount we could learn from playing rugby in a country like @entity1			1
@entity35 ( centre ) knows what is like to face @entity1 having played them seven times in his career @entity41 tasted victory against the @entity1 once when turning out for a world xv former @entity31 captain @entity41 ( right ) said there is nowhere to hide against @entity1 a lot of @entity47 are descended from @entity31 , the climate is very similar but , sadly , they have always been slightly better than us at rugby			1
@entity29 says that he thinks @entity47 are just @entity51 that have learnt how to win ! i do know what it feels like to beat the @entity1 though			1
i was lucky enough to play for a @entity55 in 1992 to celebrate the @entity57 centenary and we played the @entity1 three times in a week			2
i played in the first test with players like @entity62 , @entity63 and some fellow @entity51 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 and we beat the @entity1 28 - 14			1
in fact , we battered them that day and , as it was the first time i had played them , i thought this would continue			0
@entity31 recorded a 41 - 31 win over @entity73 last weekend at @entity74 @entity41 said @entity31 will have to take their game up a couple of notches when they play @entity1 i played them a further six times in my career and it is fair to say they got their revenge as we lost all six games			1
the sixth turned out to be my last game for @entity31 in 2001 and it summed up what it is like to face the @entity1 and the same could happen today			1
we played very well for 70 minutes to be only 15 - 6 down but we had expended so much energy just to be in touch of them that we had nothing left in last 10 minutes and they ran in three tries			0
i was substituted with 10 minutes to go and i could barely put one foot in front of the other i was so tired			0
i was emptied and had absolutely nothing left to give			0
but it was nâ€™t enough , and this is why playing the @entity1 is such a challenge			2
the game today will be one of the fastest , hardest games the @entity51 players will have ever played			1
it will be a couple of notches up from last week against @entity73 and they will also have to face the @entity110 ! @entity41 said that it was brilliant facing the @entity110 before playing @entity1 and he loved the tradition @entity41 does not think it gives the @entity1 an unfair advantage and you can not let yourself get intimidated by it i get asked a lot what was it like to face the @entity110			1
my answer is , it was brilliant			0
i remember seeing it as a kid , trying to copy it and vowing , then , that i would love to face it one day			2
people that say it gives @entity1 an unfair advantage have never played international rugby			2
if you are intimidated buy a bunch of guys in black shirts singing and dancing in front of you , 60 seconds before you are about to play one of the best teams in the world , you should not be on the pitch in the first place			0
when the tv cameras close in to the faces of , especially , the @entity147 players with eyes popping and tongues hanging out , it can look intimidating but it should not intimidate the players			0
it inspired me and i hope it inspires the @entity31 team today to get the first win against the mighty @entity1 .			1

@entity31 face @entity1 at @entity74 on **saturday** evening
@entity31 have never beaten the @entity1 in 29 matches
@entity35 beat @entity1 once , playing for a world xv
he said it does not get any tougher than facing the @entity1
adding that **saturday** *'s* game will be one of the fastest and hardest games of the @entity51 players ' careers
