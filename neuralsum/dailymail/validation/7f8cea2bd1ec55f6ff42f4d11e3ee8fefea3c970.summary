a @entity1 man has captured astonishing video that shows an intelligent manatee drinking from a garden hose like a straw			0
the hose was hanging over the edge of a dock in @entity9 when the ' sea cow ' approached and ' grabbed ' onto it with its flippers			1
it then shoves the end of the hose into its mouth to get its refreshing fill of fresh water , which it requires to survive			1
even though manatees are found in salt water , they do not consume it			1
the large ' sea cow ' swims over to the long blue hose in order to get its much - needed fresh water intake filmed from the end of the dock , the manatee can be seen in the water below holding onto a long blue hose with its flippers			1
it takes a drink from it as the video maker , @entity37 , tells the people with him : ‘ i like how he uses his arm to put it into his mouth			0
’ the video shows the marine mammal dropping the hose and swimming after it			0
debating whether the manatee is a he or she , and deciding to go with the latter , mr @entity37 continues to give a play - by - play of the animal ’s actions			0
the video concludes with the obviously thirsty marine mammal still clutching onto the hose , guzzling water running from an unidentified source			2
the manatee can be seen using its flipper to grab the hose before it puts it into its mouth like a straw manatees are very large , fully aquatic and mostly herbivorous marine mammals			0
studies suggest that they must have some access to fresh water for proper regulation of the salt within their bodies			2
this means that on average they must return to fresh water every one to two weeks to get their fill			1
manatees ingest water through actively drinking as well as eating aquatic plants , and are able to move freely between marine environments .			0
