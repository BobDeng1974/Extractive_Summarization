by @entity0 for @entity1 the universe is bathed in a steady stream of ultraviolet light – but where this light comes from has long been a mystery			2
one theory is that light comes from quasars , which are distant objects powered by black holes a billion times as massive as our sun. but some astronomers believe that much dimmer galaxies , which are larger in number , are responsible for bathing the cosmos in light			1
a computer model shows one scenario for how light is spread through the early universe on vast scales of more than 50 million light years across now , new research by @entity32 - based scientists could finally solve the mystery of the uv light and understand how galaxies formed by analysing its distribution			1
' which produces more light ? a country 's biggest cities or its many tiny towns ? ' asked dr @entity43 , lead author of the study at @entity45 ( @entity45 )			1
' cities are brighter , but towns are far more numerous			0
understanding the balance would tell you something about the organisation of the country			0
' we 're posing a similar question about the universe : does ultraviolet light come from numerous but faint galaxies , or from a smaller number of very bright quasars ? ' one theory is that light comes from quasars , which are objects powered by black holes a billion times as massive as our sun ( artists 's impression pictured )			1
their intensity means quasars are relatively easy to spot answering this question will give scientists a valuable insight into the way that the universe built its galaxies – the places where stars and planets are born , live and die			1
it will also help researchers properly calibrate their measurements of dark energy , the mysterious force that is accelerating the universe 's expansion and will determine its far future			0
in july , astronomers discovered an enormous deficit of ultraviolet light in the universe			2
observations made by @entity94 have revealed that the universe is ' missing ' a large amount of light			0
experts say ' something is amiss in the universe ' with 80 per cent of the light missing			0
' it ’s as if you ’re in a big , brightly lit room , but you look around and see only a few 40 - watt lightbulbs , ' said the @entity107 ’s @entity106 , lead author of a new study on the missing light published in the @entity111			1
' where is all that light coming from ? it ’s missing from our census			0
' the research team - which includes @entity118 and @entity119 of @entity120 ’s @entity121 - analysed the tendrils of hydrogen that bridge the vast reaches of empty space between galaxies			0
when hydrogen atoms are struck by highly energetic ultraviolet light , they are transformed from electrically neutral atoms to charged ions			0
the astronomers were surprised when they found far more hydrogen ions than could be explained with the known ultraviolet light in the universe			0
the difference is a stunning 400 per cent			0
strangely , this mismatch only appears in the nearby , relatively well - studied cosmos			0
when telescopes focus on galaxies billions of light years away - which shows astronomers what was happening when the universe was young - everything seems to add up			1
the fact that the accounting of light needed to ionise hydrogen works in the early universe but falls apart locally has scientists puzzled			1
to help find the light source , astronomers use quasars as beacons			1
because of their intensity , quasars are relatively easy to spot in astronomers ' observations , even at distances more than 95 per cent of the way across the observable universe			2
' because they can be seen at such great distances , quasars are a useful probe for finding out the properties of the universe , ' professor @entity43 says			2
' distant quasars can be used as a backlight , and the properties of the gas between them and us are imprinted on the light			1
' as the light travels through the universe towards @entity178 , two things happen : first , the expansion of the universe causes the lights colours to become redder and wavelengths become longer			1
clouds of gas absorb some very specific colours of light , progressively eating chunks out of the full spectrum			2
analysing the light when it arrives at @entity178 allows scientists to reverse - engineer the process and so understand the intervening clouds			1
doing this for a million quasars should help researcher learn a great deal about the distribution of matter , including both the gas and the galaxies and quasars that bathe the gas in radiation			2
if galaxies caused the light , scientists would expect the remaining dark gas to be relatively evenly - spread across the universe			1
if quasars did it , they would find a much less uniform distribution			2
the team plan to use the @entity214 survey which will include detailed measurements of about a million distant quasars			0
although these measurements are designed to reveal how the expansion of the universe is accelerating due to dark energy , the new research shows that results from @entity214 will also determine whether the intervening gas is uniformly illuminated			0
in turn , the measurement of patchiness will reveal whether light in our universe is generated by ' a few cities ' - quasars or by ' many small towns ' – or galaxies			1
' it 's amazing how little is known about the objects that bathed the universe in ultraviolet radiation while galaxies assembled into their present form , ' says co-author @entity240			0
' this technique gives us a novel handle on the intergalactic environment during this critical time in the universe 's history			0
' some astronomers believe that much dimmer galaxies , which are larger in numbers , are responsible for bathing the cosmos in light			0
pictured is the @entity254 , nearly three million light years from @entity178			1

@entity45 is using quasars to understand origin of light
quasars are driven by black holes a billion times as massive as our sun
properties of the gas between them and @entity178 are imprinted on the light
analysing the light when it arrives at @entity178 allows scientists to reverse - engineer the process to find out its intensity , and how it was created
