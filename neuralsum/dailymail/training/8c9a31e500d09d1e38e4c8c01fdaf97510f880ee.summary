a former @entity1 researcher convicted last month of poisoning his neurologist wife with cyanide wants a judge to unfreeze his assets so he can pay his legal bills and establish a trust fund for their 7 - year - old daughter			1
attorneys for @entity11 , 66 , argued in a court filing tuesday that a previous court order freezing his assets is violating his rights to fund his defense , and merely preserving the money so his wife 's family , and its attorney , have assets to go after in a wrongful death suit			1
@entity22 , who represents dr. @entity24 's mother in that lawsuit , said he does n't necessarily oppose a trust fund , since any money won in the suit would go to @entity11 and @entity24 's daughter , @entity29			1
@entity1 scientist @entity11 ( left ) , 66 , who faces a life sentence in the fatal poisoning of his wife , @entity24 ( right ) , wants his assets unfrozen so he could start a trust fund for their daughter guilty as sin : dr @entity24 , pictured here during his trial , was convicted last month of first - degree murder @entity41 and @entity42 , @entity44 's parents , have been raising @entity29 in @entity45 from the time of her mother 's death , according to the @entity49			1
but he objects to @entity11 's request that the trust be administered by @entity11 's adult son from a previous marriage , @entity54 , a financial planner who lives with his newlywed wife in @entity56 , @entity57			1
family feud : the couple 's 7 - year - old daughter , pictured here with mrs @entity62 , is now in the care of her maternal grandparents , who do not want @entity11 's son to administer the trust fund ' he should n't be the one determining what terms of a trust may be acceptable to her , ' @entity22 said , referring to @entity11			1
' this seems to be an attempt by him to try to exert control from his jail cell			0
' but @entity11 's attorneys contend that , ' no authority , statutory or otherwise , permits the commonwealth to freeze defendant 's assets in order to ensure that @entity62 's personal injury attorney , @entity22 , can recover a fee of several hundred thousand dollars			2
' attorneys in wrongful death lawsuits typically receive anywhere from 25 to 40 per cent of any monetary verdict			0
@entity11 remains in the @entity90 without bond until he is sentenced on february 4			0
because he was convicted of first - degree murder in @entity24 's april 2013 death , he faces a mandatory life sentence without parole			1
@entity11 previously was given court permission to use some assets for his criminal defense , and it 's not clear how much he has spent			2
defense attorney @entity99 has suggested @entity11 has little remaining wealth to go after			0
but apart from the wrongful death litigation , the @entity90 district attorney 's office filed a motion asking a judge to require that @entity107 account for his assets			2
the @entity109 is doing that because prosecutors may seek restitution as part of @entity11 's sentence , and because records indicate @entity11 has transferred some assets to his two adult children from his first marriage			2
testimony at trial indicated @entity11 had assets worth at least $ 2.5million			0
@entity11 denied poisoning @entity24 and disputed whether that cyanide caused her death at all the jury found that @entity11 ordered cyanide using a university - issued charge card and laced an energy drink he gave @entity24 , 41			1
text messages from the night @entity24 fell ill show @entity11 suggested the drink would help @entity24 conceive another child , which her family and friends said @entity24 desperately sought			0
she died three days later			0
@entity11 denied poisoning @entity24 and disputed whether that caused her death at all			0
he testified he ordered the cyanide because it could be used in stem cell research related to his work involving @entity144 's disease .			0
