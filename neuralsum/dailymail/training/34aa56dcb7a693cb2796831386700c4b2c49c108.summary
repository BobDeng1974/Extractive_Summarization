the airspace @entity4 flight @entity2 was flying in when it was shot down was not restricted , but airlines had been warned about the potential dangers , it has emerged			1
the @entity7 said that an initial assessment revealed that the airspace the aircraft was travelling through was ' not subject to restrictions '			1
the @entity4 flight lost contact with aircraft control when it was flying over eastern @entity15			1
nine @entity16 and 27 @entity17 , according to @entity19 authorities , and fears of up to 23 @entity21 are among the 295 that have lost their lives			1
the @entity25 - based group said in a statement : ' based on the information currently available , it is believed that the airspace that the aircraft was traversing was not subject to restrictions			1
@entity15 authorities had barred aircraft from ground level to 32,000 feet but the downed aircraft was cruising at 33,000 feet , still within range of ground - to - air missiles , when it was hit			2
there was speculation that the doomed @entity2 had taken a short - cut across the disputed region of eastern @entity15 to save fuel			1
as relatives gathered at airports for news of missing loved ones , it emerged that airlines had twice been warned about the risk of flying over an area where two @entity15 military aircraft hadalready been shot down this week			1
in april , the @entity60 advised carriers to consider alternative routes after outlining ‘ the possible existence of serious risks to the safety of international civilflights ’			0
on monday , @entity67 – the body that coordinates all traffic across @entity71 airspace – sent out an official note to airmen , known as a @entity74 , repeating the warning and saying it ‘ stronglyadvises ’ avoiding the airspace			2
@entity4 flight @entity2 taking off from @entity79 in @entity79 before it was shot down but many carriers continued to use the route because it was shorter and therefore cheaper			0
@entity2 had taken off from @entity79 at lunchtime and was flying at around 33,000ft on one of the main routes from @entity71			2
the jet was travelling at 33,000 feet at 490 knots when it disappeared from radar screens while approaching the @entity89 border			0
it is believed that the @entity4 pilots ignored several warnings to avoid the airspace over @entity15			1
it is understood the @entity96 jet used the @entity15 route to save fuel as diverting north or south would have taken longer			1
earlier on thursday , air accident investigators were planning to inspect the proposed flight plan lodged by pilots on board @entity4 flight @entity2 to see if they flew over a warzone as a cost - cutting measure			1
an unverified image posted online show @entity15 inspecting what appears to be wreckage from the doomed flight the 17 - year - old jet was shot down over eastern @entity15 despite @entity16 , @entity71 and @entity21 commercial aircraft being warned against using the airspace since april			1
one aviation expert revealed : ' @entity4 , like a number of other carriers , have been continuing to use it because it is a shorter route , which means less fuel and therefore less money			2
' in april , the @entity121 and @entity120 warned : ‘ taking into consideration the recent publication by the @entity89 of a series of notices to airmen ( @entity126 ) modifying the @entity127 which is under the responsibility of @entity15 , and their intent to provide air traffic services ( @entity131 ) within this airspace , the @entity120 draws the aviation communities ’ attention to the possible existence of serious risks to the safety of international civil flights			1
‘ due to the unsafe situation where more than one ats provider may be controlling flights within the same airspace from 3 april 2014 , 0600 @entity140 onwards , consideration should be given to measures to avoid the airspace and circumnavigate the @entity127 with alternative routings			2
‘ on july 8 , the @entity148 of @entity15 closed its airspace to civilian aircraft after rebels shot a military transport aircraft that was flying over 20,000 feet			1
safety regulators will investigate why the pilots of the jet , pictured , decided to fly through a warzone the restriction warned commercial aircraft against using @entity160 airspace			1
a notice to @entity167 , seen by @entity168 warned : ‘ due to the potential for conflicting air traffic control ( @entity171 ) instructions from @entity15 and @entity89 authorities and for the related potential for misidentification of civil aircraft , @entity16 aircraft operators are strongly advised to avoid , until further notice , the airspace over @entity33 , the @entity162 and the @entity163			1
’ the @entity177 supplied airlines with a list of alternative routes avoiding the conflict zone			0
the @entity21 @entity182 had also banned its aircraft from the @entity33 region			1
the suspected shooting down of a large passenger plane while flying at altitude presents airlines and their passengers with an extremely serious new development in air travel , according to aviation experts			1
the @entity193 issued airlines with a number of alternative routes avoiding @entity15 @entity71 and @entity21 air safety bodies warned against using @entity15 airspace since april because of the risk @entity200 , the former head of group security at airports group @entity202 , and professor of aviation security at @entity205 , said there had been suggestions airlines had been warned to avoid the route because of the violence below			1
but many carriers continued to use it because it was shorter and therefore cheaper			0
he said : ' it is a busy aviation route and there have been suggestions that a notice was given to aviators telling airlines to avoid that particular area			2
' but @entity4 , like a number of other carriers , have been continuing to use it because it is a shorter route , which means less fuel and therefore less money			0
' i expect the area will be declared a no fly zone and aircraft will have no choice but to take a different , longer route			0
' airline carriers are avoiding the area where the passenger aircraft crashed , as well as the east of @entity15 in the wake of the tragedy			1
@entity89 @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 , @entity243 @entity242 , @entity245 airlines , @entity247 's @entity246 and @entity21 's @entity248 have diverted all their planes away from the strife - hit region			2
' after the incident we have decided to avoid @entity15 airspace , ' a @entity253 spokesman said			1
@entity257 and @entity258 have also decided to temporarily re-route flights to bypass @entity15 , according to @entity260 @entity248 tweeted : ' out of an abundance of caution , @entity248 is not routing flights through @entity15 airspace			2
' prof @entity200 said it was ' extremely unusual ' for political disputes to spill over and endanger the lives of civilians travelling in commercial flights in the skies above			0
and he suggested those behind the shooting ' deliberately ' targeted a passenger plane as it would have been obvious from its appearance that it was a commercial aircraft and posed no military threat			0
he said : ' this is probably the first time this has happened in recent history			0
the aircraft was flying at such a height that it is unlikely to have been a military aircraft			0
' you would be able to tell it was a civilian aircraft not a military aircraft with the naked eye because of the jet plumes behind it			2
' this would almost certainly have to be a deliberate act , for whatever reason - we can only speculate			0
' it should have been quite visible to people on the ground that it was a civilian aircraft , by the size of it and the shape of it			0
anyone who has looked at a civilian aircraft or large military aircraft will know the difference			0
' he said the plane 's black box could contain vital clues to help piece together what the pilots knew during their final moments in the cockpit			2
but he warned that tracing the flight recorders could be very tricky as they are probably ' now in a war zone ' somewhere in the @entity15			1
he added : ' the pilots and passengers could well have been totally unaware that this missile was heading for them			0
' aviation experts fear that @entity2 used the route through @entity15 as it was shorter and saved fuel if today 's incident is confirmed as a deliberate act then @entity15 airspace could well be closed down , meaning diversions for @entity16 carriers who currently fly to and over the area			1
‘ this could be a very serious development , ’ said @entity326 , air transport editor of @entity328 magazine			0
he went on : ‘ if reports are true , we are not talking about small - arm fire but serious weaponry			0
normally even if planes fly over a war zone they can go high enough for the conflict not to be a worry			0
‘ any decision about the opening or closing of @entity160 airspace will be a matter for the @entity15			2
it could well be that part or all of that airspace will now be closed			0
‘ also , individual airlines , including @entity16 carriers , could decide to detour around @entity15			1
’ mr @entity326 continued : ‘ it 's really quite incredible that it should be @entity4 involved in this , after what happened earlier in the year			0
‘ this is not a small airline on a faraway route			0
this was a major airline flying from a @entity71 destination to a capital in the @entity357			2
there must be serious concerns about how the airline can recover from this			0
‘ there will obviously be political as well as aviation concerns from all this			0
this will run and run			0
’ air crash investigators will look for the aircraft 's black boxes to determine what exactly happened to the jet			1

@entity121 and @entity120 warned pilots to avoid @entity15 in april
@entity16 , @entity71 and @entity21 aircraft banned from *overflying* the warzone
airspace ' was not subject to restrictions ' according to airline *industry* group
@entity381 was just 300 metres above *minimum*
crash investigators will probe the aircraft 's flight plan following the disaster
aviation experts fear the jet entered the warzone to save burning fuel
