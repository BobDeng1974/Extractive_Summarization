by @entity0 spacewalks are one of the most impressive and dangerous feats an astronaut can perform on the @entity5 fixing critical components often involves lengthy stints outside the spacecraft , with a spacesuit acting as the only barrier between an astronaut and lethal radiation			0
but this could soon be a thing of the past			0
the space station 's @entity17 robotic arm , dubbed @entity19 , is currently attempting to fix itself without any help from a human			1
together , @entity24 and @entity19 make up the space station 's robotic @entity19 , making this the first ever robot self - repair service in space @entity19 ’s multi-limbed robotic helper , called @entity24 , is in the process of a week - long repair job to move and fix old cameras			1
@entity24 has arms that are more than 9.8 feet ( 3 metres ) in length which can attach to power tools that act like its fingers			1
together , @entity24 and @entity19 make up the space station 's robotic @entity19 , making this the first ever robot self - repair service in space			1
the robots are controlled remotely from the @entity48 headquarters in @entity49 , @entity50 , and @entity52 ’s @entity51 in @entity53 , @entity54			0
@entity24 is moving a camera on @entity19 to the mobile base to replace a completely broken camera			1
it will then install a new , spare camera on the @entity19			1
the cameras are part of an 11 - strong set on the @entity19 that perform surveys outside the space station			2
@entity24 's role is to keep the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) in working order			2
having @entity24 on call will reduce the amount of risky spacewalks , giving astronauts more time for science , @entity24 ’s special skills and unique location outside the @entity5 offers an opportunity for space agencies to test ground for new robotics concepts like servicing satellites in space			2
the robot can ride on the end of @entity19 to move from worksite to worksite , or hitch a ride on the @entity85			0
the space handyman is currently in the process of a week - long repair job to move and fix old cameras on @entity19			1
the astronauts ' only involvement in the operation was to push the spare camera into an airlock so @entity24 could grab it			1
while this is the first time a robotic repair task like this has been performed , @entity95 , mission control supervisor at the @entity48 , told @entity100 it wo n’t be the last			2
‘ using the @entity19 and @entity24 reduces the overall number of spacewalks , definitely , ’ he said			1
‘ spacewalks are very complex and use a lot of space station resources			0
‘ they monopolise astronauts not only for the duration of the spacewalk , but in the weeks leading up to it for all their preparation			0
’ however , @entity24 has some of its own drawbacks that it still needs to overcome			0
for instance , it can currently only deal with ‘ robotically compatible ’ bolts and screws			0
@entity118 is now working to make the system more flexible			1
it added that @entity24 is due to replace a circuit breaker in june and to repair equipment outside the space station to prepare for some astronaut spacewalks later in the summer			2
having @entity24 on call will reduce the amount of risky spacewalks , giving astronauts more time for science			0
pictured is former commander , @entity131 , on a spacewalk around the @entity5			0

@entity24 is in the process of a repair job to fix old cameras on @entity19
its arms are 9.8 ft ( *3m* ) in length and it can attach power tools as fingers
astronauts ' only involvement was to push spare camera into an airlock
the @entity48 is working to make the system more flexible
