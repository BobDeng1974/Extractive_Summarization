@entity1 head coach @entity0 has warned his first - team hopefuls to be ready as he considers making changes for monday night 's trip to @entity5			1
the @entity6 has presided over an 8 - 0 horror show at @entity8 and last weekend 's error - strewn 2 - 0 home reverse at the hands of @entity11 , with keeper @entity12 and central defender @entity13 among the guilty men as the @entity1 contributed to their own downfall			1
@entity12 was one of the heroes of last season 's @entity18 run and remarkable @entity21 survival fight , but with understudy @entity22 breathing down his neck , he could find himself sitting on the bench at @entity25			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 admits he is ready to make changes against @entity5 on monday @entity22 ( left ) could replace @entity12 ( right ) in goal at @entity25 @entity22 , a summer arrival from @entity29 , is yet to make a @entity21 appearance for the club with his only involvement to date coming in the @entity18 , but @entity0 wants the giant @entity33 - and any other player with hopes of forcing their way into his plans - to be prepared			1
he said : ' that 's something we will know if he plays and how he performs			0
i tell my son to be ready - imagine my players			2
' be ready , then if i give you the chance and you are not ready , you can not blame me			0
i can not send you a text , an e-mail , @entity48 , whatever you want , to make sure that you 're ready			0
' it 's part of the job			0
a few players are pushing for their places and i need to make sure that i pick the right team			0
' @entity54 ( left ) warms up during the @entity1 ' training session at the @entity56 on friday midfielder @entity57 grins during training as @entity1 prepare to face @entity60 's side @entity12 endured an intensely difficult day at the @entity61 with three of the goals he conceded being scored by his own team - mates , and it was he who served up the ball to @entity67 midfielder @entity66 to score at the death last saturday after @entity13 had done much the same before the break			1
but @entity0 , who insisted before the @entity11 game that he would not drop the @entity71 because of one sub-standard performance - but might if his dip in form continued , will not make a snap decision			2
he said : ' i will look at the decision and i am going to make a strong decision either way			0
keeping @entity12 or not playing him is a strong decision because he 's a very important player			0
you will know on monday night			1
' @entity0 seems certain to make changes , although given that injuries continue to deprive him of the services of defenders @entity87 and @entity89 and midfielders @entity90 and @entity92 , his options are decidedly limited			0
@entity0 , pictured speaking to his team in training , wants his entire squad to be ready to play on monday night however , he has had one piece of good news this week with striker @entity98 , who announced his return to the side with a double in the 3 - 1 victory over @entity103 on october 4 , having shaken off the foot problem which curtailed his involvement against @entity11			1
@entity0 said : ' fletch is back and he has been training this week similar to before @entity103 , so i am really looking forward to seeing @entity106 on the pitch on monday			2

@entity1 have won just one game all season and sit 18th in the table
