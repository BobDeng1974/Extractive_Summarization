before and after : @entity0 , pictured ( @entity28 ) age 54 in 2009 , was fed up of being mistaken for her partner 's mother so underwent a £ 5,500 facelift ( r ) aged 57 she feels much younger @entity0 said : ‘ there is nothing more embarrassing or hurtful than being mistaken for your partner ’s mother			1
i ’m not a vain person but it left me utterly distraught and destroyed my confidence			2
' it was so humiliating and hurtful that i even considered ending my relationship because i could n’t face the thought of it keep happening			2
but @entity44 is wonderful so i instead i decided to get rid of the lines and jowls and it was the best thing i ever did			0
' since having the surgery some people have assumed i ’m younger than him which is quite funny and certainly a compliment			1
' but i do n’t want to risk ever being mistaken for his mother again so i ’m planning more surgery just to be sure			1
' @entity0 says she first noticed her skin aging prematurely in her thirties			1
she said : ' my cheeks were sagging and i already had lots of lines but i did n’t worry about them			0
i ’ve always been an outdoors person and never cared too much for my appearance			0
’ she met @entity44 soon after through friends			0
‘ the eight year age gap did n’t bother me at all			0
he was great fun and that ’s all i thought about			0
we did n’t notice an age gap and neither i thought did other people			2
’ it was only as the years passed that @entity0 noticed that the age gap begin to show			1
@entity0 was fed up of being mistaken for @entity44 's mother - he is eight years her junior - and people often commented on the mismatch one such incident occurred during a romantic hotel break with @entity44 , when she was aged just 42			1
‘ we ’d had a lovely evening and started chatting to another couple at the bar			0
when i mentioned feeling peckish they asked @entity44 if he and his mum wanted to join them			0
‘ it took a few seconds to realise they were talking about me			0
i ’d was gobsmacked and quickly made my excuses and fled back to our room in tears			0
‘ it ruined our weekend away but i hoped it was just a one off and tried to forget about it			0
’ only a year on the couple were enjoying a night out in a bar struggling to get served when another drinker stood aside and kindly offered @entity44 the space for his mother , pointing to humiliated @entity0			1
she says : ‘ i could n’t believe it had happened again			0
we both just smiled and went along with it to save any further embarrassment but of course inside i was devastated			0
’ @entity44 did his best to assure @entity0 he found her as desirable and attractive as he had always done but her confidence was crumbling			1
since her surgery , people think she is younger than him which she loves			1
she is even planning for operation number two to ensure that it stays that way ‘ my job means i attend lots of meetings and i started to take more time with my hair and make up			2
but it never made any difference			0
’ more humiliation followed when @entity0 joined @entity44 for a work night out , only for a colleague to ask who had brought their mother along			1
@entity0 said : ' this time @entity44 jumped to my defence and demanded an apology but it was too late , the damage was done and i left in tears			1
' ' we ’d always had such a wonderful relationship but i even considered ending it because i could n’t face the humiliation of people mistaking me for his mum			2
‘ i felt young inside but clearly the outside did n’t match			0
i decided to look into cosmetic surgery			2
’ a few weeks later in 2009 she booked a full facelift with upper and lower eye surgery in @entity136 costing £ 5,500			1
@entity0 spent a staggering £ 5,500 on her facelift and also had @entity6 and fillers to enhance her look she said : ' when i left for the airport @entity44 admitted he was worried he would n’t recognise me when i came back			1
' i told him i hoped he did n’t or it would have been a waste of money			0
’ days after arriving with a friend for moral support she underwent the four hour operation			0
‘ i looked like i had been run over by a bus when i came round but it did n’t really hurt and just hours after coming round i was sitting on my balcony having a gin and tonic , it was wonderful , ’ she added			0
as soon as the swelling started to reside @entity0 says she noticed a huge difference			2
a week later in april 2010 she flew home after having her hair restyled and coloured and having @entity6 and fillers to smooth out the remaining lines			1
as soon as the swelling started to go down , @entity0 noticed the difference and immediately felt much more confident ‘ @entity44 told me i looked fantastic and for the first time ever i believed him			2
‘ i know he ’s always loved me but my improved confidence has definitely improved our relationship , ' she said			0
last year @entity0 saw a @entity165 surgeon for more botox and fillers and is now planning a second facelift			1
though she has not been mistaken for @entity44 ’s mother since her surgery @entity0 is determined to prevent it ever happening again by having another facelift			1
‘ i think of myself like a car , i need regular maintenance so am planning another procedure soon			2
