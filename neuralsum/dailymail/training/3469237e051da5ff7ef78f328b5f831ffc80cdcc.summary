and he was allowed to work at @entity20 charity shops in @entity24 and @entity25 on a community work programme before he went on the run			2
a spokesman for the shop said they decided to end @entity6 ' placement in august after liaising with the prison			1
a whistleblower claimed that @entity6 had a row with a woman who worked in the @entity24 shop			1
he further claimed that a recommendation was made to remove @entity6 from open conditions five days before he absconded			1
he said that there are also concerns that @entity6 disappeared last sunday night , but that guards only discovered he had gone at monday lunchtime because had been staying in an annexe that had not been checked			1
the revelations come as @entity43 step up patrols to find @entity6 , warning the public not to approach him , but to dial 999 or 101			1
posters have been put up in shop windows across @entity24 , where he is thought to have been spotted			0

@entity6 had a row with a woman charity shop worker while on day release before he absconded from jail @entity6 , originally from @entity71 , murdered @entity15 , from @entity72 , @entity73 , after kidnapping him as he made his way home from a college woodwork class on january 31 , 1995			1
months earlier , @entity6 had split up acrimoniously with @entity15 's older sister , leaving her with their young child			1
he murdered @entity15 in revenge and was jailed in 1997 while @entity15 's body still had n't been found			0
after serving 12 months , @entity6 rang detectives from his cell to reveal that he had buried @entity15 's body in a house in @entity85			1
it was three - and - a - half years since he had murdered him			2
the @entity88 said it was investigating the escape and could not comment on the claims			0
@entity6 was being held in open conditions at @entity16 along with other killers , sex offenders and offenders locked up for arson with intent , the whistleblower alleged			1
he claimed that housing such dangerous offenders at the lock - up where @entity101 and @entity102 prisoners are kept was putting staff and inmates at risk			2
he also said there were barely enough prison officers to cover night time patrols because of budget cuts			0
prison : @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 - which can hold 1,261 prisoners - was given a scathing report by the @entity113 of prisons in april , which said it was unacceptably dirty he added : ‘ there is no way that a schedule one offender like @entity6 would have been placed into open conditions in the past			1
‘ but @entity6 is just the tip of the iceberg			2
it used to be very strict , but that is not the case now			0
there are sex offenders , killers and arsonists walking around in open conditions and nothing can stop them walking down the road and catching a bus			1
‘ the result is that people like @entity6 are free to walk straight out of the front doors			2
we have a situation at night where the staffing has been cut from five down to three when it is at its most vulnerable			0
’ the whistleblower said the merger of what was @entity142 with @entity143 to form the new @entity144 also led to a massively diluted criteria for prisoners being accepted into open areas			2
he added : ‘ we are now seeing the direct results of these changes and increased staff cuts on the ability of staff to properly monitor prisoners			0
‘ this is not about trying to scare people - it 's about letting the public know what is really going on behind those walls			0
‘ there are prisoners in there who have serious convictions for some really heinous crimes			0
‘ i am amazed that they have been put in open conditions - it 's unbelievable			1
there are other establishments in the country who are far more capable of coping with these kinds of offenders			0
‘ when staff raise concerns the big stick that is used is that the prison could be privatised , but we probably already have lower levels of staff than in the private sector			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity184 said an investigation into the absconding of @entity6 was ongoing and that all prisoners in open conditions were ' rigorously risk assessed ' and approved to transfer by the @entity188			1
@entity16 - which is governed by @entity189 and can hold 1,261 prisoners - was given a scathing report by the @entity113 of prisons in april , which said it was unacceptably dirty			1
the report , based on an inspection in november 2012 , added that there were high levels of assaults , many inmates found it easy to get hold of drugs and some staff seemed to lack motivation			0
it also said : ‘ some communal areas were filthy even after they had been “ cleaned ” by wing cleaners , and waste was thrown out of cells into the exercise yards below , which went unchallenged			0
’ the prison said ' decisive action ' had been taken , and the @entity212 said the management team had been strengthened			0
he added : ‘ this is now a matter for the police and we are supporting them in their investigation			0
‘ the number of absconds from open prisons in 2012/13 was the second lowest since records began , and all those located in open prisons have been rigorously risk assessed and deemed suitable for open conditions			1
‘ we are not complacent about this issue and are looking at ways in which the risk of absconding can be reduced further			2
‘ for the vast majority of prisoners serving indeterminate sentences , which includes those on life sentences , transfer to open conditions follows a recommendation by the independent @entity188			1
anyone who does abscond will be returned to a closed prison and may face further criminal charges			0
’ @entity238 , head of volunteering at @entity20 , said : ‘ for the past six years , @entity20 has successfully been running a prisoner volunteer programme			0
‘ this is with risk - assessed prisoners , who are eligible to work out in the community			2
this partnership with the prison service has helped raise vital funds from our shops , whilst also supporting the prisoners ' resettlement			0
’ she said @entity6 worked in its @entity24 shop in june this year and in july was transferred to the @entity25 shop			1
‘ in august , a decision was taken in consultation with the prison to end mr @entity6 volunteering with @entity20 , ’ she said			2
‘ all prisoners that volunteer at @entity20 have been through a robust and rigorous risk assessment process to ensure the safety of @entity20 staff , our volunteers and shoppers			0
’ detective inspector @entity263 said : ‘ if anyone spots @entity6 we would ask that they call us immediately so that we can respond to the call straight away - any delay in contacting us , even if it 's just to take a little time to get home , may mean we lose the opportunity to capture @entity6 if it is actually him who has been spotted			1
please do not approach him , call us on 999 or 101 as soon as possible			0
’ @entity275 mp @entity274 said she was meeting the prison 's governor to discuss @entity6 ' disappearance			2
she said she expected to be given a full account of what happened in ‘ this very serious case ’ .			0
