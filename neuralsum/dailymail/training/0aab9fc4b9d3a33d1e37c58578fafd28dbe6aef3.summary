@entity0 admits he would swap his century of @entity3 caps to win a @entity4 or @entity5 with his country			1
the @entity3 forward , who wins his 100th cap this weekend against @entity9 at @entity10 , has never been beyond a quarter - final with the national team			2
he said : ‘ i could sit here saying i ’ve got 200 caps and 100 goals for my country , but the ultimate is to win a trophy and that ’s what we all want to do			1
@entity0 is set to make his 100th appearance for @entity3 against @entity9 on saturday but the @entity3 captain says he wants to emulate @entity23 and win an international trophy @entity25 - 125 @entity26 - 115 @entity27 - 114 @entity23 - 108 @entity28 - 107 sir @entity29 - 106 @entity30 - 106 @entity31 - 105 ‘ that ’s why we play football , to win			1
that ’s the target and hopefully sometime soon we can achieve that			0
‘ obviously i ’m not going to be as big a legend as sir @entity29 – he ’s won the @entity4 with @entity3 , so to eclipse that i ’d have to win the @entity4 , which would be a massive achievement			1
‘ the thing that i ’ve taken away from @entity41 is the hurt at getting knocked out – it was hard to take			0
‘ but we have to move on , we know what a good squad we have - it ’s a relatively young group			0
we all believe in each other , we believe in the ability we ’ve got and we have to go and prove that as a team			0
@entity0 is six goals short of sir @entity29 's ( below ) record of 49 goals for his country ‘ to get 100 caps for @entity3 , there ’s not many players who have done it – would be a great achievement			1
i ’ll be proud to join that club and is something that myself and my family would be honoured by			0
’ @entity0 , who captains @entity3 following @entity63 ’s international retirement , admits he still gets nervous about representing his country			2
the @entity3 forward , talking in this weekend ’s matchday programme , added : ‘ the highlight for me is that feeling you get after you ’ve sung the national anthem – you run off and hear the crowd , particularly in the big games and the tournaments - you hear the support and you know what it means to the fans and the country			0
’ @entity0 says he is still relatively young and believes he can beat the scoring record @entity28 was congratulated by @entity3 manager @entity79 after his 100th cap @entity0 was pictured with 99 schoolkids all wearing @entity3 shirts at his old primary school @entity85 aiming to continue qualifying run			2
