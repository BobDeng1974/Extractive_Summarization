these schoolchildren in southern @entity1 are so keen to get to school that they make the perilous journey on narrow wooden ladders every day , with no safety precautions			1
their village in the remote @entity8 mountains in @entity9 is surrounded by sheer drops on every side , making the school run a daily struggle			2
the only way out of @entity16 village , unless the children have time for a four - hour cross country detour , is via a series of rickety - looking ladders leading down to the valley below			1
so when youngsters like five - year - old @entity43 start school at the nearest town , the first thing they have to learn is how to climb			1
' in centuries past these mountains were a fortress for the villagers			0
the land is good and the farms thrive but it is hard to get in and out , ' said one local			0
@entity43 admitted : ' it 's quite high but i try not to look down			2
' steady as they go : staff hold the narrow ladders steady for the next person to gingerly come down after them team work : a schoolgirl tries to help by holding it steady while she prepares to go next at home : 5 - year - old @entity64 , who climbs the ladders to school every day , reading before she sets off on her long morning journey ' my parents showed me how to do it safely and now i do n't think too much about how high it is , ' she added			1
villagers have asked local officials to supply a road down to the valley so that these children do not have to risk their lilves			0
however , the road over the difficult terrain would cost nearly Â£ 10 million so residents are not getting their hopes up that it will happen any time soon			0
' there are fewer than 100 people living there			0
it would be cheaper to buy them all helicopters , ' said one			0
preparations : @entity93 's morning routine is just like any other schoolgirl 's until she leaves home to make the dangerous journey down the mountain isolated : the village in the steep mountains where the children set off from every day to go to the valley below daunting prospect : @entity103 , who uses the ladders every day , at home with his family			1

mountain - top village of only 100 residents is cut off from the outside world , apart from ladders leading to valley below
*brave* schoolchildren use the wooden ladders with no safety precautions to get to school every day
five - year - old @entity43 *explained* : ' it 's quite high but i try not to look down '
