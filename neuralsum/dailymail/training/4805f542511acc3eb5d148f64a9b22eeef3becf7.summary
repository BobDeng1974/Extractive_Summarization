the average @entity1 commuter spends about 1.5 hours a day at the wheel			0
while not great for stress levels in general , there are other ways that the daily churn through traffic can negatively affect health			1
research by my team at the @entity12 has shown how drivers and pedestrians are being exposed to very high levels of air pollutants at traffic lights			1
the @entity18 links air pollution to seven million premature deaths every year			1
drivers and pederstrians are being exposed to high levels of air pollutants at traffic lights , experts say			1
pollution levels are 29 times higher at traffic lights than in free - flowing traffic , research found it 's well known that road vehicles in particular emit polluting nanoparticles which contribute to respiratory and heart diseases			1
despite efforts to encourage a reduction , car usage has remained fairly constant in recent decades			0
our team monitored drivers ' exposure to air pollutants at various points of a journey and found traffic intersections were high pollution hot - spots due to the frequent changes in driving conditions			1
with drivers decelerating and stopping at lights , then revving up to move quickly when lights go green , peak particle concentration was found to be 29 times higher than that during free - flowing traffic conditions			1
also of course , while travelling by road we are generally pretty close to the air pollution source , which is the tailpipe of preceding road vehicle			1
though drivers spend just 2 per cent of their journey time passing through intersections managed by traffic lights , this short duration contributes to about 25 per cent of total exposure to these harmful particles			1
it 's not always possible to change your route to avoid these intersections , but drivers should be aware of the increased risks at busy lights and at least try to avoid regularly taking routes that force them to sit in traffic inhaling potentially harmful fumes			1
where this is unavoidable the best way to limit exposure is to keep vehicle windows shut , fans off and try to increase the distance between the cars in front where possible			1
pedestrians regularly crossing such routes should consider whether there might be other paths less dependent on traffic light crossings			2
but there is more to it than asking drivers to take circuitous routes			0
local transport agencies could also help by synchronising traffic signals to reduce waiting time and consider alternative traffic management systems such as flyovers			0
cars emit polluting nanoparticles which contribute to respiratory and heart diseases			0
when stopped at a traffic light , people are close to the air pollution source , which is the tailpipe of preceding road vehicle they could also consider the appropriate placement of traffic lights			1
the use of these systems in built up residential areas , near schools or hospitals may serve to manage traffic flow but at the cost of trapping higher concentrations of harmful pollutants in exactly the areas where residents , and vulnerable members of society will most regularly commute or walk			1
i have written before about the use of low - cost sensing to capture air pollution hotspots in urban areas			2
the kind of data such projects could deliver feed directly into research such as this			0
the more we understand about where pollution hot spots are , the more direct action we can take in our own lives and the more we can push for greener , cleaner planning			0
the @entity1 's @entity139 recently described air pollution as a ' public health crisis '			2
these considerations are not just a ' nice to have ' , they have a direct effect on our health and wellbeing			0
this article was originally published by @entity147			0
air pollution raises the risk of suicide among middle aged men , according to new research air pollution raises the risk of suicide among middle aged men , suggests new research			0
a @entity157 study of more than 1,500 people who took their lives in @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity157 , found males aged between 36 and 64 were most prone after breathing in smog caused by factories and cars			2
after exposure to increased levels of nitrogen dioxide in the two to three days before their deaths , they were in 25 per cent more danger than normal			0
exposure to air pollution particles raised the risk of suicide by six per cent			1
and those exposed to pollution were more likely to use violent means to end their lives			2
professor @entity178 , of the @entity179 , said : ' this suggests vulnerability to suicide following air pollution exposure is not uniform across @entity160 residents and some are more vulnerable than others			2
' the findings published in the @entity188 are particularly alarming as middle aged men already have the highest risk for suicide			0
while they do not show pollution causes people to kill themselves , they suggest it may interact with other factors , such as depression or pollen allergies , to make people more suicidal			1
earlier results from the same study found the risk was highest during the spring and autumn , when most mental health agencies hire more crisis line staff			0
men aged between 36 and 64 were most prone after breathing in smog caused by factories and cars smog levels are determined by the concentration of pollutants - ozone , sulphur dioxide ( @entity214 ) , nitrogen dioxide ( @entity216 ) - in the air			2
every day we breathe in tiny particles of these , which can embed themselves in our lungs			0
studies have shown breathing polluted air can slightly increase your risk of lung cancer and affect the growth of children 's lungs			0
some doctors think that it may increase the risk of developing asthma , but this remains unproven .			0

professor @entity235 is a senior *lecturer* at the @entity12
warns pollution is 29 times higher at traffic lights where cars rev *engines*
people are also closer to the tailpipe of the vehicle in front of them
therefore they are being exposed to health - damaging pollution particles
pollution linked to 7 million premature deaths a year , official figures show
