@entity1 striker @entity0 believes the champions now have to target victory in every remaining game to retain their title			1
city remain five points behind @entity10 leaders @entity13 after slipping to a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity12 on sunday			1
the @entity15 side also have a game in hand and @entity1 have just 11 matches left to turn the situation around			1
@entity0 says @entity1 can still retain the @entity10 if they win all their remaining games @entity0 has only made appearances from the bench so far for @entity1 , and was booked in the defeat by @entity12 @entity0 said : ' it is disappointing , we have made it difficult for ourselves now			1
' if @entity13 win ( their game in hand ) it will be more difficult for us to get close to them			1
but we still hope - there are 11 more games and every game we just have to win , be positive for the rest of the league and try to get maximum points			1
' we need to win , win , win and hope @entity13 will drop some points			2
it is a difficult moment for us but we still hope we can do it			0
' @entity0 might hope to play a greater role in @entity1 's run - in after making just three goalless substitute appearances since signing from @entity44 in january			2
city were beaten 2 - 1 at @entity46 after stunning strikes from @entity48 and @entity49 ( above ) @entity0 will hope to make more of an impact on the title run - in than he has been able to so far since signing in between @entity48 and @entity49 's strikes @entity53 equalised , but @entity1 were well beaten @entity0 did not feature for a month after the move was completed due to his involvement in @entity59 's @entity58 win and has had to make do with coming off the bench since			1
his 78th - minute introduction at @entity46 came with his side already 2 - 1 down and he was unable to affect the outcome			0
his only notable contribution to the game came when he was booked for an aerial challenge on @entity68 that arguably could have been worth a red card			0
@entity1 had cancelled out @entity48 's superb early strike with a well - worked @entity53 equaliser but the outstanding @entity49 restored the hosts ' lead with a 75th - minute stunner			2
@entity75 had hit the post and he spurned two other good chances , while @entity78 also went close late on , but @entity12 dominated and ultimately deserved their victory			2
@entity80 insists he will keep focusing on his own team 's games rather than watching @entity13 @entity80 defended his selection after he stuck with the same line - up that thrashed @entity85 last week manager @entity80 will continue to chase @entity13 but the challenge from below is strengthening , with third - placed @entity87 just four points behind			1
@entity80 said : ' we are worried about our team , not the other teams that are behind us			0
it is important to try and continue playing the normal way			0
' in the last two games in the @entity10 we scored nine goals and we won the two games			0
that is why we repeated the same starting 11			0
' this is more important than to be worried about things you can not manage			0

defeat to @entity12 leaves @entity1 five points behind @entity13
league leaders have a game in hand , but @entity1 still believe
@entity0 says they can win the title if they win all 11 remaining *fixtures*
@entity80 : @entity1 will fight until the end
