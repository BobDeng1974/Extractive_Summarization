school days are often said to be the happiest of your life			1
but for @entity3 , being packed off to board at the age of seven is not an experience he wishes to repeat for his own children			1
@entity7 of @entity9 ’s son yesterday claimed his prep school was ‘ a hotbed of the sorts of things that are coming out now ’ , and reportedly revealed that one master would join naked boys in the shower			1
@entity3 ' former headmaster has dismissed as ' complete rubbish ' the food writer 's claims his old primary school was a hotbed of impropriety in a candid interview , he said of @entity24 in @entity25 : ‘ it was just certain things that were n’t right and i ’d say to my dad and he ’d say , “ well , you tell me if anything happens ” , and it never did			1
so perhaps i ’m speaking totally out of turn			2
’ it is understood the unnamed master was not himself naked in the shower			1
but the anecdote is bound to raise questions about what is acceptable for a teacher acting ‘ in loco parentis ’			2
the food writer and @entity42 restaurant critic , 39 , was a pupil at the school – motto ‘ mens sana in corpore sano ’ or ‘ a healthy mind in a healthy body ’ – in the early 1980s before going to @entity48			1
last night @entity49 , 76 , who was headmaster of @entity24 when mr @entity3 was there , before retiring from the post in 1997 , dismissed any suggestion of impropriety , and said no official complaints were received			1

he was a very happy little boy			2
’ the school , where boarding fees are currently £ 25,953 a year , is one of the main feeder schools for @entity48			1

i was n’t going to read that sort of stuff about my mother , just as much as she would n’t want to read it about me , or my kids certainly would n’t want to read it about me			0
i do n’t think i ’ve ever listened to it			0
’ tom on : his parents ' doomed marriage asked if he felt his parents got on while he was growing up , mr @entity3 said : ‘ perfectly well			1
i mean , i think as a boy when you ’re away a lot you see less , but always			0
’ he added : ‘ they divorced when i was 18			0
i think you had a sort of inkling perhaps but i always felt that it was just a normal way of things happening			0
‘ @entity150 knows my mother has been called every name under the sun. i suppose we have as well			0
we ’ve never really cared			0
‘ my mum ’s got an @entity155 now and i was like , “ do n’t read the below - the - line stuff , ” and , of course she ’s [ saying ] , “ you ’re not going to believe what they just said here ! check this out			2

’ mr @entity3 said the incident stopped him using the @entity184 drug			1

he said : ‘ my mother could n’t care			0
when i had bad reports , she ’d be by the window making faces behind my father going , “ you ’re going to comprehensive if this happens again ” , and he meant it			0
“ i ’m not going to spend all this money on you if you ’re not going to pull your f * * * ing finger out			0
” ‘ he drove me past @entity214 comprehensive [ in @entity215 ] and i remember thinking how many pretty girls there were but also tough - looking boys – not like the sort of boys at @entity48			1
