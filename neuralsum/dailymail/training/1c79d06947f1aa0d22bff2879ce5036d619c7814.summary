@entity0 is about as a complete striker as you could wish to see			1
i remember watching him tear apart @entity4 in the @entity5 two years ago , when he scored a hat - trick in @entity8 ’s 4 - 1 triumph days after a treble against @entity10 in @entity11 , so when i saw him in the flesh it was easy to see why he causes defenders such problems			0
@entity0 is ' about as complete a striker as you could wish to see ' , according to @entity18 @entity0 celebrates after scoring for @entity8 against @entity4 in 2012 @entity5 intelligent movement his movement off the ball is phenomenal , which means it ’s just so hard to contain him			1
he reminds me of @entity24 , the @entity25 striker who , like @entity0 , played for @entity26 and it would not surprise me if @entity0 had modelled his game on @entity28 or been coached by the same people			1
the reason is that he has those little darting runs that can get in behind defenders and which @entity28 was so good at			2
they are a nightmare to defend against because of the speed and intelligence of the runs			2
@entity0 , though , probably has even more to his game that @entity28 , in that he can start such runs from further out			1
in addition , he ’s very strong and his muscular build will suit the @entity43			0
the @entity45 poses for his unveiling with new boss @entity47 and fellow team - mate @entity48 @entity0 poses with club legend and assistant manager @entity49 shortly after his arrival at @entity52 ability to adapt importantly , he can adapt			1
if you want to play into feet , he ’s perfectly comfortable with that and if you want to hit balls over he top , he can run on to them			0
he can hold the ball up with his back to goal , he ’s good in the air and his strike rate is excellent			0
his finishing is n’t all about power , he has subtlety as well			0
you can see why i think he ’s the complete package			0
it will be intriguing to see how @entity47 fits him into the @entity71 side , though i suspect he will play up front with @entity73 , as @entity74 could easily play in the position just behind them , the slot @entity78 has been filling			1
@entity0 in action for @entity80 last season before his switch to @entity71 on deadline day @entity0 shares many similarities with former @entity85 , @entity4 and @entity25 star @entity28 fitness questions the only question mark will be fitness , given that he has just recovered from cruciate knee ligament surgery			1
with the surgical advances for that type of injury , you would hope he has n’t lost any speed or sharpness and can get back to his best			0
i hope i have n’t scared our @entity99 defenders who will face him on sunday			1
you ca n’t make a plan for someone like @entity0			2
our defenders need to be playing at nine or 10 to contain him			0
there ’s no reason why they ca n’t do that and , from @entity99 ’s perspective , let ’s hope it will take him a game or two to adapt			2
eventually , though , i ’m confident we will see one of the best strikers in the world .			0
