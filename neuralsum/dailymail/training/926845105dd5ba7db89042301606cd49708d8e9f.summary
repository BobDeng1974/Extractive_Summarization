by @entity0 published : 18:18 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 18:27 est , 26 september 2013 the number of private sector workers saving into a company pension has collapsed to 2.7million , the lowest level since records began in 1953 , official figures revealed yesterday			1
the statistics expose the rapid destruction of pension saving in @entity10 , with a drop of 200,000 in the last year alone			1
the @entity13 figures mean that , with a private sector workforce of 24.2million , only 11.2 per cent of private sector workers are actively saving into a company pension scheme			1
doing the maths : the statistics expose the rapid destruction of pension saving in @entity10 ( file picture ) in 1967 – the year that pension saving among private sector workers peaked – the figure was 8.1million , equal to 81 per cent of a private sector workforce of ten million , according to the @entity13			1
the decline is forcing a generation to work - till - they - drop			0
a record - breaking number are working beyond state pension age			2
yesterday the pensions minister said the shocking figures highlight the importance of ‘ crucial ’ reforms , which force bosses to pay into a pension for their workers			2
in the public sector , the situation is very different			1
of the 5.7million state workers , who have been nicknamed ‘ the pensions aristocracy ’ , 5.1million , or 89.5 per cent , are members of an occupational pension scheme			1
recent changes , making them pay more into their pensions and to retire later , have triggered strikes , including this week ’s four - hour walkout by firemen			0
unhappy : recent changes , making them pay more into their pensions and to retire later , have triggered strikes , including this week 's four - hour walkout by firemen ( pictured at @entity49 ) but they still enjoy the most generous type of pension , known as a ‘ defined benefit ’ scheme			2
' the scale of the challenge is clear			0
too few people are saving for their retirement , which is why our pension reforms are so crucial ' pensions minister @entity60 these schemes promise to pay workers a percentage of their final salary , or an average of their salary over their career , when they retire			1
but this generous and guaranteed type of pension is almost extinct in the private sector			1
there , workers are being put into ‘ defined contribution ’ schemes , which make no guarantees about the size of a pension at retirement , with bosses typically paying far less into the scheme			1
since 2000 , the number of private sector workers with a gold - plated ‘ defined benefit ’ pension has crashed from 4.6million to only 1.7million , and is expected to keep falling			1
huge challenge : pensions minister @entity60 said the figures highlight the importance of ' crucial ' reforms this means that of the 6.8million workers who are paying into a ‘ defined benefit ’ pension , three - quarters work in the public sector			1
more than half of homeowners aged 50 or over plan to use their property to pay for their retirement , a study says			0
they are known as the ‘ home is pension ’ generation , or ‘ hippies ’			2
last year , only 28 per cent of homeowners in this age group who are still working said they planned to rely on their homes as their pension , but this has almost doubled to 52 per cent this year , according to the study from insurance firm @entity112 =			2
on average , their home is worth £ 258,000			0
their options include downsizing to a smaller property or taking out an equity release loan , which ‘ releases ’ cash from their home			0
it is only paid back when they die			0
the study , of 1,014 homeowners , is further evidence of the pensions crisis			0
the government is trying to end the pensions crisis by making all bosses pay into a pension for their workers , and requiring them to sign up their workers to a scheme			1
new rules mean that over the next five years all workers aged between 22 and state pension age who earn more than £ 9,440 are being ‘ automatically enrolled ’ into a scheme			1
yesterday ’s @entity13 figures do not include the impact of automatic enrolment because the figures relate to april			0
the automatic enrolment rules did not begin until october			0
around 1.6million have been automatically enrolled since october , according to the @entity144			0
fewer than 10 per cent are believed to have ‘ opted out ’			0
pensions minister @entity60 said : ‘ the scale of the challenge is clear			0
too few people are saving for their retirement , which is why our pension reforms are so crucial			2
’ the collapse of pensions in the private sector was kick - started by @entity155 ’s raid in his first budget as chancellor in 1997			1
he abolished the tax credit that pension funds could claim from the @entity160 on dividends			2
it is estimated to have cost them £ 6billion a year ever since .			0
