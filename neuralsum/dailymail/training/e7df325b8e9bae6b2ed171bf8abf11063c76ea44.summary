@entity0 speaks matter - of - factly about the moment , barely 10 seconds into the @entity1 , when a sickening clash of heads with fellow @entity5 @entity4 shattered his right eye socket and cheekbone			1
‘ i put my hand to my face and knew straight away something had been broken , ’ the cross-code star told @entity9 this week			1
‘ i could feel my jaw was out of shape and i felt the pain straight away			2
there was a sharp stinging down my face			2
it was like when you break your arm			2
it did n’t really cross my mind to stop playing			2
it ’s not every day you get to play in a @entity1			1
i just got on with it			2
’ @entity0 the new signing for @entity25 looks on during a @entity25 training session on friday not only did @entity0 ‘ just get on with it ’ , he produced a man - of - the - match display in his final game of rugby league before switching codes after the @entity31 won their first @entity1 in 43 years			1
the performance prompted an outpouring of praise from an @entity36 public usually loath to hand out accolades to @entity5 sporting heroes			1
‘ people talk about @entity0 becoming the greatest @entity5 forward to ever come to @entity36 , ’ said @entity40 chief executive @entity39			1
‘ the reality is he could be one of the greatest forwards to have ever played the game			2
’ the 25 - year - old ’s courage , indeed some would say foolhardiness , in playing on earned @entity0 a place in rugby league folklore while showing why @entity25 and @entity5 had been so keen to lure him back to @entity5 before next year ’s @entity49 here			1
the prospect of the 6ft 5in 18st wrecking machine , who combines outstanding physical prowess with quick feet , deft hands and a commitment to tackling which sometimes borders on the reckless , wearing the red rose of @entity5 excites head coach @entity58			2
speak to those who know @entity0 , among them @entity31 owner @entity61 , and they talk of a fiercely driven individual who places family above all else			1
@entity0 celebrates with @entity31 team - mate @entity65 during the 2014 @entity1 after he had shattered his eye socket and cheekbone in a man - of - the - match performance the death of his father @entity71 from motor neurone disease affected his outlook on life and informs the decisions he takes today			1
‘ losing my dad taught me a lot about life , ’ said @entity0 who , as a teenager , used to carry his stricken father to bed in the final years before his premature death at the age of just 47			1
‘ motor neurone disease is a pretty devastating disease			1
it was obviously a shock to the family			0
i look back on those days now and i ’m able to take plenty of joy from the time we spent together in his last days			0
it definitely shaped me as a young man			1
i was 16 or 17 and it taught me a lot about things			0
' it puts a lot of things in perspective and it ’s why i do n’t take anything for granted			0
i ’m very grateful for everything i ’ve got			0
not just being able to play sport for a job but to be healthy and be able to give something back to a few people is quite rewarding			0
‘ i ’d like to think i ’ve already overcome quite a few big hurdles in life			1
when you face something like losing a parent you learn to realise what is real and what is not			0
you learn what should actually affect you and what you can just brush off			0
‘ as a professional sportsman we ’re in an incredibly fortunate position so we should never complain , although i still do sometimes , but you learn a lot going through things like that			0
but i really do believe it has helped shaped me into what i do today			0
’ unveiled as a @entity25 player on thursday after landing in @entity5 on wednesday , the former @entity123 , who convinced a sceptical @entity36 public he was the real deal , must now attempt to grasp the technical aspects of union — the ruck and maul among them — which have been gradually removed from league over more than a century of professionalism			1
he must do so away from his mum @entity132 and brothers @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 , who have stayed in @entity137			0
his girlfriend @entity138 will join him in @entity25 in the next few weeks			0
@entity25 head coach @entity139 , a forerunner in the wave of former league players and coaches who have flooded the union market since professionalism in 1996 , will not attempt to mould @entity0 into a ‘ traditional ’ union player and remains relaxed about his best position			1
@entity0 alongside @entity25 team - mate @entity148 ( centre ) and head coach @entity139 ( right ) whether he ends up in the back row or midfield when fully recovered from the complicated surgery which left him with five metal plates in his face following the @entity156 , @entity0 can be sure of a warm welcome when he makes his union bow			1
but he ’s used to that			0
‘ @entity0 ’ has shown he is no shrinking violet			1
‘ what makes a good sportsman is that competitive edge , ’ he said			0
‘ it separates the good from the great			0
i ’m not saying i ’m great but i ’ve been around teams for 10 seasons now and you see a lot of different characters and personalities			0
you can see why people succeed through their character traits			2
‘ i ’ve been targeted in league for years so i ’ll be ready for what comes at me in union			2
i ’m well used to it , believe me			0
’ @entity0 had dinner with his new team - mates @entity148 and @entity181 on his first night in his new city			1
it was perhaps no surprise he should seek out two players with rugby league backgrounds in an @entity187 club which arguably has been influenced more by the rival code than any other			2
@entity0 had dinner with new team - mate @entity181 ( left ) on his first night in his new city he trained with his new team - mates on friday but is unlikely to make his first - team debut until mid- to late december ; nine months before the @entity49			1
it seems a huge challenge but @entity0 will take it in his stride			1
‘ i think the biggest challenge i ’ve faced in my career was leaving @entity5 and moving to @entity36 [ in 2010 ] to play in the @entity1 , the toughest competition in rugby league , ’ he said			1
‘ i thought that was a bigger challenge than coming back over here			2
‘ i know people over here			0
i did n’t know anyone over there			0
this is big in its own right			0
playing rugby union is going to be fun and i ’m going to have a great time in a new city			1
‘ i ’m just going to enjoy it			0
i wo n’t let the pressure mount up on me			0
we ’ll see how i get on in time			0
