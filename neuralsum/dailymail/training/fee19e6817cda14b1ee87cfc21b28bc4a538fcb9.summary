one of her duties is said to include making tea for the warders			2
her fondness for her life in jail makes a mockery of a ruling by the @entity64 , rejected this week by the @entity65 , that whole - life tariffs are unlawful			1

in the letter , which she wrote in 2004 but waited four years to post , she told @entity19 : ‘ i do not feel any hostility towards you , just a sadness , a deep sadness , that all this has happened , and that your heart could not feel a truth that i wish you could know			0
