by @entity0 published : 10:07 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 12:40 est , 22 july 2013 the @entity1 is part - funding a $ 600,000 study to find out whether it can control the weather using geoengineering			1
it is backing the @entity7 ' ( @entity6 ) study to investigate whether geoengineering - such as solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal - could be used to curb the effects of climate change			1
according to @entity6 , the study will look at ' a limited number of proposed geoengineering techniques ' and is funded by the @entity1 , @entity15 , as well a @entity16 , @entity12 reported			1
the @entity1 is part - funding a $ 600,000 study to find out whether they can control the weather using geoengineering - perhaps stopping dramatic weather such as this lightening storm in @entity23 the purpose of the study is to look ' generally on the potential impacts of deploying these technologies , including possible environmental , economic and national security concerns , ' according to the @entity6 website			1
the @entity1 told @entity30 news website @entity31 : ' it 's natural that on a subject like climate change the @entity33 would work with scientists to better understand the phenomenon and its implications on national security			1
' geoengineering is a controversial idea that involves the deliberate and large - scale intervention in the @entity44 's climatic system with the aim of combating global warming - in this case to change the weather			2
one of the techniques , solar radiation management is purely theoretical at the moment			1
the idea is to reflect sunlight in a bid to block infrared radiation , which some scientists think could stop temperatures rising			0
there has been much speculation over the years as to whether the @entity30 government is interested in geoengineering and has set its sights on manipulating the weather , according to @entity12			2
weather manipulation is a particularly contentious in the @entity30 after commentators have claimed that huge tornadoes that devastated cities such as @entity67 ( pictured ) , were actually deliberately made by the @entity30 government using the @entity68 in @entity69 there are claims that it has controlled the weather before , including rumours that they tried to cloud - seed during the @entity75 , by spraying substances into the air to produce artificial clouds that resulted in rain or snow			2
it has been reported that the @entity83 government has seeded clouds in territories that were suffering severe droughts , to force it to rain			0
it was claimed that they also seeded clouds ahead of the 2008 @entity89 opening ceremony in @entity90 to divert rain to other places			0
they also reportedly fired iodine crystals into rain clouds over the city to ensure that inclement weather did not ruin the big event			0
weather manipulation is presently particularly contentious in the @entity30 after commentators accused the government of deliberately creating huge tornadoes that devastated cities such as @entity67			0
they claim that the huge weather events were conjured up using the @entity104 antenna park in @entity69			0
@entity83 has previously made artificial rain ( pictured ) in northern provinces to fight a severe drought as well as reportedly at the @entity108 to ensure a sunny ceremony			0

the @entity6 study will *explore* whether geoengineering , including solar radiation management , could be used to halt climate change
@entity30 *institutions* including the @entity1 , @entity15 and @entity16 are funding the study
it is claimed that the @entity30 and @entity83 governments have previously manipulated the weather
