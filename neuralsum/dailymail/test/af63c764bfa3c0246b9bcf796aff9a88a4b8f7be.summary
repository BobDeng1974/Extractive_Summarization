it was not something that i intended to do , or something i do regularly			0
‘ i ’m just absolutely speechless			0
’ @entity0 told the judge his attempts to find a new club might be hindered if he was forced to carry out community work			1
he said the travelling to different clubs would be the biggest problem			0
explaining his situation , he said : ‘ i have got my current agent looking around on my behalf and there have been a few clubs that might be interested			0
‘ and because we are closer to the end of the season they are just waiting to see whether they are going down or staying up			0
’ ‘ once i do work for a club i would have to come back to the court and say that something has come up			0
’ judge @entity54 told @entity0 , who temporarily resides in a hotel in @entity12 using the £ 125 living allowance he receives from the club , that he would be more than capable of carrying out unpaid work before the new season begins			1

@entity12 defender @entity0 has played just three championship games for the @entity20 this season @entity0 has been told by @entity12 boss @entity19 that he is surplus to requirements at @entity64 he played for @entity66 ’s academy between 2001 - 06 , and @entity67 ’s between 2006 - 07			1

’ the judge ordering him to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work as part of a 12 - month community order and to pay £ 85 in costs			2
‘ as i have said , because the goods were of a high value , the fact you do have a similar conviction - albeit a long time ago - and the fact that you did try to run away from the shop before being apprehended by the police , this makes it serious enough to merit a community order			2
‘ in the present circumstances i do think it ’s appropriate for such an order to be made			0
