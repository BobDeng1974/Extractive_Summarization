@entity1 columnist @entity0 has questioned whether @entity2 did enough to keep @entity3 at @entity4			1
@entity3 has always been honest to a fault and even on @entity2 ’s own club media he could not help but come clean about the reasons behind his seismic departure from @entity4			1
in an emotional interview , the 34 - year - old admitted his fear at the prospect of becoming just a bit - part performer at the club where he is held up alongside @entity16 as the club ’s greatest ever player was too devastating to contemplate			1
hence the contract offer he was offered by the club in late october has remained unsigned and he will head to the @entity22 in the summer for a new life			1
@entity3 recalls a key conversation with @entity25 which swayed his mind to leave @entity2 @entity3 spoke to @entity27 in an exclusive interview released on saturday afternoon ‘ i think the key conversation or moment was with the manager when he sat me down not so long ago and said it was time to manage my games for me and for the team , ’ said @entity3 , as he explained the decision that has caused shockwaves on @entity37 and beyond			1
‘ i ’m bright enough to realise it is the right thing for everyone , but when you ’ve been a starter and a mainstay in the team for such a long time , it was a very difficult conversation to have			1
‘ i accept it and i ’ll continue to give everything i ’ve got , whether i ’m starting , coming off the bench or whatever , but that was the key conversation that swung me to deciding to come away for a short while			1
‘ the reality is i am going to be 35 in the summer			2
i ’ve been here for a long time , i ’ve been coming to this training ground since i was eight			0
i always knew it was going to end one day and that it was going to be an emotional decision			0
’ @entity3 was deeply hurt by being left out of @entity2 ’s @entity57 tie against @entity58 earlier this season even though he knew manager @entity25 was only managing in the way he felt fit			1
he has subsequently been left out of some @entity60 matches			0
the midfielder retired from international football after last summer ’s @entity63 to prolong his club career but even without international football @entity25 felt his legs and physical recovery were insufficient for him to play in every @entity2 game			1
and that would only have increased next season			0
the relationship between iconic captain and young manager has been under the spotlight all season			2
a piece by @entity3 ’s friend @entity0 suggesting @entity2 had not done enough to keep their leader only added fuel to the fire			1
in his own way , @entity3 tried to assure his fans that he can see @entity25 has acted with a professional hat , and that he did n’t feel his treatment has been anything personal			1
@entity3 ( centre ) warms up during @entity2 's training session at @entity88 on saturday morning @entity3 prepares for an @entity90 clash against @entity91 after announcing his decision to leave @entity2 @entity2 's captain stretches with @entity94 ( left ) and @entity96 ( centre ) at @entity88 @entity3 has confirmed he will leave @entity2 for a club in @entity98 , with @entity100 favourites to sign him ‘ i had an idea it was going to come at some time — i ’m a human , not a robot			1
i ’m not 24 , ’ he said			0
‘ i wish i was 24 , i wish i ’d met @entity25 when i was 24 because i think i ’d be sitting here talking about a lot of titles that we ’d won together			1
the reality is , @entity25 came into this club when i was 32 and it ’s a shame that relationship did n’t start 10 years ago			1
‘ i had an idea the conversation was going to come at some time , but it was a painful conversation to have and that was the key moment			2
’ @entity25 confirmed there had been no offer of a coaching position to @entity3 in negotiations because he got the impression from the player that he wanted to continue being regarded purely as a player			1
‘ it was n’t part of the conversations because @entity3 has n’t got his badges , and he is n’t the type who will just go into coaching blind			2
‘ he is very thoughtful			0
his focus was very much in the present — which means playing because he still believes he can play beyond this season			0
‘ @entity3 knows that once he has finished playing there will be plenty of time for him to go into coaching if that ’s what he wants to do			2
’ @entity2 has been like a city in mourning since @entity3 ’s announcement			1
@entity100 looks his likeliest destination but for now the player admits his biggest challenge is keeping his own emotions in check so he can help @entity2 in the remaining months of the season			1
they are still in the @entity149 , which may be their best route of qualifying for next season ’s @entity57 , and begin their @entity90 campaign at @entity153 on sunday night			0
‘ it ’s been an emotional 24 hours for myself and my family , but there are still six months to go and i ’ve still got plenty to try and achieve , so i am trying to keep my focus on that			0
there ’ll be plenty of time for tears and sentiment come the end of the season , ’ he insisted			0
@entity2 boss @entity25 insists he wanted to keep @entity165 at the club next season @entity3 gives a thumbs up as he leaves @entity2 's @entity88 training centre on friday afternoon going to @entity170 with wife @entity171 and their three daughters does n’t sound like a punishment but breaking the news that they would soon be leaving the only home they ’ve known was not easy			1
‘ it was tough to tell the girls , even though they ’re not big football fans , ’ he said			2
‘ that ’s when the emotion started in the house , that ’s when it became tough			0
at the same time , it ’s a great opportunity for my family and myself			0
but yes , it ’s tough			0
’ @entity25 has a way with words that does n’t always encourage sympathy			2
but the @entity193 has been in an unenviable position over @entity195 is the player ’s legend — @entity199 boy who singlehandedly won the @entity57 and turned down @entity200 the same summer — @entity25 knows every time he left @entity3 out , it would create questions			1
and yet if he wants to deliver a new high - tempo @entity2 based around the likes of @entity206 and @entity207 , a break from @entity3 might suit him too			1
‘ i have not been party to whatever has gone on with the club and his agents , but we wanted to keep him at the club			2
i still wanted @entity3 to be a part of what i was doing at the club , ’ he said on saturday			1
‘ but it went on and on and nothing was agreed and the closer you get to january when a player is in the last year of his contract , he is not going to rush into things because he can speak to other clubs			0
any player would do that			0
’ the popular outcome would be for @entity3 to enjoy the sunshine of @entity230 for a couple of years , return to @entity4 as a coach under @entity25 and one day become the manager of @entity2 himself			1
yet both men know fairytales do n’t always come true			0
@entity2 skipper @entity3 slots home the first of his two penalties against @entity240 on @entity241 @entity3 , pictured in action against @entity240 , will join a @entity244 team in @entity98 ‘ i do n’t see any reason why @entity3 could n’t be a top manager , ’ said @entity25			1
‘ in my time here , he ’s been a wonderful leader			0
if he puts that commitment into wanting to do it , like he ’s shown in his football career , there ’s no question why that could n’t happen			2
‘ but time will tell on that			0
you ca n’t just click your fingers and do it			0
it ’s a pressure situation			0
and if it ’s something you ’re not accustomed to or used to it can be hard			0
’ neither is gerrard naive			0
‘ i will only come back and serve the club if i feel i can help			0
i ’ll always be a fan , of course , no matter what happens in the future			0
but i would n’t like to come back just to be @entity3 the player and just be around			2
’ for now , @entity3 has professed to have been overcome by the tributes and messages from team - mates , supporters and people in his city			1
‘ i did n’t realise it would be as big as this , ’ he says			0
he has personally promised @entity25 there will be ‘ no downing of tools ’ between now and may			2
this year ’s @entity90 final will be on @entity3 ’s 35th birthday — what a way that would be to go out			2
the professional paths of @entity25 and @entity3 are going to diverge in six months ’ time			1
but if it ’s to be called divorce , at least it is an amicable one .			0
