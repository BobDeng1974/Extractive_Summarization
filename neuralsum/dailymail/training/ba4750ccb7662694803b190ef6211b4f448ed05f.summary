it is a year to the day that @entity1 fell to the floor , screaming and clutching his left knee in what seemed a fairly innocuous challenge on @entity6			1
it is at the same stage of the @entity9 that @entity10 face @entity11 on sunday afternoon — the third round — that he cruelly ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in that match against @entity16			1
it would painfully cost him a place in @entity10 ’s side which won the tournament that year , after beating @entity16 2 - 0 to progress , and @entity24 ’s @entity23 squad			1
it has been a year and @entity1 has managed just three substitute appearances , constituting a total of 51 minutes of football			1
thirty of those came against @entity38 on @entity39			1
‘ it has gone very quickly , ’ @entity1 said			1
‘ there have been loads of things in my life that have changed completely			0
things happen for a reason			0
‘ i have had the opportunity to work on different parts of my game which i missed out on when i was younger			0
' the actual development stage of it			0
i am really looking forward to it if i am given the opportunity			2
‘ it is the chance to go out there and get a few more minutes			0
i am not going to be expecting too much from myself early on			0
' it is nice to blow cobwebs away to be honest and be out there playing with your mates again			0
i have missed that obviously			0
’ the 25 - year - old also missed attending the @entity9 final at @entity66 — when @entity10 came from two goals behind to beat @entity11 and win their first trophy in nine years — due to ‘ a personal thing			1
’ @entity1 missed out on seeing his side lift the @entity9 last may due to personal reasons the @entity24 forward cheekily gestures to the @entity16 fans telling them what the score is after going off but he did catch it on television and struggled not being a part of the club ’s history with his team - mates			1
‘ i was n’t at the final , ’ he explained , ‘ i had a personal thing in my life that happened and i could n’t attend			1
i was able to watch it on television and it was tough to take			0
' but it was a special moment for everyone			0
it had been so long and hopefully that was the push start to everything and to build on from that			0
' it has been a stop - and - start season at times and with the @entity9 — being the holders — you want to keep hold of that			1
‘ it is important to get a good start , especially against @entity11			1
we will have home support and we have to bounce back from a disappointing result at @entity38			2
’ @entity1 was playing some of the best football of his career for club and country before the injury			2
so confident was the player that he goaded @entity16 fans who had pelted him with coins as he was carried off on a stretcher , by using his fingers to indicate that his side were two - nil ahead			1
@entity1 managed just 51 minutes of action in the whole of 2014 after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament the 25 - year - old came on with 30 minutes remaining in @entity10 's 2 - 0 defeat at @entity38 on thursday the winger looked in little pain at the time , but that was the last football he played for 10 months			1
when he returned in november with two substitute appearances against @entity125 and @entity126 , he looked set to make his first start soon			0
but manager @entity25 released him for international duty for the @entity130 qualifier against @entity131 and friendly with @entity132 and he came back with a groin problem after putting in some extra shooting and crossing practice during training			0
@entity10 have looked light in attack in recent weeks and badly need @entity1 back			1
they have lost @entity138 to @entity139 on loan and @entity141 picked up a three - match ban for head - butting @entity143 when they played @entity145 on @entity146			2
the @entity147 completes the last game of his suspension against @entity11			2
@entity1 looks in good spirits in training on saturday ahead of the @entity31 ' third round game against @entity11 @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity27 are all struggling with injuries , slashing @entity25 ’s options going forward			1
that presents an even greater challenge to progress in their cup tie with @entity11 , but @entity1 is intent on improving @entity10 ’s rich history in the competition after they went level with @entity168 — with 11 wins — when they were victorious last season			1
‘ we want to continue that , ’ @entity1 said			2
‘ history is important and we want to become those legends as well			0
we need to knuckle down and start performing ‘ you see a lot of clubs put out weakened teams			0
but for me , it is a game you want to win			0
the fans always love a good cup run and going to different stadiums			2
‘ i enjoy going to a @entity184 side , for instance			2
it is things like that which they do n’t usually get the opportunity to do very often			0
there is something special about the @entity9			2

@entity1 hopes to enjoy more @entity9 *success* after missing out on the @entity31 ' @entity66 *triumph* and the @entity23
the 25 - year - old ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament against @entity16 in the third round of the competition last january
the @entity10 forward was then *unavailable* to attend the cup final in may due to personal reasons
@entity1 came on as a second - half sub in @entity10 's 2 - 0 defeat at @entity38 on @entity39
the @entity31 take on @entity11 on sunday afternoon in the third round this year
