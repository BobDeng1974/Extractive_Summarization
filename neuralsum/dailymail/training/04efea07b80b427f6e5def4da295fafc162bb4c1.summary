by @entity1 reporter published : 20:41 est , 7 september 2013 updated : 07:15 est , 8 september 2013 the 911 operator who answered the now - famous may 6th call from one of the women held for a decade by @entity8 kidnapper @entity7 was reprimanded on friday for hanging up on her before police arrived			1
public criticism was leveled against the operator 's seemingly unsympathetic tone with the very excited @entity7 , once the audio of the call was made public by authorities			1
@entity17 made the call to police after she and her 6 - year - old daughter , fathered by @entity7 , were rescued with the help of neighbors four months ago			1
police then found @entity7 , who was abducted in 2002 and @entity7 , abducted in 2004 , in the home			1
his body has since been claimed by his family who are planning a private service and burial for the man who was one month into a prison term of life plus 1,000 years			2
according to a disciplinary letter sent to four - year veteran dispatcher @entity45 , the @entity8 of @entity8 found he ' improperly handled a 911 call from a kidnap victim and failed to remain on the line with the victim until responding officers arrived on the scene			1
' the dispatcher had pleaded ' no contest ' at a hearing last month			0
on friday , he was informed that a letter of discipline would be placed in the his personnel file for three years			1
dead : @entity7 's body is set to be claimed by his family today after he hanged himself in his prison cell on tuesday @entity62 commander @entity61 said in the letter to @entity45 that he could have demonstrated " more empathy and could have been more compassionate in your dealing with ms. @entity7			1
" in a recording of the 911 call , @entity17 is heard telling the operator , ' i 've been kidnapped and i 've been missing for 10 years , and i 'm , i 'm here , i 'm free now , ' and seemingly pleading with the operator ' i 'm @entity7			1
i 've been on the news for the last 10 years , ' with the dispatcher responding , ' i got , i got that , dear			2
' ' without question , you should have kept her on the line as i believe that that simple , required act would have enhanced her sense of safety , ' @entity61 said			2
it came after @entity83 revealed on tuesday that @entity7 's victims have mixed feelings about the suicide of the man they spent ten years of their life with due to the warped bond they shared with him			1
freed : @entity7 , left , @entity7 , center , and @entity7 , right , have all spoken out about recovering from their horrific ordeal being kidnapped , raped and tortured by @entity7			1
they have declined to comment on his suicide relatives of @entity7 and @entity7 said the girls are happy they can finally put the traumatic episode beside them but also experienced some confusion when they heard the news			1
@entity104 , an aunt of @entity7 , told @entity83 that both girls were going through a ‘ mixture of emotions ’			1
she said : ‘ there ’s so many mixed feelings about it			0
@entity111 is a little confused			0
we are trying to protect her because we have to remember , she was a 14 - year - old girl ( when she was kidnapped )			0
' but @entity111 and @entity7 wo n’t have to think about him because he ’s not around any more			1
’ she also revealed that @entity111 ’s mother @entity116 has been able to move beyond her anger and is already pitying @entity7			1
' @entity116 probably feels bad for him			0
we have a very strong , spiritual family and so does @entity7			1
she does n’t care about him , she ’s just happy her daughter is home			0
she does n’t feel any anger			0
' @entity7 - whose daughter is fathered by @entity7 - has also not commented on his death			1
though @entity7 serially abused the women physically , emotionally , and sexually on a daily basis , they were also so badly manipulated they developed ' @entity128 ' - slowly ' bonding ' with their captor in gratitude for rare small favors he would grant them			1
his suicide will have come as a slap in the face to his victims and their families , robbing them of the justice that had brought some form of closure to their ten - year nightmare			0
lonely death : this is an isolation cell at @entity147 in @entity148 , @entity149 , like the one where @entity7 hanged himself tuesday @entity7 was being housed alone in an isolation unit for his protection , where he would be checked every 30 minutes			1
prison officials said he hanged himself with a sheet during a break between inspections			0
initially , @entity7 was being checked on every ten minutes , but this stopped in june after he was deemed not to be a risk to himself and taken off suicide watch			1
an autopsy confirmed his death was suicide by hanging			0
@entity7 's attorneys tried unsuccessfully to have an independent psychological examination of the 53 - year - old done at the @entity168 before he was turned over to state authorities following his conviction			2
a full investigation is underway as to how he was able to take his own life while under the watchful eye of prison guards - who said he was always calm and cooperative with them			0
while his defense attorneys said they are suspicious as to why their client would have committed suicide just one month into his prison term , @entity168 prosecutor @entity176 issued a scathing statement			0
' these degenerate molesters are cowards			0
they con and capture vulnerable children , ' he said			0
' this man could n't take , for even a month , a small portion of what he had dished out for more than a decade			0
' let this be a message to other child kidnappers : there will be a heavy price to pay when you are caught			0
you wo n't enjoy the captive side of the bars			0
' house of horrors : this is the four - bedroom home where @entity7 kept his victims for a decade - unbeknown to his family or his neighbors restraints : a rusty chain can be seen over a dirty mattress on the floor of the room @entity7 and @entity7 shared basement : the pole the girls were all chained to and raped many times throughout their time in captivity is pictured as well as his four elder children , @entity7 fathered a young girl to victim @entity7			2
it is unclear if the child knows her father is dead			0
@entity7 was jailed after keeping @entity7 , @entity7 and @entity7 captive in unimaginable conditions in his house for ten years			1
when prison guards found @entity7 hanging in his 8x12 foot cell on tuesday , they immediately began trying to resuscitate him			2
he was taken to @entity224 , where he was pronounced dead about an hour and a half later - shortly before 11pm			0
it costs nearly $ 25,000 a year on average to house a prison inmate in @entity149			0
the cost to house @entity7 , who was kept in high security , would likely have been much higher			2
@entity7 's family - he has a son and three daughters by his ex-wife - were informed of his suicide about 1am			2
a spokeswoman for the the @entity237 said the agency will make a full investigation of @entity7 's suicide to determine whether regulations were followed and if anything could have been done to prevent his death			2
the end : @entity7 acknowledged in court last month that he would die in prison			2
