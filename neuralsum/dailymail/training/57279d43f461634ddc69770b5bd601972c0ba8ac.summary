@entity3 's copycat crimes were only exposed when the latest victim told his father he had been abused by the now 63 - year - old			1
the horrified father then revealed his own secret which he had kept bottled - up for three decades			1
today the jury found @entity22 guilty of 17 of the 18 charges involving the two men and one other			0
@entity5 crown court heard that @entity22 had been a supervisor at a leisure centre swimming pool in the 1970s when he took advantage of the then schoolboy			2
he had offered the 11 - year - old free swimming sessions before manipulating him into participating in sexual acts in return , it was claimed			1
in a bizarre twist , the police discovered the historic sexual abuse case on the victim , now 45 , when his son came forward alleging sexual assaults by the same man in the late 1990s			1
police interviewed the father and were shocked to find he had also suffered at the hands of @entity22 30 years previously , said prosecutor @entity44			1
she told the court the son , now 27 , took 11 years to pluck up the courage to tell his parents and police of his shocking ordeal			1
she said @entity22 offered him cigarettes and alcohol and let him watch porn at his flat in exchange for sexual favours			2
this , said ms @entity44 , was a mirror image of what his father - who had suppressed the abuse for four decades - had been put through at the hands of @entity22			2
he let the father swim at the @entity65 , in @entity66 , @entity67 , free of charge in return for sexual encounters in the shower room , bar area and changing rooms , it was claimed			2
the jury heard that @entity22 had been a @entity76 leader in @entity66 from the 1960s to the 1980s as well as holding a role as supervisor at the local swimming baths			2
ms @entity44 said : ' the son told his parents in 2009 that the defendant had done things to him sexually			1
' despite support from his parents he did n’t want to go to police at the time but his dad did want to do something about it and contacted police			0
' it was n’t until 2010 that he gave an account to police			0
officers went to speak to his parents and his dad was interviewed			0
' he ( the father ) went on to tell police how he knew @entity3 and how he went to the leisure centre as a teenager every day			2
' the defendant worked at the pool and would let him into the pool free of charge			2
he told police how he went to the defendant ’s flat and watched a soft porn film with him			0
' once he started looking back at what had happened all that time ago it all came out			0
' @entity3 is alleged to have let the father swim at the @entity65 , in @entity66 , free of charge in return for sexual encounters , it was claimed the prosecutor added the pair performed sex acts on each other in the bar area of the leisure centre when it was empty , the showers , changing room and in the ' plant room ' - an underground room which controlled the pool 's temperature			1
she added the acts also happened one time in the back of the defendant 's @entity127 when it was parked outside the leisure centre			0
the father told police he had n’t thought about these things for 30 years , the court heard			1
' just like his son , he was made to feel this was normal and got cigarettes out of it			0
what teenager would say no to cigarettes , alcohol and porn ? , ' ms @entity44 said			0
thirty years later , in a freak coincidence , @entity3 continued his abusing ways with his former victim ’s son , ' the court heard			1
this time it was at an address in @entity5 , @entity149 in the late 1990s into the early 2000s when the boy was between 12 and 16 years			1
@entity3 denied eight counts of indecent assault , two counts of indecency with a child and one count of rape against the father between 1977 and 1981 , as well as two counts of indecent assault , two counts of indecency with a child and one count of buggery against the son between 1998 and 2001 , when he appeared at @entity5 , sitting at @entity168 , @entity149			1
he also denied two counts of indecent assault against another man dating back to the late 1970s and early 1980s			1
the jury heard that @entity22 had been a @entity76 leader in @entity66 from the 1960s to the 1980s as well as holding a role as supervisor at the local swimming baths			0
the jury of seven men and five women took six hours and 55 minutes to return their verdicts			0
@entity3 , of @entity181 , @entity66 , was found guilty on all counts except the rape of the father			1
judge @entity185 , on sentencing @entity22 to 14 years , said : ' it is difficult to put into words the damage that you have done to the family			0
' you preyed upon these three adolescents between the ages of 10 to teenage years			0
' you gave ready accommodation through occasional alcohol , but more often than not , money and sweets so that there was an enticement to people of that age to succumb to your perverted desires			0
' watching ( the father ’s ) evidence it seems to me as it must have to the jury that there was a man who was struggling internally with extraordinary tensions			0
' and then finding his son , who had been estranged for years who had returned to the fold , had been abused by you too			2
' what was he to do ? keep it inside him which he had done for 30 years ? deal with it , pretending it never happened - the way in which some people deal with this ? or disclose it all ? ' i ca n’t think of a worse case of length of behaviour , type of behaviour and impact			1
and the fact they were willing participants is not mitigating at all			0
' that ’s what people like you do			0
they pick their target and abuse their target			0
' @entity3 was put on the sex register for life , disqualified from working with children and given a @entity238 banning him from being alone with children under 16 years .			1
