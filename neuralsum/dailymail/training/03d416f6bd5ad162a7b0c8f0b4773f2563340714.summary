one spring day about 42,000 years ago , a herd of woolly mammoths was grazing near what would one day be called the @entity5 river in northwestern @entity6			1
back then , during the @entity9 age , this was no frozen wasteland but fertile steppe , with plenty of succulent grasses and plants for the huge mammals to feast on			2
munching with the herd was a mother accompanied by her newborn calf			2
experts thinks she fell into a sticky mud hole and choked to death , leaving her mother to grieve for her , 42,000 years ago at just a month old , the tiny female was too young to eat foliage and instead was relying on a combination of her mother ’s milk and excrement			2
at some point the mother approached the river , either to wade and drink or simply to cross it with the rest of the herd			2
it was a move that would prove disastrous for her calf			2
the banks were a sticky wet mass of sand and clay			2
the adult mammoths , standing up to 11ft tall , could easily plough through the quagmire but for this young @entity53 , just 33 inches high , the banks were perilous			1
within seconds the calf became trapped			2
desperately she tried to free herself , but as she twisted and contorted her body was only embedded deeper into the mud			2
it is likely that the calf called out to her mother , who would have come charging towards her baby			2
but if such maternal help did arrive , it came too late			2
the riverbank swiftly claimed its victim , filling the calf ’s throat with mud and choking the poor creature to death			0
the mother surely wanted to stay but the herd was moving on and she had to move with it			0
such cruel events have been common in @entity73 for millions of years			0
doubtless many young mammoths perished in such a way , as some baby elephants do today			1
but there is something special about this particular @entity25 mammoth			0
for , from tomorrow , visitors to the @entity26 in @entity21 will be able to see her almost perfectly preserved and complete remains			1
a desperate death : scientists believe that @entity19 ( pictured ) fell into a mud hole beside an ancient river bank and choked to death			1
the baby mammoth 's trunk , mouth , oesophagus and trachea were all clogged with sediment , suggesting she choked to death or was asphyxiated the world 's most complete mammoth has gone on show at @entity21 's @entity26			1
here , the ancient animal is in her custom case being transported to the museum it 's as if she is sleeping : the baby mammoth ( pictured ) was plucked from the @entity6 permafrost where she has hidden for 42,000 years astonishingly , despite lying in the @entity6 wilderness for about 420 centuries , the calf — called ‘ @entity108 ’ — looks as though she died only a few weeks ago			1
although most of her hair has rotted away , leaving her looking more like her cousin the elephant , she is the most intact mammoth ever found			1
while the discovery tells us much about how her species lived , this 50kg prehistoric carcass also reveals , as we shall see , plenty about the greedy nature of @entity122			0
and it raises an extraordinary question : could some of this baby ’s dna be extracted and the mammoth brought back to life ? @entity19 was found exactly seven years ago by a @entity6 reindeer breeder called @entity53 , who was on a hunting expedition with his three sons			1
when he first spotted the bald corpse on a sandbar in the river , @entity53 initially suspected that she was an elephant			0
however , it quickly dawned on him that he had made an amazing discovery — an entire mammoth			0
most people would have rejoiced at such a find , but this hunter was less than thrilled			0
@entity53 is one of the nomadic @entity143 people , who regard finding mammoth remains as bad luck			0
scientists examined @entity19 's baby teeth to discover that she spent 22 months in the womb - the same amount of time as a modern elephant			1
a ' growth line ' ( labelled ) in the dentine shows she was born in spring and was just 35 days old when she die members of the public will be able to see @entity19 's pristinely preserved body when it forms the centrepiece of an exhibition called @entity160 : @entity161 , which opens on 23 may			1
it will run until 7 september			1
a close - up of her eye area is pictured according to their folklore , mammoths are controlled by underworld gods and in some instances can bring an early death to those who touch them			1
despite his misgivings , @entity53 knew that what he had stumbled across was important , so he drove his snowmobile some 90 miles across the permafrost to a town called @entity177 , from where he boarded a helicopter to take him to @entity180 , the capital of the @entity182			0
there , @entity53 visited the director of the museum , who decided to act quickly			0
within hours @entity53 , the director and some policemen flew to the spot where the mammoth was lying — only to find that it had disappeared			0
while @entity53 despaired , the sceptical director and policemen flew back to @entity180			0
keen to prove that he was not a fantasist , @entity53 made some enquiries and it soon emerged that the mammoth had been taken by his cousin , who had sold it to a shopkeeper in @entity177 for two years ’ supplies of food			0
@entity53 rushed to the store , where he saw the mammoth carelessly propped up on the floor			0
some stray dogs had chewed off most of an ear and the mammoth ’s tail			0
@entity53 managed to persuade the shop owner that his purchase was too important to be treated as a giant canine chew , and with the assistance of local police the baby was taken to the @entity215 in @entity216			0
the exhibition is the first opportunity for people to see the baby mammoth ( pictured ) in @entity221 and it also includes realistic life - sized models and skeletons of mammoths and their relatives @entity19 ( pictured ) who is housed in a glass case in the exhibition , measures 33inches ( 85cm ) tall and 51 inches ( 130cm ) long - a little larger than a dog professor @entity229 said that ancient humans used mammoths for much more than food and there is a ' lot of evidence of interaction '			1
tusks were used for carving into spearheads , bone was used in the construction of huts in central @entity221 and fur for warmth			0
here , a @entity245 mammoth is pictured alongside a tiger it was there that the mammoth was named @entity19 , after @entity53 ’s wife			1
she was reportedly less than delighted , as she too shared the @entity143 ’ belief that mammoth corpses are bad omens			0
the find caused shockwaves across the academic community			0
scans showed that not only was the exterior of @entity19 ’s body more or less whole , but so too were her internal organs			1
her throat and lungs showed traces of mud and clay , which proved that she had been asphyxiated			0
@entity19 ’s intestine also revealed that she had been eating excrement , perhaps that of her mother			1
for students of giant mammals this was not a surprising detail , as today ’s elephants do the same , in order to build up the necessary microbes needed to digest plant matter			0
on her exterior , scientists were also intrigued to discover that @entity19 ’s trunk has two small flaps , or flanges , that have been seen once before on the remains of the trunk of an adult mammoth			1
nobody knows exactly what these were for , though some scientists speculate that they might have been used for scooping snow			2
the researchers also unearthed clues to how @entity19 had been so fantastically preserved			1
it appeared that lactobacillus microbes in the water had actually pickled her body , which was then frozen in the permafrost			0
@entity19 's body was preserved when it sank into mud which later froze			1
it has been buried for 40,000 years in a vacuum , which has meant that oxygen has not decomposed the remains the little mammoth was discovered near the @entity306 ( marked ) in @entity6 , @entity307 in may 2007 now that she is on display , @entity19 is no longer frozen and is instead preserved in @entity309 , and flown around the world in what resembles a large executive briefcase			1
at 33in ( 85cm ) tall and 51in ( 130cm ) long , @entity19 is little larger than a dog			1
because she almost looks asleep , it is tempting to wonder whether creatures such as @entity19 really could be cloned and brought back to life in a @entity318 version of @entity319			1
dr @entity320 , the @entity26 ’s dwarf elephant expert , has her doubts			1
‘ in order to produce a clone of @entity108 , ’ she says , ‘ you would need to have really high - quality nuclear dna [ located within the nucleus of cells ]			2
however , because @entity19 did partially decompose before the pickling and freezing process , there is too much cell and dna damage to make cloning viable			1
’ what ’s more , like many experts , dr @entity320 also has severe ethical doubts about any attempt to bring back the mammoth			2
the discovery by @entity341 and his sons , one of whom is pictured with the mammoth , was a complete accident the discovery in 2007 caused excitement in the scientific community because of @entity19 's completeness			1
here , scientists make observations in @entity6 where the body was found to do so would involve using an @entity354 elephant as a surrogate mother , which would be subjected to a lifetime of testing and invasive procedures			1
‘ do n’t forget , ’ says dr @entity320 , ‘ mammoths are about as closely related to elephants as we are to chimpanzees			2
implanting a mammoth into an elephant would therefore be like implanting a chimpanzee into a human female			0
’ dr @entity320 also wonders what recreating the mammoth would actually achieve in scientific terms			0
‘ what would we actually learn if we did this ? ’ she asks			0
‘ what ’s the benefit for humanity ? ’ even if we humans are unlikely to bring back the mammoth , it looks as if our fascination with the hairy giant is set to continue			0
sadly , however , the reason for this may be more financial than scientific			0
in the past five years as many mammoths have been unearthed as were found in the previous 50			1
this is partly due to the melting permafrost , but also because there is now an increasing number of mammoth hunters , who sell mammoth ivory at £ 350 a kilo			0
in a typical year the @entity392 alone buy some 60 tonnes of this ivory .			2

@entity19 was one year old when she froze in what is now northwest @entity6
shocked scientists found her organs are perfectly preserved
it has now *sparked* an ethical *debate* over what it would mean to clone her
