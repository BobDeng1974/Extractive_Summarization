the Â£ 10million project aims to create a surgical robot hand which could allow a foetus with a congenital condition to have surgery while still in the womb			1
the project is being funded by the @entity17 and the @entity18 , with the research being carried out by engineers at @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity23			1
figures show that one in every 1,000 babies are born with myelomeningocele spina bifida , which is caused when the spine does not form properly			1
researchers hope to develop a pincer , with a miniature camera , which could be inserted into the mother 's womb			2
they hope it would then be able to insert patches over the gaps in the spine to treat the condition			2
the instrument they aim to create will have 3d endoscopic imaging , which will give surgeons accurate detail of the foetus			2
it will also have small tissue manipulators , which will have maximum precision and dexterity			0
a graphic showing how a robot probe could work by photographing the foetus , allowing surgeons to operate surgery could be carried on the foetus , while still in the womb if researchers can develop the tool professor @entity58 told the @entity59 : ' it will be like a plaster			1
if we can do that , there will massive gain for the foetus while there will be little risk to the mother			0
' we are still in the design stage , so we could end up with a device with four or five arms in the end			0
nor would it be used merely to put in patches			0
it could carry out delicate surgery or deliver stem cells to damaged organs			0
' the condition spina bifida is caused during the first month of the embryo 's development			1
symptoms of the condition can include learning difficulties , paralysis of the lower limbs and incontinence .			0
