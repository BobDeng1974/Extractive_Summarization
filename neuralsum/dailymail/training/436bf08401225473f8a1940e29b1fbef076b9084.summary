e-cigarettes have been touted as a ‘ safer ’ alternative for smokers , but a new study indicates that this may not be the case			2
sales of e-cigarettes have soared by 340 per cent in the past year as @entity8 turn to the electronic smoking devices in a bid to quit traditional cigarettes			1
now , a study examining the biological effects of e-cigarettes found ‘ strikingly similar ’ gene mutations in lung cells exposed to e-cig vapour as those found in smokers			1
risky puff : scientists at @entity23 , @entity21 found ' strikingly similar ' gene mutations in lung cells exposed to e-cig vapour as in those exposed to tobacco smoke scientists grew bronchial cells in mediums exposed to e-cig vapour and compared them to bronchial cells grown in a medium exposed to tobacco smoke			1
they found that the gene mutations in both sets of cells , although not identical , showed ‘ striking similarities ’			0
‘ [ e-cigarettes ] may be safer , but our preliminary studies suggest that they may not be benign , ’ said study author @entity37 , a genomics and lung cancer researcher at @entity23			2
this means that although e-cigarette vapour is tobacco and tar - free and that the device does not require combustion , it could potentially increase a user ’s risk of cancer			0
mr @entity52 , who presented the study ’s findings at the @entity56 ’s annual meeting this week , said he could not confirm or deny that e-cigarettes cause cancer , as the research is in its early stages			0
still unknown : the new research means e-cigarettes may be safer than normal tobacco cigarettes , but not as harmless as we first thought e-cigarettes have soared in popularity in recent years as consumers look for ‘ healthier ’ ways to continue smoking , rather than use gum or patches to quit the habit			1
figures released last month found that while sales of smoking quitting aids have slowed , the market for e-cigarettes is booming			0
sales have increased by 340 per cent over the past year , from £ 44 million in 2012 to reach an estimated £ 193 million in 2013			1
the report says that while the smoking cessation market has seen strong growth historically , with annual increases of around 6 - 10 per cent between 2009 - 12 , sales of products such as gum , tablets and patches have slowed			0
in 2013 the market for smoking cessation aids grew just 1.7 per cent to reach a value of £ 131 million .			0

electronic cigarettes may not be as safe as first thought
scientists grew bronchial cells exposed to vapour and tobacco smoke
lung cells develop similar mutations when exposed to e-cig vapor
this means they might be ' safer ' than cigarettes , but not harmless
sales of e-cigarettes increased by 340 per cent in @entity8 alone last year
