by @entity0 published : 11:35 est , 8 january 2014 updated : 03:57 est , 9 january 2014 his home is a graveyard , his job , shoplifting and his skin , cracked and pitted with psoriasis - the result of sleeping rough and a raging addiction to heroin and crack			1
@entity11 , a 30 - something from @entity14 's @entity13 , is just one of the estimated 600,000 illegal immigrants currently thought to live in @entity16			1
but as new @entity20 documentary , @entity17 of @entity16 's @entity18 , reveals , the @entity16 dream all too often proves a nightmare			0
bleak : @entity20 inside @entity11 's dilapidated squat before he is thrown out and forced to sleep rough along with @entity11 , others to appear in the film , which focuses on the @entity27 borough of @entity28 , include @entity29 , another @entity31 rough sleeper who has resorted to industrial quantities of alcohol to get through the day , and @entity35 , a persistent thief			1
yet despite their appalling living conditions and inability to get a job , the men say they would prefer stay in the @entity16 rather than lose face by returning home to their families empty handed			2
' i am crazy for drugs			0
i do not look after myself or my body , ' @entity11 reveals			1
' but i do n't have the willpower [ to stop ]			2
he adds : ' i am ashamed to go home and you know why ? i have been here nine years and i have f * * * ing zero			2
' i do n't want to go to @entity14 like this , never , ever			1
really , i need to stop the drugs			0
i 'm finished man , i 'm finished			0
finished , finished , finished			0
' @entity55 : like this group of migrants found camping in a @entity59 underpass , @entity11 sleeps rough problem : a quarter of @entity27 's homeless are from @entity63 , including the @entity64 of @entity65 but it is n't just migrants from @entity14 and @entity68 who arrive to discover that the @entity16 is a far less welcoming place than they anticipated			1
eastern @entity72 now make up a quarter of @entity27 's rough sleepers , and @entity75 @entity74 is one of them			1
she came to the @entity16 with the help of a fixer who had promised her a job but he soon disappeared , leaving her to struggle alone			0
as an @entity82 citizen , @entity74 is entitled to benefits but is filmed sleeping rough while she and her husband wait for the payments to begin			1
' i was thinking @entity88 might be easier , you [ can ] find work easier , ' she explains , but as a former heroin addict with a conviction for shoplifting , getting a job has proved difficult			1
she adds : ' of course we are sad about the situation			0
' difficult : many who overstay are not picked up because the @entity97 does n't monitor exit records when @entity20 returns three months later , the pair are still unemployed but have moved into a house paid for by their benefits			1
' every week we get £ 72 [ each ]			2
so £ 100 for @entity104 [ their landlord ] and £ 44 for us			2
in @entity75 we do n't have anything like this			2
' although the pair say they are searching for work , @entity74 admits she turned down a cleaning job in a hotel because of an old injury picked up while addicted to drugs			1
by contrast , @entity11 and his friends are desperate for work but find it even more of a struggle thanks to their lack of work visas			1
' nowadays everybody is scared , ' explains @entity11			2
' if they find [ an ] illegal immigrant in any job , [ the employer is given a ] £ 10,000 fine			1
that 's why they do n't give job to anyone without passport or visa			0
' for some , the answer is to throw in the towel and go home			0
among those to choose voluntary repatriation is @entity139 , a former @entity140 soldier			2
' i have never stolen anything , i have never gone to jail , ' he tells @entity20			0
' i do not have any such record - i have a clean record here			0
complaints : shopkeepers in @entity28 have complained about the antisocial behaviour of @entity11 and his friends ' there is a rule in the [ @entity14 ] army that if you come home in nine years , your pension continues			1
that 's why i want to get home			0
' @entity158 , an elder and magistrate at @entity28 's @entity161 temple , which provides food for unlucky migrants such as @entity139 , thinks he 's making the right decision			1
a third generation @entity166 , mr @entity158 is proud of his father and grandfather 's contribution to the @entity16 , including stints fighting for the @entity171 in the @entity172 , but says he feels threatened by the antisocial behaviour of @entity11 and his friends			2
' this is my country			0
i need a visa to go somewhere else but i do n't need a visa to be here , ' he explains			0
' i 'm not saying they 're bad people			0
it 's the system that has allowed them to be trafficked and brought over here			0
moving on : keane with @entity139 who has now returned home to @entity14 after volunteering for repatriation ' i feel they have a lot of contributions to make to their own countries and they should get back there and do it			1
' for @entity139 , a plane ticket home really is the end of the nightmare but for others , @entity11 among them , things just get worse			1
several months after @entity20 first meets him , he 's been sent to prison after being caught red - handed stealing £ 1,500 of clothes from a local @entity199			0
it 's his fourth prison term and the @entity201 have asked to see his files - the start of the deportation process			0
despite his hopes of a better life , it seems that for @entity11 , his @entity16 nightmare could be coming to an end			1
the @entity17 of @entity16 's @entity18 , tonight at 9.30pm on @entity210			0

among those to appear is @entity11 , a crack addict who sleeps rough
@entity74 , a former addict who now lives on benefits , also features
some go home , among them @entity139 , who says he had a better life in @entity14
*government* has *increased* fine for employing illegal migrants to £ 10,000
@entity11 says this means he ca n't find work and must steal to survive
