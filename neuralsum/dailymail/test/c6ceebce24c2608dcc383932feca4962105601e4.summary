it is claimed that the video , obtained by @entity28 , was taken at his home in @entity30 in the days before a game			2
nitrous oxide starves the brain of oxygen and makes users feel light - headed and dizzy			1
@entity0 scored in last night ’s 2 - 0 victory over @entity37 but he also missed a chance from six yards in the 56th minute and could now face disciplinary action after his second indiscretion in the space of 24 hours			1
@entity4 forward @entity0 can be seen pictured on social media whilst smoking a shisha pipe @entity0 scored the opening goal in monday night ’s 2 - 0 victory over @entity37 @entity47 , has been nicknamed ‘ laughing gas ’ due to the euphoric and relaxed feeling people who inhale it can sometimes feel			1
the gas is normally bought in pressured canisters , commonly transferred to a container , e.g. a balloon , from which the gas is inhaled			0
nitrous oxide is not illegal to possess , but this does n’t mean that it is safe to use			1
the effects of nitrous oxide vary depending on how much has been inhaled but they include : feelings of euphoria , relaxation and calmness			1
dizziness , difficulty in thinking straight and fits of giggles / laughter			0
sound distortions or even hallucinations			0
in some people , a headache can be an unwanted immediate effect			0

any subsequent action will be taken internally			0
’ @entity91 contacted @entity0 ’s agent , @entity92 , last night			2

asked if he will be reminding @entity0 of his responsibilities , @entity4 manager @entity105 said : ‘ i will do			1
he ’s a young kid who has been in the spotlight now so he knows the demands of being a top class professional — it ’s not just on the field it ’s off the field , but i will speak with him on it and we ’ll move on			0
’ @entity91 columnist and former @entity4 captain @entity116 said : ‘ in years to come he ’ll look back over this period now as a massive learning curve			2
when you ’re a 20 - year - old kid , you make mistakes			1
i did , i ’m sure we all do			0
it ’s just important that he learns from it because @entity0 needs to be on the back pages , not the front pages and that ’s a problem for him in these last few months			2
’ @entity128 chief @entity127 called for understanding after @entity0 ' made a mistake '			2
@entity127 , deputy chief executive of the @entity131 and @entity133 president of the international players ' union @entity134 , said people should not be too hard on @entity0			2
he said : ' nobody would condone the use of these types of substances whether legal or otherwise as footballers are seen as role models			0
it does send a message to young people that if it 's good enough for footballers then it 's good enough for them and that is not desirable			0
the 20 - year - old recently snubbed a £ 100,000 - a - week contract offer from the @entity153 club ' but you have to bear in mind that we ask an awful lot of young players growing up in the public eye			1
many of us look back at things we have done in our teens and early 20s and wish we had n't done them			0
' he 's made a mistake and people are human			0
i am sure this will be a minor blip on his path to a fantastic career			0
' players have to be aware that there is camera on every corner - they are very much in the spotlight			2
' he 's a young man , growing up in public eye and he 's made a mistake			0
let 's not be too hard on the boy			0
he is under a lot of pressure and people think because he has a lot of talent he 's also supposed to have diplomacy and wisdom			0
' in the main he 's doing a very good job , he 's at a good club and has a good manager and i 'm sure @entity105 will put his arm around him and at the same time make him aware of his responsibilities			2
' nitrous oxide has been nicknamed ‘ laughing gas ’ due to the euphoric and relaxed feeling people who inhale it can sometimes feel			1
official figures show 460,000 16 - 24 years olds took it last year			2
@entity105 has backed his wayward star but contract stand - off has created tension at @entity4 it has been the cause of 17 deaths since 2006			1
it costs around £ 2 to buy and is not illegal to possess — @entity0 is not the first footballer to be caught indulging			2
drugs charity @entity211 has called on the ' role model ' player to condemn the use of the drug to deter young supporters from taking risks with their health			2
the anti-drugs organisation 's spokesman , @entity219 , told @entity221 : ' it 's very disappointing from our point of view			0
he is a big role model and we hate to see this kind of stuff from someone of his status			0
' players in similar situations in the past have come out and apologised and we hope he does the same			0
' @entity47 is not the most dangerous drug out there but there are deaths attached to it			0
there are risks and we would urge anyone tempted to take it not to do so			0
' @entity243 defender @entity242 was pictured inhaling a balloon in 2013 , while last year @entity245 was pictured doing it at the wheel of his @entity248			1
in february , @entity249 faced criticism after he was pictured with a shisha pipe on a night out while recovering from ankle surgery			1
but the @entity254 star , who has previously been pictured smoking cigarettes , was defended by @entity6 manager @entity256 who said he 'd tried the @entity258 pipe himself and did not think it was a problem			1
the past two months have proved to be a tempestuous period in @entity0 ’s fledgling career and the revelations of the past two days have ensured extra scrutiny			2
the @entity6 international ( right ) played in the @entity265 @entity264 quarter final win over @entity266 on wednesday @entity0 ( second right ) attended the launch of the 2015 - 16 @entity4 kit at @entity270 on friday afternoon there was a large turnout for the launch of the new kit , which will be worn throughout the 2015 - 16 season @entity6 and @entity254 midfielder @entity249 ( right ) was involved in a smoking controversy in february @entity0 ’s contract stand - off with @entity4 has created tension and he was heckled at the launch of the club ’s new kit last week			1
