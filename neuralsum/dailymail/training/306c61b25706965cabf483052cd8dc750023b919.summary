by @entity0 published : 07:18 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 07:21 est , 15 november 2012 she ’s been dazzling male viewers with her array of bikinis and generous curves - but it seems not everyone is impressed by her shower scenes , as it is reported that i ’m a celebrity star @entity11 has been named as the nation ’s biggest hd horror			1
the former @entity15 actress topped the poll of famous faces who look worse in hd than they do in standard definition			2
former prima ballerina and @entity22 judge @entity21 was the second biggest hd disappointment , closely followed by x factor judge @entity25 and fashion maven @entity27			1
although her shower scenes on i 'm a celebrity may have impressed , @entity11 was voted the celebrity who looks worst in high definition @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 were the male celebrities who viewers said look even worse in hd than they do in standard definition			1
but some celebs were judged to look even better in high definition with @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 topping the list of hd heroines			2
@entity45 gymnast turned @entity22 star @entity46 and all of @entity48 were named as the male celebrities who looked best in @entity19			2
one survey respondent said : ' @entity11 has an amazing figure but @entity19 does her skin no favours			0
i suppose there ’s no way to hide behind make up when you ’re in the middle of the jungle			0
' another voter said : ' i love @entity22 and @entity21 has added a new credibility to the show but viewed on @entity62 she looks ten years older than on @entity63			1
the hd pictures can be cruel			0
' @entity25 and @entity31 were also classed as ' hd horrors ' a male respondent added : ' for me @entity39 is the celeb who looks even better in hd than she does in @entity68 – and that is saying something			1
' a female @entity72 fan who took part in the survey said : ' @entity25 was voted the most beautiful woman in the world last year but see her in hd and she ai n’t all that			1
she ’s covered in moles which do n’t show up in @entity68			2
' another female voter said : ' @entity31 looks like he ’s overdone the @entity80 to me			1
seen in @entity19 the full horror is there for all to see			0
he ’s like @entity86 ’s slightly younger brother			0
' @entity39 and the @entity40 were voted as the hd delights by tv fans @entity89 stressed that the survey was n’t a poll on attractiveness but was designed to highlight which famous names delight or disappoint when viewed in high definition			0
a spokesman said : ' often it ’s things like skin tones which are most dramatically revealed			0
while famous faces often insist on being airbrushed for magazine photo shoots there really is no place to hide from a high definition television camera			0
' so we thought it would be interesting to ask our users which celebs they thought looked even better in hd over @entity68 and which looked worse			0
' @entity11 ( 14 per cent ) @entity21 ( 10 per cent ) @entity25 ( 9 per cent ) @entity31 ( 8 per cent ) @entity32 ( 7 per cent ) @entity33 ( 6 per cent ) @entity27 ( 5 per cent ) @entity109 ( 4 per cent ) @entity110 ( @entity111 ) ( 3 per cent ) @entity112 ( 2 per cent ) @entity39 ( 13 per cent ) @entity40 ( 11 per cent ) @entity48 ( 9 per cent ) @entity46 ( 8 per cent ) @entity41 ( 6 per cent ) @entity113 ( 5 per cent ) @entity114 ( 4 per cent ) @entity115 ( 3 per cent ) @entity116 ( 3 per cent ) @entity117 ( 3 per cent )			1

@entity21 and @entity27 also big hd disappointments
