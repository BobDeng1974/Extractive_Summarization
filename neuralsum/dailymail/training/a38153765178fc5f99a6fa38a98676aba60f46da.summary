crossword addict : chimpanzees love having their brains teased and enjoy getting stuck into a puzzle - with or without the opportunity to win a prize , research has shown to achieve their goal , players had to prod sticks into holes in the pipes to change the direction of the dice			1
the same task was also carried out using brazil nuts instead of dice , so that success led to a tasty treat			1
researcher @entity37 , from the @entity38 , said : ' we noticed that the chimps were keen to complete the puzzle regardless of whether or not they received a food reward			2
' this strongly suggests they get similar feelings of satisfaction to humans who often complete brain games for a feel - good reward			0
' the chimpanzees , all members of an adult family group at the zoo , did not receive advance training on how to play the game			2
' for chimps in the wild , this task is a little bit like foraging for insects or honey inside a tree stump or a termite mound , except more challenging because the dice to not stick to the tool , ' said ms @entity37			1
like humans , chimpanzees are motivated to solve a puzzle for its own sake , without needing a food reward , said the researchers the findings are published today in the @entity74			0
researchers created higher ' levels ' of challenge by connecting many pipes together , and making them opaque so the dice or nuts could only be glimpsed through small holes			1
the apes were given complete freedom whether or not to pit their wits in the puzzle , said the scientists			2
they chose to take part in the game despite also receiving treats hidden in boxes as part of the zoo 's enrichment programme			0
