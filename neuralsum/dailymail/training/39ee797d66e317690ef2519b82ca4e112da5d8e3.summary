@entity0 , pictured , held 12 secret meetings with @entity2 and @entity3			1
he was repeatedly questioned by security officials between 1997 and 2003 the full extent of @entity0 ’s contact with @entity8 security services was revealed last night			1
the hook - handed cleric held 12 secret meetings with @entity2 and @entity3			2
he was repeatedly questioned by security officials between 1997 and 2003 – the year before he was finally arrested for inciting murder			1
the revelations came after it was claimed at his @entity15 terror trial that he acted as an intermediary between @entity3 and @entity18 fanatics to ‘ keep the streets of @entity20 safe ’			1
@entity22 officials confirmed the extent of the contact between @entity0 and police and security agents , which involved nine meetings in 1997 and 1998 alone			1
but they downplayed suggestions that a deal had been done to protect @entity0 from arrest in return for information on terror plots or help in smoothing community relations			1
senior sources suspect @entity0 of trying to re-write his past for the court ’s benefit			2
he could be jailed for life in the @entity42 if charges of hostage - taking and trying to set up a terrorist training camp in @entity46 , @entity47 , are proved			0
yesterday , @entity0 sobbed in the witness box at @entity49 as he addressed two of the most notorious episodes from his past			2
for years , followers believed he had stood alongside mujahideen fighters in @entity54 in the 1980s against the occupying @entity55 and had lost his arms in a landmine blast			0
but @entity0 claimed that , in fact , his arms were blown off while he was working on a road project in @entity60 in 1993 when he tried to throw a container of explosives away			1
he later had hooks fitted by the @entity64 , he said			0
the fanatic also said that in @entity54 , he had not been a rebel fighter but a health and safety officer ensuring that trenches did not collapse			0
‘ i was responsible for health and safety of the mujahideen , ’ he said			0
there was a moment of levity when @entity0 told the court that he had obtained a passport with a new name to deliver aid supplies to @entity80 forces in @entity81 in 1994 as the situation there was so dangerous for @entity84			1
‘ it is very simple in @entity8 , ’ he said			2
‘ you pay £ 25 and you say you want to be @entity87 and you become @entity87			0
’ district judge @entity88 then asked : ‘ and did you become @entity87 ? ’ he replied			0
’ @entity0 said his only involvement with the @entity54 conflict was to ‘ fire a few bullets at the @entity94 regime ’			2
sobbing on the stand : a sketch of @entity0 giving evidence at his trial in @entity15 as he faces @entity42 terrorism charges he added that his ‘ reputation is much , much bigger than the reality ’			1
during a sometimes emotional testimony , he banged his stumps on the witness box			0
he also broke down in tears as he talked about the massacre of @entity107 in @entity108 in @entity81 in 1995			0
the judge called a seven - minute break and @entity0 , who had a red nose from sobbing , left the court to compose himself			2
on wednesday , lawyers for @entity0 told of his claim that he had been working with @entity3 , while running the notorious @entity117 mosque in north @entity20			1
@entity0 had previously claimed – at his 2005/6 trial in @entity8 for using his sermons to incite murder – that his preaching had been tacitly approved by @entity3			1
he said he had been approached in 1997 by officers from @entity3 who had indicated that his speeches did not break the law , but that position had changed in 2000			1
@entity0 told the court : ‘ i said , “ my sermons , is it a problem ? ” they said , “ well , it ’s freedom of speech , you do n’t have to worry as long as we do n’t see blood on the streets ”			1
only in 2000 they said , “ we think you are walking on a tightrope ”			0
they said there were some things that they do n’t like			0
’ but just how much contact @entity0 had with the security services is only now emerging			1
between 1997 and 1998 there were six meetings between @entity144 and an @entity3 officer and , separately , three meetings with @entity2			2
he met @entity3 and @entity2 again in 2000 and had a final meeting with the police in 2003			2
despite the number of meetings , @entity22 sources cast doubt on @entity0 ’s claims			2
@entity80 cleric , @entity0 , pictured here in 2002			0
@entity22 officials have confirmed the extent of the contact between @entity0 and police and security agents , which involved nine meetings in 1997 and 1998 alone officials point out that , when trying to overturn his @entity8 convictions in 2006 , he had made similar claims to appeal judges			1
in that case , the court had access to transcripts of the meetings between @entity144 and security officials but flatly rejected his argument he had been promised protection from prosecution			1
the links between @entity0 and other fanatics , and the security officials have fuelled speculation of a so - called ‘ covenant of security ’			1
the deal allegedly allowed radical clerics to encourage @entity18 attacks abroad			0
in return , it was hoped there would be no attacks on targets in @entity8			0
there have also been claims that police and the security services ‘ tolerated ’ @entity0 because his mosque became a ‘ honeypot ’ for @entity18 fanatics – allowing officials to keep tabs on those coming and going and put them under surveillance			1
at least four @entity201 - trained terrorists who failed in major plots ‘ came under @entity0 ’s spell ’			0
they were @entity204 shoe - bomber @entity203 , @entity205 grammar school boy and reluctant shoe - bomber @entity203 , police killer and ricin poison plotter @entity208 and the ‘ 20th ’ september 11 hijacker , @entity210			0
@entity0 denies the 11 kidnapping and terrorism charges he faces in the @entity42 , where he was extradited in 2012 after a lengthy battle			0
the court has yet to decide if documents relating to his meetings with police and @entity3 will be admissible .			0
