it is a national institution that has seen some big changes over the last few years			0
in a bid to keep up with the changing times the @entity5 movement have introduced ‘ body confidence training ’ , scrapped the reference to @entity8 in their promise , and perhaps most controversially hired a former abortion rights campaigner as their chief executive			2
now , for only the eighth time in their hundred year history the @entity5 uniform is also getting a major revamp			1
it is the first time the @entity5 uniform has been updated in fourteen years and to give the range a youthful touch the organisation brought in a team of five female designers from @entity47			1
fashion students @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 spent a year speaking to groups of current guides aged 10 - 14 about what they wanted to wear			1
the conclusion was a focus on comfort and flexibility but also to preserve their own style and not look ‘ too boyish			1
’ princesses @entity60 and @entity61 during their time as @entity5 in 1943			2
the uniform they wore had not changed much since the 1920s they way they were : guides looking smart in the 1970s it ’s been almost fifteen years since the decision was taken to allow girl guides to wear jeans – so long as they were blue - as part of their uniform and this latest remodel sees a further move towards a much more casual style			1
girls now have a choice of long and short - sleeved tops to wear with trousers , leggings , skirts , jeans and shorts as well as a uniform dress and skirt			1
the utilitarian designs come in sky blue with bright red cuffs and sleeves and girls can choose how to mix and match their uniform - a far cry from the strict uniform standards of previous generations			2
from today the polo shirt , £ 12.50 , and hoodie , £ 20 , will be available for the first time with the rest of the range due to be released in october			0
chief guide , @entity102 said : ‘ we ’re exceptionally proud of the young women who have taken such care over this project			0
we are thrilled with the designs - they ’re fresh , young and versatile			0
’ revamp : a major change came in 1990 when @entity108 launched the first attempt at modernising the uniform including for the first time polo shirts , sweatshirts , jogging bottoms and t - shirts @entity115 tastes : in 1998 this more casual approach was confirmed with the introduction of blue jeans and again in 2000 when fashion designer @entity119 added a rugby shirt and body - warmer to the range the @entity5 were founded in 1910 as the answer for girls to the rapidly - growing boy scout movement			1
girls were keen to join on the activities already enjoyed by their brothers but @entity130 founder @entity129 disapproved of mixing the sexes so his sister @entity132 helped set up a girl ’s equivalent called the @entity5			2
at the start of the movement uniforms were mostly homemade and often brown like the uniforms of the @entity130 ’ but varied hugely depending on what was available - many were in fact uniforms outgrown by the early guide ’s brothers which they customised to fit them			0
by the 1920s a uniform of navy dresses or a navy blouse and skirt had emerged , worn with a scarf folded into a tie and broad - brimmed hat had emerged and these began to be embellished with badges			0
over the next few decades the uniform remained largely unchanged although skirts shortened to knee length and the navy was replaced with a brighter blue			0
the next major change came in 1990 when @entity159 launched the first attempt at modernising the uniform including for the first time polo shirts , sweatshirts , jogging bottoms and t - shirts			1
in 1998 this more casual approach was confirmed with the introduction of blue jeans and again in 2000 when fashion designer @entity119 added a rugby shirt and body - warmer to the range .			0
