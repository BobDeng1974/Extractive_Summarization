optimism has repeatedly proved unfounded in the past , so this year , this column is approaching the autumn tests with a glass - half - empty outlook – when it comes to the hopes of the home nations			1
over the next month , the full might of the southern - hemisphere elite will be showcased in @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			0
on nine occasions , they will face @entity16 and @entity17 challenges to their global supremacy and all the indications are that they will once again fly back across the equator with more wins than losses			2
so many times in recent years , there has been a heartening sense of the perennial north v south gap narrowing , but it is hard to argue that case this time			0
the @entity30 countries continue to dominate their annual clashes with @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			0
@entity36 , seen as the weakest of the big three , will be galvanized with @entity37 now in charge the latest @entity39 once again delivered standards of intensity and skill which set the competing teams apart from their @entity45 rivals			1
@entity47 ’s epic victory over @entity48 was a vivid example of the apparently enduring gulf , while even stricken @entity36 so nearly raised themselves to sufficient heights to beat the world champions			1
as is so often the scenario , the @entity36 arrive on these shores as the perceived weakest link , but with @entity37 now in charge they are likely to be galvanised			1
the @entity48 and @entity47 , meanwhile , have exerted a hold over the home nations and even end - of - season weariness may not be enough to break that cycle			1
where will the northern wins occur ? if the @entity16 and @entity65 finished with a win - count of five from their nine clashes with the big three touring teams , it would represent encouraging progress , but the omens are not good			2
@entity32 's injury problems , especially in the front five , will be a problem against a powerful @entity75 side @entity32 have the strongest pedigree when it comes to claiming southern scalps , but they start the autumn with a multitude of injuries , especially in the front five – which is bound to be especially telling against the powerful @entity47			1
by then , given the absence of so many leading lights , they may have succumbed to a fourth straight loss to @entity48 in the space of six months			1
it is high time for an end to the damaging period of @entity92 failure against the @entity30 countries , but that will appear as a distant fantasy if they suffer yet another near - miss against the @entity36 next saturday			1
the @entity65 have key injuries and they no longer have @entity99 , while a @entity35 win over the @entity48 would represent one of the greatest upsets of this or any era			1
the head - over - heart prediction is for @entity32 , @entity34 and @entity33 to muster a total of four wins between them			2
at home , that is not enough			2
let ’s hope the glass is fuller than it looks			0
@entity32 have the strongest pedigree when it comes to claiming southern scalps but have injury problems something had to give at @entity116 and , sure enough , it has this week , with backs coach @entity117 leaving the club following a grim 15 - 3 defeat at the @entity120			0
the @entity116 have endured a poor start to the season but @entity117 has been unfortunate to lose his job with the @entity125 side in the midst of a debilitating injury crisis			0
the @entity65 has to operate with a continuously revolving and diminishing cast of fit backs – leading to endless reshuffles and a lack of cohesion			0
at least in the short term , @entity116 will fill the void from within			0
another @entity65 , @entity135 , will take on the role vacated by @entity117 , after assisting him since retiring as a player			0
if the man once dubbed the ‘ @entity140 of rugby ’ by @entity139 can bring the same unorthodox flair to his coaching as he did to his own game as a free - spirit full - back , he will transform the @entity116 ’ attacking game			2
yet , he faces a daunting equation – resources are diminished , but expectations are not			0
@entity117 can consider himself unlucky to have lost his job as backs coach at @entity116 after @entity152 had made his 100th appearance for @entity154 last weekend , he was congratulated by club - mate @entity155 on @entity156 , as he prepared to return home to @entity158 to take on the @entity48			1
the flanker no doubt spoke for the entire @entity32 squad when he said : ‘ good luck next weekend , soften them up for us			0
’ the @entity158 will go toe - to - toe with the world champions in front of a sell - out crowd of 62,000 at @entity167 , @entity168 , tomorrow , a week before @entity48 face @entity170 ’s men at @entity172			1
realistically , the @entity173 ca n’t hope to beat the @entity174 , but they can throw a spanner in the works by targeting @entity177 on his return to union , or shackling @entity180 when he emerges from the bench for his test comeback			0
this fixture is a potentially momentous occasion in the history of @entity158 rugby , so the hosts can benefit from it hugely in the long - term , but in the short - term they could also help @entity45 ’s leading nations by further slowing the @entity48 juggernaut			1
@entity192 flanker @entity152 had made his 100th appearance for @entity154 last weekend @entity193 is heading home to @entity33 after the november international window – a less - than - startling development which was confirmed by his @entity198 club , @entity200			1
it is likely that he will re-surface in @entity202 with the @entity203 , on a dual contract with the @entity205			2
his return home makes sense , as the move across the @entity209 has been an ill - fated exercise			2
in his pomp , @entity193 is a @entity212 and a formidable @entity214 player , but he has been under - valued by his @entity216 employers			2
@entity217 will welcome the blindside flanker back into the @entity92 game with open arms , knowing that there is ample time to repair his confidence and restore his game to its peak before next year ’s @entity226			2
last word – it was somehow inevitable			0
having ignited the rebellion against the @entity45 status quo which led to the creation of the new @entity234 , @entity230 clubs have suffered in the early stages of the new tournament			1
after two rounds of matches , the tally of victories for each of the competing leagues is as follows ; @entity230 five , @entity216 top 14 seven and @entity243 eight			1
the results will be particularly satisfying in @entity34 – whose provinces have claimed four wins in six games – and @entity35 , for whom @entity249 have blazed a trail with back - to - back successes			0
in fact , the latter have generated much of the intrigue so far			0
their 37 - 10 , opening - weekend demolition of @entity257 was arguably the most eye - catching result to date , while @entity261 ’s last - kick win at @entity262 delivered the most remarkable drama of the new event ’s initial encounters			0
pool - stage ‘ derbies ’ may fit in with the heightened meritocracy this year but , as expected , they and the occasionally absurd kick - off times are not a positive development			0
@entity193 is likely to head to the @entity203 after his time with @entity198 club @entity200			1

the home nations are likely to be dominated in the autumn tests
@entity48 , @entity36 and @entity47 will all be too strong
@entity193 likely to head back to @entity203
@entity230 teams behind @entity280 and @entity243 in @entity234
