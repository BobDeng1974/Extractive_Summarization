@entity1 's @entity0 was a sea of bizarre hats today as people celebrating @entity5 took to the streets in outlandish headgear			2
whether they had just emerged from @entity11 , or were only there to bare their bonnets , the quintessential @entity9 thoroughfare thronged with color on sunday afternoon			1
bunny ears , eggs and flowers were among the more conservative adornments festooning the heads of @entity21 as they milled around in a loose gaggle centered on @entity23			1
mad hatters : these parader - goers , pictured in front of @entity23 on @entity1 's @entity0 , were among the more conservative hat - wearers in the annual @entity5 parade flower power : one of these floral bonnets , pictured next to the @entity30 , spouted bubbles into the sunny @entity21 sky classic : some churchgoers wore more somber and refined clothing to the @entity11 service at the @entity38 cathedral feathery : this elaborate piece of headgear was sported by @entity42 at the @entity0 parade on sunday one woman wore a large ship with blue sails on her head , while another sported an elaborate diorama based on the policies of mayor @entity51			1
as well as @entity52 emerging from the service , led by cardinal @entity54 , jews , @entity56 , agnostics and atheists joined the masses for a walk on the mild , sunny day			2
roses , industrial - style black goggles , as well as moving rabbit puppets also featured in the display , which did n't just involve humans			1
@entity67 , a local hatmaker who wore the ship - shaped hat , said : ' it 's all about versatility '			1
explaining the design , she said : ' it 's about sailing to new heights , ' said @entity67			2
she also created headpieces for two friends , one topped with a massive butterfly and another with a tropical umbrella dripping with felt balls and anchored to a bird 's nest			0
just feet from the parade , the trio was tending to last - minute finishing touches , adding bobby pins to make sure the contraptions did n't topple			2
@entity87 , who wore the butterfly , said : ' it 's @entity5 and i did n't want to be too garish			0
but then again , i do have a huge butterfly on my head ! ' ship - shape : hat - maker @entity94 wears an @entity5 bonnet featuring a blue ship , which she fashioned from an elaborate kite elaborate rabbit : this puppet bunny was another of the out - there headpieces seen strutting down @entity0 commentary : this woman 's hat was a diorama inspired by the city 's mayor , @entity51 starting young : @entity110 , held by her father @entity111 , enjoyed the chance to put her bunny ears on parade @entity115 becomes twosie : this rabbit enthusiast was captured next to a mirrored building on the @entity21 street in bloom : these colorful headpieces were typical among the revelers @entity123 : these two women took the egg theme to its logical conclusion , wearing depictions in cooked and raw form the 2015 @entity129 bore little resemblance to the first one , which started in the 1880s as a strolling display of what prosperous @entity21 wore to @entity0 churches			1
in recent decades , the street gathering has morphed into a sort of costume circus - including pet dogs			1
a sizable subsection of dogs also sported elaborate @entity5 costumes , painstakingly designed by their owners - although some were so heavy they animals had to be carried around rather than walk			1
@entity145 , a 4lbs @entity146 , was not exactly happy with her getup			0
' she did n't love this one because it 's kind of heavy , and she wo n't walk in it			0
but if i carry her , she 's fine , ' said owner @entity151			0
a consultant to the city 's @entity153 , @entity151 dabbles in dog attire			0
she used a @entity157 pattern to sew @entity145 's coat from one of her old shirts , adorning it with a flowery headband plus a necklace purchased from a company that makes accessories for tweens			0
and to make sure she did n't run off into the dense crowds , @entity151 kept her on a bejeweled leash			0
as for @entity151 , she wore her mother - in - law 's old @entity5 hat to the parade , a dark red velvet one she 'd pulled out of a closet			2
' i 'm carrying on that tradition , ' said @entity151			0
dog squad : carmen the @entity146 poses with owneer @entity151 at the parade			0
she was apparently not a big fan of the floral outfit , and wo n't walk with it on @entity5 puppy : these two dogs seemed happier with their colorful wings and hats as they joined in with their owners kids , too : @entity185 , left , and her sister @entity187 were also along for the parade , with relatively restrained toppings loopy : @entity191 poses for photographs as he takes part in the @entity129 rising roses : @entity195 poses for photographs with her elaborate , wireframe decoration back in black : @entity200 departed from the bright color scheme , opting for goggle - style shades , a black plume and purple lipstick keeping it straight : @entity206 , right , reties the hat of her aunt @entity208 as they take part in the parade			1
