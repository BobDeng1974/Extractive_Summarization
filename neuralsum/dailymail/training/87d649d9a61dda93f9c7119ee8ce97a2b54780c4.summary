while all attention at @entity2 was focused on whether to allow gay marriage , this @entity0 did something furtive – something that is not only much less liberal , but coldly terrifying			1
under the cover of the furore , it quietly disinterred the corpse of its ‘ @entity9			1
this @entity11 creates extraordinary new legal powers to keep official dealings hidden from us			1
it changes all the comforting certainties about the rule of law in @entity18			2
most of us have some kind of grasp of what is officially called the @entity24			2
the government wants us to think its scope is limited to rare and arcane disputes , perhaps born of foreign battlefields			2
or ones that sound as if they belong in spy novels , involving @entity45 ‘ black ops ’ and ‘ dark jails ’			2
but if it becomes law , the effects will be felt much closer to home			2
the shocking outcome of the recent @entity54 , bringing justice at last to 97 families ? if similar circumstances were to arise again , it is likely that justice would never be delivered : if the families tried to sue , alleging a bungled police operation and a subsequent cover - up , the @entity11 would give the authorities the ability to keep the truth concealed			1
decider : @entity66 @entity65 cast the critical vote on the revised draft of the @entity11 a case brought against the @entity70 by families of soldiers killed in a foreign deployment , alleging their loved ones ’ equipment was defective ? this is not mere hypothesis			1
many argue now that the @entity18 death toll in @entity80 has been higher than it should have been because some of our military vehicles were too vulnerable to roadside bombs			2
with this law enshrined , the government could insist on a closed , secret hearing			2
there , it could present evidence denying such claims			2
no one could challenge it , because no one directly affected by the case would ever know what it was			2
or take the very real , current scandal of the women green activists who unknowingly entered sexual relationships with undercover police officers			0
those defending such a case could be entitled to a secret hearing , at which they could claim that such tactics were entirely justified , on the basis that the women posed some kind of threat to national security			0
this is the reality of a society regulated by secret justice : a legal system weighted irredeemably in favour of those in power			1
the legislation had previously been watered down considerably , and wisely , by the @entity121			0
now , it is not just as bad as it was when introduced last year			0
under the resuscitated @entity11 , matters involving state security will usually be heard at secret ‘ closed material procedure ’ hearings			1
they will be attended only by security - vetted ‘ special advocates ’			1
those involved in cases against official bodies will be permanently unable to know about the evidence deployed against them			0
the new revised draft , the product of the final session of the @entity24 ’s committee stage , was forced through by a majority of one			0
the @entity66 @entity65 cast the critical vote			1
this took place at precisely the same time as the same - sex marriage debate was happening in the main commons chamber , which is why all this went virtually unnoticed			1
justice : under the new powers information revealed by the recent @entity54 inquiry could have remained concealed by the authorities the consequences are draconian			1
the government ’s actions , prompted by intense lobbying from @entity157 and @entity158 security chiefs , mean there is now less than three weeks to stop the enactment of a ruthless measure that amounts to a charter for cover - ups			1
a real recent example of a case that will be affected is that of @entity166			0
he is the @entity168 opposition leader abducted with his family from @entity170 with the help of @entity18 intelligence , then tortured by @entity174 ’s brutal regime for years			0
like other victims of ‘ extraordinary rendition ’ , mr @entity166 , who has never been alleged to have committed a single hostile act against @entity18 , its citizens or its allies , is suing the @entity181			0
but the official evidence of what was done in our name will be deemed far too ‘ sensitive ’ to be aired in open court			0
once the @entity11 becomes law , his chances of success are remote			1
and the prospects for enforcing the merest whiff of accountability on the agencies responsible for torture cases , and , indeed , a vast range of official activity from national security to the country ’s ‘ economic wellbeing ’ , will be just as distant			0
safeguards : conservative backbencher @entity202 said it was ' appalling ' that the government reneged on its promise to allow full judicial discretion previously , the @entity121 had passed two crucial safeguards to stop this			0
the first said judges could grant the government a secret hearing only if other alternatives had already been considered , like , for example , asking permission from the judge in a case to withhold sensitive evidence altogether , under the longstanding system of ‘ public interest immunity ’			1
the second @entity121 safeguard was more fundamental			0
it stated that judges could allow a secret hearing only after balancing the government ’s demand for one against the historic legal principle that justice must always be open			1
last week , with the passage of @entity228 , moved by the junior justice minister @entity230 , both these safeguards were swept away			0
‘ in practice , it will now be very difficult for a judge to resist a closed hearing , ’ one legal analyst said yesterday			1
under this @entity11 , it is now possible a prisoner in a @entity18 jail who tried to challenge his detention in the courts would remain incarcerated without hearing the evidence against him			1
the battle is not over			0
pending is a @entity246 action by @entity247 which seeks to make public a secret judgment issued in an @entity80 alleged torture case two years ago , which resulted from an earlier form of secret hearing , now deemed illegal by the @entity252			0
as this newspaper has pointed out , the @entity11 will inevitably lead to a body of secret law and secret legal precedents			1
our case also asks the court to issue guidelines on how such secret judgments should be reviewed , and whenever possible , published			0
meanwhile both @entity262 and several influential @entity263 are determined to try to reinstate the @entity121 ’ safeguards when the @entity11 returns to the full @entity30 later this month			1
@entity265 , the leading @entity266 backbencher , said : ‘ it is appalling that the government has reneged on its promise to allow full judicial discretion as enacted by the @entity121			0
’ @entity271 , the @entity263 who campaigned for years against torture and rendition , says : ‘ not only must all of the @entity121 ’ amendments remain in the @entity11 , they need to be underpinned by further improvements			1
’ mr @entity265 added : ‘ what the government did last week is a massive dilution of the protections put in place by the @entity121			2
i can only hope they will summon up the courage to reinstate them			0
’ it is a hope anyone with even the vaguest interest in open justice would surely share .			0

vote on @entity11 took place at same time as gay marriage vote
@entity11 could give power to cover - up details on events such as @entity54
legal system would be weighted in favour of the powerful
