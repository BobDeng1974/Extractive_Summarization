dr @entity46 , an @entity31 consultant at @entity35 's told @entity47 : ' we increase our staffing levels in @entity31 , have more nurses working on the wards , and clear our emergency admission beds in preparation			1

dr @entity76 , president of the @entity77 , warned the summer 's big events would put ' added pressure ' on @entity6 emergency services which are already stretched			2
he said : ' the resilience of the system is being tested on a daily basis			0
the events this summer are added pressure because there will be more people in the country and there will be increased numbers of alcohol cases for departments to deal with			0
' initiatives that safely care for patients suffering from uncomplicated mild intoxication in settings other than the emergency department are helpful			0
' worry : newly appointed @entity98 manager @entity97 may be hoping for a win in @entity17 but the ambulance service are worried about an increase in drunken revellers during the games meanwhile , @entity104 , a senior paramedic with the @entity105 , highlighted @entity17 as a particular cause for concern			2
the late afternoon and evening @entity98 games in @entity109 and @entity110 will make it easy for fans to drink while watching , he added			0
mr @entity104 ' service will be deploying its ' booze bus ' , an ambulance that can ferry up to five intoxicated revellers at a time to a recovery centre in central @entity118			1
the unit opened for christmas 2011 and in february began opening on friday and saturday nights			0
between february and april it treated 259 people			0

' this is a very costly way to manage patients , ' she said			0
' an additional 30 - 40 patients for an @entity31 night shift can mean a department that is coping becomes a department that is overwhelmed			0
the @entity6 ca n't afford a £ 1,000 for every big night			1
