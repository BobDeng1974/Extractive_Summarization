by @entity0 @entity2 does n't have enough money to get its new , $ 12 billion rocket system off the ground by the end of 2017 as planned , federal auditors warned today			1
the @entity7 issued a report wednesday saying @entity10 's @entity9 is at ' high risk of missing ' its planned december 2017 initial test flight			1
the post-space shuttle program would build the biggest rockets ever - larger than the @entity16 rockets which sent men to the moon - to send astronauts to asteroids and @entity21			2
the smaller , 70 - metric - ton @entity9 will stand 321 feet tall , provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff , weigh 5.5 million poundsand carry 154,000 pounds of payload			1
the massive 130 - metric - ton - configuration will be the most capable , powerful launch vehicle in history			0
towering a staggering 384 feet tall , it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds			1
it will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit			2
' they ca n't meet the date with the money they have , ' report author @entity41 said			0
she said it was n't because the space agency had technical problems with the congressionally - required program , but that @entity2 did n't get enough money to carry out the massive undertaking			0
the @entity7 report put the current shortfall at $ 400 million , but did say @entity54 ' making solid progress ' on the rocket program design			2
@entity2 's launch system officials told the @entity7 that there was a 90 percent chance of not hitting the launch date at this time			0
this usually means @entity2 has to delay its test launch date , get more money or be less ambitious about what it plans to do , said former @entity2 associate administrator @entity66 , space policy director at @entity68			2
the biggest rocket ever made : the @entity9 will be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds @entity2 is working on the problems @entity7 highlighted , but delaying launch or diverting money from other programs would harm taxpayers , @entity2 associate administrator @entity70 wrote in the agency 's response			1
' welcome to aerospace , ' @entity66 said , pointing out that large space projects often end up as much as 50 percent over budget			0
he said that ' is why you should n't believe initial cost estimates			0
' the space agency has been reluctant to put an overall price tag on the space launch system			0
the @entity7 report says it will cost $ 12 billion to get to the first test launch and ' potentially billions more to develop increasingly capable vehicles ' that could be used for launches to asteroids and @entity21 .			1

*construction* of the @entity9 has already begun
rocket will be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds
first test flight *scheduled* for 2017
could be used as part of *manned* @entity21 missions
