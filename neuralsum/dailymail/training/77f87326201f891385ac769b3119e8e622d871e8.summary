@entity2 's glamour clash with @entity3 did not turn into the nightmare some had envisaged after news of @entity6 ’ dramatic team selection emerged			1
an intriguing 90 minutes ended , with @entity7 having netted the goal which separated the sides , and the game produced a number of talking points , most notably the performances of the players who @entity6 chose to go with in the @entity15			1
here @entity16 analyses five issues that arose during the @entity19 contest and looks at whether the night has the potential to be a turning point in a campaign that has stuttered and spluttered during the opening months			1
@entity6 made seven changes to the team that started on the weekend against @entity25 @entity7 celebrates scoring the winning goal for @entity3 against @entity2 at the @entity27 @entity28 ( second left ) looks dejected as @entity3 's players congratulate @entity7 after his opener 1 ) @entity31 can not lose his place against @entity33 if there were fears beforehand that @entity31 ’s presence in @entity2 ’s defence would be the catalyst for a @entity3 goal spree , they were soon dispelled			1
the @entity41 has been derided during his time on @entity44 for his tendency to make spectacular mistakes but , here , he did n’t put a foot wrong			0
another big test looms against @entity33 but if @entity6 was to bring @entity51 back , it would be grossly unfair			2
the manager may see @entity51 as a future leader of his defence but the start to his @entity2 career has been underwhelming			2
there is reason to feel he was dropped not rested			0
@entity31 , by contrast , has not done badly when he has been called upon - apart from one aberration when conceding a penalty in the @entity64 defeat of @entity65 - and he dealt with @entity67 et al confidently			1
he deserves the chance now to shackle @entity69			0
@entity31 ( left ) holds off @entity7 in what was an impressive display by the @entity2 defender @entity7 ( right ) hurdles as he is denied by a combination of @entity28 ( on ground ) and @entity31 2 ) @entity28 could have turned the corner pressure has been building on @entity28 and if @entity2 had struck an agreement with @entity79 , who they had been tracking since the summer , he would have faced a major fight to preserve his status as no 1			1
@entity28 ’s performances have been erratic , anxious even , and his failure to command the penalty area , to exude authority , have caused jitters to spread			0
the intensity of the @entity27 could have tipped him over the edge but the @entity90 international responded impressively			2
two fine stops in the first 10 minutes from @entity92 and @entity67 set him up and , for once , he looked ready to go to war with his defenders , barking his displeasure if their concentration dipped			0
the scrutiny will not go away but this display may bolster his fragile confidence			0
@entity100 ( centre ) rises to collect a cross and deny @entity67 an effort at goal the view from behind the goal as @entity28 stretches and acrobatically denies @entity67 ( left ) 3 ) @entity107 is the pick of @entity2 ’s summer spending spree there has been scrutiny on how better off @entity2 are for their heavy transfer expenditure - rightly so - but , with each game , @entity107 is making his £ 12million acquisition look smart business			1
the toing and froing with @entity118 to broker a deal appears worthwhile			0
back in familiar surrounds , the @entity121 under - 21 international was accomplished from first whistle to last , covering miles up and down the left flank			0
he showed discipline to stick to his task defensively but also added weight to @entity2 ’s attack , delivering some fine crosses			2
he has been culpable for some of the goals conceded so far - think @entity25 on saturday and @entity133 on his debut spring to mind - but once @entity2 polish his rough edges , @entity107 will be a gem			1
@entity3 versus @entity2 was an occasion in which he was at home			1
@entity107 has looked good going forward and could prove to be @entity6 ' best summer signing @entity107 ( right ) tackles @entity3 's @entity141 during the match at the @entity27 on tuesday 4 ) @entity143 must be given perspective the radio phone - ins on saturday evening made for illuminating listening			1
vexed by the manner of the loss at @entity25 , a flurry of callers to 606 unleashed their fury on @entity6 and suggested his time at @entity153 was up			0
this , of course , is the way of the modern world			0
@entity6 again found himself under fire for making eight changes in the @entity27 - this observer ’s view is that it was far too many and could have backfired spectacularly			1
he must appreciate why there was such uproar , given the fixture			0
it created the perception this was a distraction			0
high up in the stands , though , @entity2 ’s travelling supporters gave frequent and noisy backing to their manager , reminding him of their affection			2
@entity6 must prove himself this season and show what happened in the last campaign was no fluke but @entity153 ’s masses have faith in his project			0
@entity2 fans who travelled to the @entity27 showed support for @entity6 during the game despite changes @entity6 roars out orders to his depleted side from his technical area at the @entity27 @entity6 stands stony - faced on the touchline at the @entity27 during @entity2 's defeat 5 ) @entity188 ’s status as one of world football ’s top stars is undiminished @entity6 had his reasons for using @entity188 from the bench but the game was poorer without his presence from the first whistle			1
that said , the moment he was summoned to the action produced a marvellous reaction from the home supporters			0
@entity188 , who had spoken warmly about @entity3 before the first @entity19 game , was given a standing ovation when he entered the fray , a sign from @entity27 regulars that they have recognised and appreciated all he has achieved through his career			1
@entity2 plan to open formal contract talks with him soon and @entity6 does not want to lose his captain			2
if , though , for some reason they carelessly allowed him to leave , plenty of top clubs would be ready to take him			0
@entity3 ’s fans showed how well he would be received in @entity121			2
@entity188 ( left ) , @entity215 ( centre ) and @entity217 watch on from the bench in @entity3 @entity188 ( left ) started the game on the bench and came on as a sub for @entity221 the @entity2 captain is still one of the world 's best and will be courted by lots of clubs if he leave @entity226 warranted a result against @entity228 like @entity230 's facebook page .			1
