most parents dream of their children growing up to become doctors , lawyers or astronauts			0
but when @entity5 and @entity6 from @entity7 think of their nine - year - old son @entity8 's future , they see prison			1
the schoolboy , who features in a new programme tonight on @entity13 called my violent child , has suffered from bouts of extreme violence since he was very young - even at the age of four he threatened his older brother , then five , with a knife			1
his father @entity5 said : ' from a very young age he was very aggressive			2
when he was about four , he held a knife to @entity35 and threw bricks at @entity35			0
' he continued : ' we 've had police at the house where he 's thrown brick - a child ended up injured and needing dental treatment			1
' i expect for @entity8 in his teens to be locked up , we 're expecting that			0
because he does n't care			0
' @entity45 after one of his outbursts the couple , who have three other children ; @entity35 , 10 , @entity51 , seven , and @entity52 , four , have been unable to control @entity8 's behaviour for years because they have no idea what the root of the problem is or what will start him off			1
@entity6 said : ' absolutely anything sets @entity8 off , it can be anything as daft as two items of food touching on his plate , a noise , a smell or something he sees - it can be anything			1
' he 's physically abusive , he 's mentally abusive , he really gets to you - to the point that he makes me want to cry sometimes			0
' sometimes i just let him pinch me and hit me and then he 'll calm down and sometimes he does			0
' i do n't want to live on edge every day when he wakes up , i should be able to enjoy being his mum			0
' @entity8 attacks his mother during a tantrum @entity6 and her son @entity35 try to get @entity8 off a bike during one of his outbursts the brunt of @entity8 's behaviour is borne by his parents - @entity5 and @entity6 have both been strangled by their son and during the hour - long programme , he is regularly filmed punching , biting and kicking them both			1
but the violence also extends to his brothers , including four - year - old @entity52 , who is filmed being kicked by @entity8 in the park			0
his nature has become so unpredictable that @entity6 reveals she is worried about leaving them alone in a room			0
@entity6 reveals that she often just allows @entity8 to kick and punch her to calm him down @entity6 said : ' i ca n't leave him with his brothers because i know he 'll hit them			1
' the strain has become so great on @entity6 and @entity5 that it has almost split them up several times			1
@entity5 said : ' it has driven us to the point where we could have parted ways many times			0
' when there 's no more you can do for each other and we 're struggling , it gets to the point where it would be easier to turn and walk away			0
' in an effort to find out what is causing @entity8 's outbursts , the programme makers call in parenting expert @entity114			1
following a discussion with @entity6 , she discovers that the very early years of his life were fraught with stress from the family 's living situation			1
from left : father @entity5 , @entity35 , 10 , @entity8 , nine , @entity51 , seven , @entity52 , four , and @entity6 @entity6 and @entity5 had their eldest child @entity35 when @entity6 was just 14 years old , then 10 months later she gave birth to her second son @entity8			1
because of the strain of having two children so close together , @entity6 reveals that she was very stressed and admits that she did n't bond with @entity8 as well as she would have hoped			2
@entity114 then talks the family through a series of tricks that she can use to enforce the bond between mother and son and explains that much of @entity8 's behaviour may be down to the lack of affection			2
@entity6 attempts a bonding exercise with @entity8 as @entity6 starts to use tactile behaviour , including hugging @entity8 when he is having a tantrum or lightly touching his hand , she sees that her son starts to come out of his tantrums much quicker			2
@entity114 also discusses the importance of @entity5 spending time with his family			2
@entity5 works long hours six days a week in a car business in order to provide for his family , but @entity147 emphasises that his children also need him to be around at home			2
the family then spend a day at the farm together and the couple admit that they are beginning to see big improvements in their son			0
@entity6 said : ' it is early days but i hope that if i persevere with it then we 'll get results down the line and i think that day will come			0
' my violent child airs on @entity13 this wednesday at 9pm			1

@entity5 and @entity6 from @entity7 have four sons aged four to 10
but the couple 's second eldest @entity8 , nine , suffers violent outbursts
he has already been in trouble with police for attacking a child with a brick
the family are *appearing* on @entity13 's show my violent child tonight
