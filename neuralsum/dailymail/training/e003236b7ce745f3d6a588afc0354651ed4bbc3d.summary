by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:57 est , 9 december 2012 updated : 12:17 est , 10 december 2012 @entity3 minister @entity2 said he was willing to travel to @entity4 to see first hand how the ' depenalisation ' of drugs has worked in practice ministers are to examine @entity11 laws to ‘ depenalise ’ drugs after a damning report said the government ’s current strategy is not working			1
@entity3 minister @entity2 said he was ready to visit @entity4 to see first hand how the removal of criminal penalties for people caught with small amounts of drugs could help tackle the problem in the @entity23			1
he insisted the government was ‘ open to new ways of thinking ’ after the @entity25 home affairs select committee asked for a royal commission to examine whether possession of drugs – even heroin and crack – should cease to be a criminal offence			1
the committee said it was ' impressed ' by the @entity11 system and ' alternative strategies should now be considered '			2
mr @entity2 said today : ' there are interesting new ideas			1
the report says we should look more carefully at the model that ’s happened in @entity4			1
' i ’m certainly happy to go to @entity4 as the report recommends and see what they ’re doing there			1
so we should be open to new ideas and fresh thinking but we should also acknowledge that we ’ve made a lot of progress in the last five or ten years			0
' mental health campaigners warned the link between cannabis and mental health should not be ignored			1
but the committee said was clear from other countries that the @entity23 approach was not working , and alternative strategies - such as those developed in @entity4 - should now be considered			1
' we were impressed by what we saw of the @entity4 depenalised system			1
it had clearly reduced public concern about drug use in that country , and was supported by all political parties and the police , ' it said			0
' although it is not certain that the @entity4 experience could be replicated in the @entity23 , given societal differences , we believe this is a model that merits significantly closer consideration			2
' ministers should , it said , open discussions with the @entity75 @entity74 on new ways tackle what it called the ' global drugs dilemma ' - including ' the possibility of legalisation and regulation '			2
legalise it : some say a legalisation of drugs would prevent a black market and benefit @entity23 whilst anti-drugs charities say it will flood the country with drugs however mr @entity2 said so - called legal highs now posed a ' mutating threat ' after an ' explosion ' in their use in recent years			1
' we have a growing problem with the drugs that are legal , so called legal highs and we have a diminishing problem with drugs that are illegal like heroin and crack cocaine			2
so i do n’t think that it automatically follows that making drugs legal reduces harm			0
' mr @entity2 was forced to repeatedly deny the report would be shelved , as a senior @entity110 appeared to back a major shift in drugs law by suggesting legal bans should be replaced by education for users			1
on @entity117 , @entity116 , who is a @entity110 vice-chairman , wrote : ‘ have often said : @entity118 in @entity119 did n’t work			1
created crime & black market			0
@entity120 is right to ask if drug prohibition works			0
‘ if we spent the money on educating people that drugs are dangerous instead of attempting & failing to ban them , i suspect more effective			0
’ the committee ’s conclusions were undermined however by detailed minutes of its meetings that showed three of its five @entity110 members voted against the recommendation to call for a royal commission			1
drug support : @entity110 vice-chairman @entity116 , pictured at a 2008 protest , said money is better spent on education about the dangers of drugs than enforcing bans the panel also split evenly on whether cannabis should be given a lower classification			1
that recommendation was included on the casting vote of the chairman , @entity149 mp @entity148			0
the report sparked fury among drugs campaigners – and ministers immediately ruled out major changes to the law			0
@entity156 , of the charity @entity157 , said : ‘ a royal commission would cost the earth , and we do not need it to tell us what we already know : legalisation would open the floodgates and drug use would increase			0
it will also do nothing to help @entity166			0
’ @entity167 , of @entity168 , a mental health charity , said : ‘ if the report is to be responsible , it must take account of the specific damage that cannabis can do to the developing brain			2
‘ not only because recent studies have shown it inducing irreversible cognitive deterioration but in around 10 per cent of cases triggering severe psychotic illness			0
’ the @entity180 took evidence from comedian and former heroin addict @entity183 , who said drug bans did n’t work , and sir @entity185 who said the sale of drugs should be permitted and taxed			0
they visited @entity166 to see the effects of the drugs trade , and met the country ’s president			0
the report said the @entity180 ‘ recognise and sympathise with the immense suffering and slaying of innocent people which tragically has taken place over the years in @entity166 and other @entity198 countries , as a result of the murderous rivalry between drug gangs			0
’ the mps called for cannabis to be reclassified as a @entity205 drug from @entity205 the report also claims the lack of a ban on cigarettes and alcohol can send a ‘ confusing message ’ to drug users			2
a government spokesman said : ‘ we have no intention of downgrading or declassifying cannabis			2
a royal commission on drugs is simply not necessary			0

home affairs select committee says government strategy is not working
@entity222 minister @entity2 to visit @entity4 to see no - penalty policy
but campaigners warn over link between cannabis and mental illness
and @entity110 vice-chairman suggests legal ban should be replaced by education
