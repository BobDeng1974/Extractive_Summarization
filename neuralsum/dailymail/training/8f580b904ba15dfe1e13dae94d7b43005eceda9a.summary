by @entity0 if you ’ve ever wanted to see a shipwreck up close in real time , now ’s your chance			0
over the next week the @entity5 ( @entity6 ) will be exploring a section of the @entity9 home to a sunken @entity11 u-boat and a @entity13 passenger ship from @entity14			1
and you can watch the vehicle ’s exploration of the area live as it also observes brine pools , lakes and deep - water coral reefs , with the channel staying on - air until 9 october			1
scroll down for more video this mission is just the latest adventure this year for the @entity26 ship and its crew , operated by @entity28 , where users can ask questions directly to the scientists this neutrally buoyant yellow @entity5 ( @entity6 ) is the workhorse of the @entity34			1
it is always used in tandem with another remotely operated vehicle , @entity38			0
@entity5 is equipped with six thrusters that allow the pilots to ‘ fly ’ it in any direction , plus two manipulator arms designed for collecting samples and recovering artifacts			0
video from @entity5 ' high - definition main camera is streamed up a fiber - optic cable to the control van on @entity26 , then out to the world			2
it is capable of operating down to 13,100 feet ( 4,000 metres )			0
it has already performed several successful missions and has more scheduled up to 9 october as part of the 2014 @entity55			2
this particular project is known as ‘ @entity57 ’ , during which it may visit up to four shipwrecks			2
of the shipwrecks that might be visited , one is the @entity63 , which sank with all hands on deck in 1942 from depth charges released by @entity13 patrol vessel @entity67			2
this makes it the only known u-boat to be sunk in the @entity9			1
the sinking of @entity63 followed its own attack on the steam passenger ship @entity74 , which it torpedoed and sent to the bottom of the ocean a few minutes prior			2
of the 270 passengers on the ship , however , 250 of them were saved by @entity67			0
the attack on the passenger ship was a result of @entity11 ’s policy of ‘ unrestricted submarine warfare ’ in @entity14 , which saw them target ships of any sort			1
the wrecks of the two vessels are just a few miles apart in the @entity9			1
wrecks for exploration include the @entity93 sank and the steam passenger ship @entity74 , both of which sunk in 1942			1
other potential sites for exploration include two oil tankers that were also sunk in @entity14 by @entity11 u-boats , the @entity101 and @entity100 the @entity5 remotely operated vehicle is preparing to explore the @entity9 over the next week including several shipwrecks , one being the @entity104 ( gun shown )			1
this sank with all hands on deck in 1942 from depth charges released by @entity13 patrol vessel pc - 566 @entity5 is a neutrally buoyant yellow remotely operated vehicle ( @entity6 ) and is the workhorse of the @entity34			2
it is always used in tandem with another remotely operated vehicle , @entity38 , and is equipped with six thrusters that allow the pilots to ¿ fly ¿ it in any direction other potential sites for exploration by the @entity5 include two oil tankers that were also sunk by @entity11 u-boats in @entity14 , the @entity101 and @entity100			1
these tankers are particularly interesting because they have a high number of large corals growing on them			0
the mission will be run from the @entity129 ’s flagship vessel , @entity26			0
it is one of only two dedicated ships of exploration in the world			1
the 211 - foot ( 64 metres ) ship is equipped with all of the latest in ocean technology and can host a 31 person science team in addition to 17 crew members			0
the ship is outfitted for a two - tiered approach to exploration			1
first the team uses a multibeam sonar system to map unknown areas of the seafloor			0
once the data is analyzed and targets are chosen , they use remotely operated vehicles to collect video footage and a variety of samples			0
up to the end of 2014 the ship and its crew will continue to explore locations in the @entity9 and surrounding waters			1
the mission will be run from the @entity129 's flagship vessel , @entity26 ( pictured )			0
it is a ship dedicated to exploration and measures 211 feet ( 64 metres ) long			0
it is equipped with all of the latest in ocean technology and can host a 31 person science team in addition to 17 crew members			0

*researchers* are exploring shipwrecks at the bottom of the @entity9
the scientists are streaming live footage from the event over the next week
exploration is being performed by the @entity177
there are four ships that might be observed , all sunk in @entity14
one is a @entity11 u-boat , the only u-boat ever sunk in the @entity9
this mission is called ' exploring the @entity186 ' and lasts 7 - 14 july
