@entity13 was found dead yesterday the news came as princess @entity5 , 67 , went ahead with a pre-planned trip to @entity30 yesterday			1
accompanying the @entity40 , and other @entity41 , she said she was ' very distressed ' by the death of her friend - who she was pictured holding hands with during a holiday in @entity34			1
@entity13 reportedly told a @entity4 magazine , in the days before his death , how difficult it was to run a small or medium sized business in the country			1
he said : ' in @entity4 it is all a business can do to survive - with the exception of those closely linked to the state			1
loans are expensive , money is expensive , so furniture retailers do not develop			2
' @entity58 , managing director of @entity59 , said his acquaintance was ' under pressure ' following the raid			2
he said : ' @entity63 was pressed hard , but he did not give up			2
now we can most likely expect the seizure of the factory , and then after another two to three resales it will pass into the hands of the real buyer			2
' princess @entity5 with @entity4 millionaire @entity13 were alleged to have shared a suite at the @entity73 , one of @entity34 's most glamorous hotels the pair were pictured enjoying a day out together in a gondola during their stay in @entity34			1
both denied an affair was taking place police say the tycoon , who built his business empire around his £ 130million - a - year march 8 furniture brand , was hauled from his car and shot up to ten times			1
two ‘ professional ’ gunmen who knew his whereabouts carried out the killing , and there has been a suggestion there was a mystery passenger with mr @entity13 in his car who later vanished			1
an unnamed source also claimed that before his death mr @entity13 had ‘ branched out into @entity4 ’s real estate and construction markets ’ , both of which are ‘ notoriously corrupt ’ , as the furniture market slowed down			1
the source said : ‘ we can not rule out the common scenario for such shootings – a debt he could n’t repay or a dispute over ownership of a company or property			1
@entity111 , spokesman for princess @entity5 who was linked to the tycoon following intense scrutiny six years ago , said : ‘ @entity114 and princess @entity5 are very distressed to hear of this tragedy			1
’ the princess – nicknamed ‘ @entity117 ’ because of her over-confident manner – has always denied having an affair with mr @entity13 , 21 years her junior			1
the two royals and the @entity4 tycoon together			2
princess @entity5 has strongly denied claims of an affair , but said she and @entity13 are good friends @entity4 look : the @entity114 in front of @entity129 and the glamorous princess of @entity131 attending a charity dinner			1
both have strong links with @entity4 but in 2006 the two were pictured holding hands and staring lovingly into each other 's eyes while enjoying a stroll and a gondola ride in @entity34			2
the princess was also reported to have booked a suite at one of @entity34 ’s most expensive hotels for herself under the assumed name of ‘ @entity146 ’			2
at the time , princess @entity5 ’s spokesman mr @entity111 said the pair – who had met at an interior design exhibition the previous year – had simply forged a friendship after mr @entity13 confided in her about the death of his wife and daughter in a car crash in 2001			1
‘ she has been seeking to be supportive , ’ mr @entity111 said			0
‘ it ’s not an affair			0
’ and later , the princess herself spoke out to deny the claims			2
she told @entity163 : ‘ the true nature of our relationship is that it is a very good friendship			0
‘ i hold hands with all my friends			0
i do n’t think that ’s being intimate at all			0
i ’m a very tactile person – i do it all the time			0
’ later , mr @entity13 also denied claims of an affair , saying : ‘ we ( the princess and @entity175 ) have just normal human relations			1
’ @entity18 has been awash with rumours surrounding the death of the tycoon , who was regarded as one of @entity18 ’s most eligible bachelors			1
battle : @entity183 appearing at the high court in @entity185 for his dispute with @entity187 he was made a widower in 2001 following the death of his wife and their seven - year - old daughter in a car accident			2
police said he had been driving only yards from a luxury house he built for his parents at around 2am when he was overtaken and the road blocked			0
he was then shot five times in the body before being dragged from his car and shot in the head			2
some accounts suggested a total of ten shots had been fired			0
shocked friends insisted he had had no enemies			0
unusually for a wealthy @entity4 businessman , he was often seen without bodyguards and was described by friends as one of the most ‘ modest and unassuming ’ of @entity4 ’s super-rich			0
friends insisted that his dozen or so businesses in furniture , construction and real estate were all solvent and that despite his vast wealth he had never bothered to hire bodyguards because he had no fears for his safety			0
one , his aide @entity223 , said the news had come ‘ like a blow of thunder from a clear sky ’			0
miss @entity223 said everything had been ‘ normal ’ when she last saw the businessman on friday at a furniture exhibition			0
‘ there was absolutely no sign of problems , or tension , no cars following him , no threats – nothing at all indicating that his life could have possibly been in danger , ’ she said			0
‘ he would have never even bothered with bodyguards , he felt no need to use them			0
he felt no threat at all			0
for us , as for the inner circle of people who worked closely with him , it was an absolute shock to hear			0
’ prince @entity5 was in @entity4 last week without the princess			1
he flew to @entity252 to be awarded with a degree by a @entity4 university for services to @entity257 - @entity4 relations			2
but his trip was overshadowed by revelations that he had accepted £ 320,000 in secret payments from @entity4 oligarch @entity183 , a leading foe of president @entity262			0
the payments via an offshore company from mr @entity183 , who is exiled in @entity185 , were disclosed in court documents			0
the oligarch ’s spokesman said : ‘ mr @entity183 has known the prince since the early 1990s and has a high regard for the prince ’s work			0
he therefore chose to be supportive over a period which ended some years ago			0
