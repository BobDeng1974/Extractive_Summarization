the @entity0 do n’t actually care much for music , ’ said sir @entity2 , the great 20th - century conductor and noted wit , ‘ but they love the sound it makes ! ’ this week the sound that has filled our concert halls and all the spaces where music - lovers gather has been of loud cheering			1
when it was announced on tuesday that sir @entity16 will be coming home from @entity18 in 2017 to run the @entity19 , whoops of delight could be heard all the way from @entity22 ’s @entity21 , where the @entity19 play , to @entity24 , @entity25 , the middle - class suburb of @entity27 where @entity16 was born 60 years ago			1
the most remarkable @entity0 classical musician since the celebrated @entity2 , @entity16 has scaled the highest peaks			1
appointed cbe at the ripe old age of 32 , he was knighted seven years later , and elected principal conductor of the @entity33 , the world ’s most formidable orchestra , at 44			1
conductor sir @entity16 is to join @entity19 as music director in an age of overpaid footballers and gruesome shows like @entity39 , an age when the mediocre wear garlands tossed by dullards , here is a man who has truly earned his laurel crown			1
when he received the weighty badge of the @entity53 last summer ( ‘ do n’t try conducting with this thing on ! ’ the @entity46 told him at the investiture ) it was formal recognition that he belonged to the @entity50			0
now the man who conquered the world is coming home to join our leading orchestra and , what ’s more , he sees his role not just as a conductor but as an ambassador , an educator , whose duty is to boost musical talent wherever he can			1
‘ frankly , ’ he says , ‘ what goes on in the primary school is going to be just as important as what goes on in any concert hall			0
’ knowing @entity16 as i do , this was no throw - away remark			1
talk of greatness is usually misplaced			0
there are never many truly great performers in any field			0
so when they do come along it is our duty to recognise the special gifts that lift them above the pack			0
we could call it the @entity83 distinction			0
@entity83 is a great tennis player , perhaps the greatest ; @entity84 is merely very good			0
in the performing arts it can be difficult to describe what greatness looks like because , unlike in sport , there are no clear winners and losers			0
over time , however , you have a sense of those who achieve it			0
@entity98 , for instance , was a great actor			0
@entity99 was a great dancer			0
@entity100 was a great singer			0
and sir @entity16 is unquestionably a great musician			1
born on the same road in @entity27 as @entity102 , @entity16 was at primary school when @entity104 took off like a rocket			1
no magical mystery tours for him , though			0
the @entity107 , as he is known , was a bookish child , who played the piano and was later a percussionist in the @entity112			0
‘ i tried to interest him in cricket and football ’ , said his father @entity116 , ‘ but he always seemed to have his head in a music score			2
’ sir @entity16 ( right ) , whose youngest child with @entity123 mezzo - soprano @entity122 ( left ) , 41 , is seven months old , has directed the @entity33 since 2002 @entity124 , originally from @entity125 , was a businessman who taught @entity0 in his retirement			1
at @entity129 , where he knew sir @entity128 , he had played in a jazz band , so he did nothing to discourage his son ’s enthusiasm for music			1
when @entity116 and @entity136 took their son to see the comedian @entity138 at the @entity139 , the five - year - old stopped the show			1
so many members of the audience were amused by the sight of a curious little boy leaving his seat to peer into the orchestra pit that @entity138 had to tell him : ‘ come on , lad			2
i ’ve got a show to do ! ’ the young @entity16 never set foot in @entity27 ’s football ground @entity150 or @entity153 ’s @entity152 as his father might have wished but he was a regular at the city ’s wonderful @entity155 where , in 1966 , his life changed for ever			1
@entity159 ’s mighty @entity158 , the @entity160 , despite its challenging discords , made him realise even then , aged 11 , that he wanted to be a conductor			2
and now he was determined to learn how			0
he studied music scores his sister brought home from the library ; he pored over composers ’ writings on orchestration			2
he would write down the percussion parts of big orchestral pieces , gather friends and family , and hand out those parts so he could conduct his impromptu orchestra while a record of the music played in the background			1
when he was 15 , he cajoled enough musicians together to form a proper orchestra and stage a charity event at @entity27 ’s @entity183			1
it was a resounding success			0
@entity16 ’s days as conductor of the @entity186 are the stuff of legend			1
when he went there aged 25 in 1980 he was , musically speaking , barely out of short pants and the orchestra was at best lacklustre			2
when he left 18 years later as a knight of the realm , the @entity186 was acclaimed as one of the world ’s finest orchestras , and had a magnificent new home			0
@entity198 , which opened in june 1991 as a result of @entity16 ’s persistence and enlightened cross-party political co-operation , remains the best concert hall in @entity203			1
so when people talk about the cultural development of @entity206 , and @entity16 ’s substantial part in it , they are not fibbing			1
the question is : what can he do for @entity22 and @entity203 ? the signs are promising			0
there is a clear will to build a concert hall worthy of @entity22 ’s unrivalled reputation as a city of culture and @entity16 knows , for he is no fool , that his appointment can only assist the process			1
in the @entity186 they are no fools either			0
everybody understands that , with @entity16 at the helm of such a fine orchestra , the @entity19 could become world - beaters not only in public performances but also in the world of music education			1
@entity16 sees his role not just as a conductor but as an ambassador , an educator , whose duty is to boost musical talent wherever he can @entity16 once described how moving it was to bring deaf children into rehearsals in @entity206 , and see how they responded through vibration alone to the experience of a @entity238 symphony			1
in @entity239 he wasted no time in working with children from the city ’s less well - off backgrounds , involving them in dance collaborations with the @entity33			2
some musicians , brought up in the old school , were sceptical but not for long			0
‘ what @entity16 wants ’ , musicians used to say , ‘ @entity16 gets ’			1
which is why his return to @entity22 is so thrilling , and so important			0
in a world of show - offs and halfwits , here is a man with the faith and willpower to move mountains : not on his own behalf but for an art form itself			2
he believes that great music can transform lives			2
describing @entity264 , the great @entity265 conductor and educator , who wrote @entity267 in his spare time , a musician once said : ‘ @entity269 reminds you why you wanted to become a musician in the first place			1
’ that is @entity16 ’s talent too but how he achieves it is hard to pin down			1
it is the conductor who makes all the difference as to whether a performance sinks or swims			2
what you see as he steps on to the podium , is the tip of a vast iceberg of activity involving planning , preparing , rehearsing , managing schedules and endless background work to understand the music			2
this is what helps make @entity16 one of the world ’s greatest , says his biographer sir @entity295 : ‘ he is a meticulous planner , has a fantastic insight for the right combination of pieces in a concert programme and is a brilliant pacer and galvaniser of rehearsals , knowing exactly what he has to achieve and motivating his players accordingly			1
’ but it still fails to explain his achievements			0
when his performances take off , musicians and audiences alike would rather be nowhere else			0
it is n’t so much a matter of his technique with the conductor ’s baton , or bringing in the trombones when they ’re feeling left out as something undefinable			2
in 1999 , a critic memorably described him on the podium : ‘ sometimes he bent to his knees , puffed his cheeks and mimed a straw - chewing yokel to encourage a proportionate rustic attitude in his players			2
that was especially during @entity327 ... during the pizzicato interlude in @entity160 , he dropped his hands to his sides and encouraged his band just to pluck ’ n ’ swing			0
’ what audiences see in @entity16 is a man who feels that , for as long as he is conducting it , that piece is the most important thing in the world			1
musicians , hardly sentimental , are happy to follow him because every concert is an adventure			0
as @entity16 says : ‘ always the journey , never the destination ’			1
his genius , as it always will be with the greats , is that he possesses an alignment of mind and heart that can not be taught			0
‘ @entity16 can achieve things in a performance , ’ a @entity239 musician said last week , ‘ that can never be learnt			2
’ now he is coming home for what he calls ‘ one last challenge ’			0
to which we can only cry : ‘ hurrah ! ’			0
