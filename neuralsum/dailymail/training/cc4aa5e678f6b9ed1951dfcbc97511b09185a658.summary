when it comes to the cinema sensation @entity3 , it appears that most of us fall into one of two camps – those who have seen it , and those who are about to see it			1
the thriller , which topped the @entity12 film charts , taking £ 4.1million in its opening weekend , is the story of an unhappily married woman who goes missing – leaving her husband accused of murder			2
at its heart is @entity20 beauty @entity18 , 35 , who plays @entity21 , the wife of @entity22 , portrayed by @entity24 star @entity23 , 41			1
the actress , who is expecting her second child with partner @entity36 , said we demand too much of our spouses nowadays , telling @entity39 : ' people have ridiculous expectations of a mate			1
' in my grandmother 's day , you would n't expect your husband to fulfil the same need in you as your sister , or girlfriends , or colleagues at work			2
you 'd have different needs met by different people			2
' now we want all our needs met by one person , and i do n't believe that 's possible			1
or rather , it is , but i do n't think it 's universally achievable			2
@entity20 beauty plays @entity21 , the wife of @entity22 , portrayed by @entity24 star @entity23 , 41 , in @entity3 ' i do think separation is key to a relationship			1
i go out with my partner and we are put next to each other – there 's a feeling of , ' what , you do n't think we ca n't operate without each other ? ' i do n't need him as a crutch			1
of course , he 's the person i want to go home with but he 's not necessarily the person i want to sit next to			1
i 'd rather meet someone new , and he would too			0
' the success of the film – directed by @entity73 – puts it on course to become one of the biggest earners this year , and has catapulted @entity29 to global fame			2
on monday , it was one of the most talked - about topics on @entity82			0
speaking of the difficulty of rehearsing sex scenes with on - screen lover @entity86 , 41 , she told @entity88 magazine : ' it was very funny			0
@entity73 left @entity86 and me alone for two hours to make sure we could do it			0
but when it 's just two of you on a bed , it feels so inappropriate			0
' prior to meeting @entity96 , @entity18 was engaged to @entity98 director @entity97 , but they split in 2008 when he called off their wedding plans			1
in an interview soon after , she said : ' i still have no idea why @entity97 called off the wedding			0
he was never clear about it			0
part of what makes it so confusing			0
' i still think he 's an extraordinary man , i really do			0
