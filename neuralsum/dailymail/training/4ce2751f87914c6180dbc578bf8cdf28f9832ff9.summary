by @entity0 @entity1 took a hat - trick in @entity4 's second test against @entity5 - but he did n't even know it ! the 27 - year - old bowler began with the wicket of @entity8 and then sent @entity9 and tailender @entity10 packing with first two balls of the next over			1
stunned : @entity1 discovers he has taken a hat - trick after dismissing @entity14 ha - trick hero : @entity1 celebrates with captain @entity16 after learning of his trble agony and ecstacy : @entity8 swings his bat in frustration after being sent packing by @entity1 however , @entity1 , his team - mates and the crowd , were unaware of his treble due to the change of ends			1
' i was listening to the guy that came on the tannoy there and i was thinking " why is he mentioning the last ball of the over before ? " , and it clicked that that might be a hat - trick ' he told @entity37 sports			2
he became the 13th @entity38 to take a hat - trick and only the fourth player to do so twice			1
@entity42 's five - wicket haul had put @entity4 in the driving seat as @entity16 's side went on to dismiss @entity5 for 257 runs at @entity46			1
@entity1 added : ' it was an excellent bowling performance all round , @entity42 's got the five wickets and @entity50 ( @entity49 , two for 49 ) tied an end up really well			1
' there 's always pressure when you win the toss and bowl , you sort of think it should be 200 all out , but we 're pleased with 270 and to get off 15 overs early			2
' we had an awkward hour or so there and i think that @entity8 wicket was the big one			2
