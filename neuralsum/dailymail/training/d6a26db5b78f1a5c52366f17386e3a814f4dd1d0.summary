as far as dream jobs go manhandling a 400kg alligator called @entity2 would n’t be one of them , but for keepers at the @entity7 it ’s just another day at the office			1
on wednesday keepers at the park in @entity11 on the @entity12 successfully removed a rogue @entity14 alligator from its lagoon of 30 with as little of fuss as possible			1
@entity17 , @entity18 , led the operation , and it was n’t a job for the fainthearted as @entity2 had been playing up for weeks			2
he ’s causing lots of trouble ; biting our boat , chasing us around while we ’re nest raiding and causing many injuries among the alligators , ’ he said			1
‘ it was critical we caught him and moved him to a time out pen			0
’ so just how do you move an almost 400kg alligator ? with great difficulty as it turned out			0
but mr @entity18 and his team had been through this before and took it all in their stride			2
how 's that for a poke in the eye ? @entity7 keepers use a pole to keep @entity2 at bay say cheese ! @entity2 is successfully roped by the keepers after being lured out of his lagoon with food one , two , three , heave ! after roping @entity2 , keepers drag him from the lagoon so that he can be restrained ‘ it takes eight very experienced keepers			2
he was lured from the lagoon with food , roped , restrained and then tied to a board so he could be walked 500 metres to his isolation enclosure , ’ mr @entity18 said			1
‘ the exercise went to plan			0
@entity2 will remain in isolation until autumn			0
alligators are less active as the weather becomes cooler , so when it does , we ’ll reintroduce him into the lagoon			0
’ after being tied to a board , @entity2 is carried 500 metres by keepers to his isolation enclosure now that was n't too bad was it ? mr @entity18 checks @entity2 to see that he is ok before releasing him into the isolation enclosure there are a variety of reptiles , including snakes , lizards , alligators and crocodiles at the park , as well as other @entity7 animals , such as kangaroos , cassowaries and @entity98 devils			1
the park is also heavily involved in snake and spider venom collection for use in the production of @entity103 and is credited for saving thousands of lives .			0

rogue @entity14 alligator , @entity2 , is removed from his lagoon after *consistently* making a *nuisance* of himself
@entity2 bit keepers ' boats , chased them around , and caused many injuries among the alligators he was with
‘ he is a younger male , full of testosterone . he ’s causing lots of trouble , ' says @entity118 , @entity18
@entity2 was eventually restrained , tied to a board , and carried 500 metres by keepers to his new home to cool off
