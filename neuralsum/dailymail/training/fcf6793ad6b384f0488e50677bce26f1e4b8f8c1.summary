@entity2 , 55 , whose father was a postmaster , was a well - respected member of the community but turned to fraud when money worries hit in january 2010			1
she struggled to pay her daily bills and rather than lay staff off or admit the business was struggling she began to generate false cash credits and pocketed more than £ 100,000			1
she covered her tracks by sharing the debt she created out between a number of the branch 's outreach services			2
a court heard that she even kept her crime secret from her husband because she wanted to protect his reputation			1
but her scam was foiled when a routine audit found £ 113,872 missing from the accounts			1
@entity32 , who ran the post office in @entity5 , @entity6 , admitted fraud and was jailed for 16 months at @entity35			1
judge @entity36 told her she had committed a ' significant breach of trust '			2
he said : ' many in the community speak well of you and your family , who support you through this			2
' it 's such a large sum , over a long period of time , it 's too serious not to mark it with a custodial sentence			2
' @entity49 , mitigating , said : ' she 's been employed by the @entity51 all her working life , and her father before her			0
' she 's previously run post offices in various locations in an exemplary fashion			0
' @entity58 needed building up when she and her husband first moved there and she started an outreach branch , going to villages so those who had lost their post offices would have some service			1

fraud : the post office in @entity5 got into financial difficulties in 2010 and the respected boss @entity2 turned to crime to cover their losses guilty plea : @entity32 and her husband have sold their home to pay back the money which was taken ' extremely difficult circumstances arose and over a three - year period , the money went purely on living expenses and making sure the premises could stay open			1
' she did n't want to lay off any staff and she was working more than 60 hours a week			0
' they did n't have a lavish lifestyle and had n't been taking holidays or buying cars beyond their means			0
' she knew from the outset she would be found out and it was a weight off her shoulders			0
' the mangers , who ran the post office together for six years , have now been forced to sell their £ 150,000 home to pay back the stolen money			0
a @entity51 spokesman said : ' we believe that all sub-postmasters hold a unique position of trust			0
' the overwhelming majority of people who work in our branch network are professional , honest and provide the highest standards of service possible and so it is always disappointing when that trust is breached			0
