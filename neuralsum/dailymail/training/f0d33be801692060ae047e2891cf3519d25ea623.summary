by @entity0 published : 10:51 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 11:22 est , 16 july 2013 the families of dozens of dead children whose names were stolen for use in undercover missions will never be told , police revealed yesterday			1
the ‘ @entity12 ’ deception was branded ‘ morally repugnant ’ by one chief constable who said @entity8 hijacked the identities of up to 61 children			1
in a disturbing twist , the review revealed that a secret 2002 inquiry discovered 1,200 passport applications for dead children had been made			1
revelations : the review said that the use of dead children 's identities was common practice among police forces and security agencies the high number could mean that criminals , as well as police and spy agencies , were also using the tactic to forge new lives			1
chief constable @entity30 apologised to families who have complained but said they would never know for certain if their children 's identities were used @entity30 apologised to grieving relatives but said they can never know for certain because of the risk to the lives of former spies if they are ‘ outed ’			1
the @entity39 chief constable admitted the controversial practice was probably far more widespread and was sanctioned at the ‘ highest level ’			1
unveiling his report into the scandal , mr @entity30 said it was commonplace among highly secretive police units for at least 35 years			2
he said : ‘ the people working from 1968 onwards were doing so in a very different environment and times			0
‘ they made the operational decision to use this tactic because it was necessary to protect their operatives			2
‘ some of those deployments were at the top end and extremely sensitive			0
undercover officers in the @entity57 have been subjected to serious harm and beatings			2
‘ overseas , officers from other agencies have been murdered			2
if they are going to go into groups of this calibre you have got to give them the backstop of cover			0
‘ it is not some kind of salacious and immoral use of identities - it was seen at the time as operationally necessary and justified			0
’ revelations that police stole the identities of dead children to help them infiltrate criminal gangs and protest groups provoked outrage two years ago			1
a way in : dead children 's identities were used by undercover offices to infiltrate violent gangs and demonstration groups @entity8 announced an independent review would take place to examine the scale of the tactic and whether it was unlawful			1
it discovered that the names of at least 42 children who died between the ages of four and eight were stolen up until 2003			2
the provenance of a further 19 identities remains under investigation and the total figure is likely to be far higher as the tactic was also used by other forces and spy agencies			0
between 1968 and 2008 a total of 106 false identities were created , of which 45 were entirely fictitious			0
police now use different methods to create fake personas			2
the report examined tactics by members of the @entity106 ( @entity106 ) and the @entity107 ( @entity107 )			0
the @entity106 was created in 1968 in response to violent protests against the @entity110 and went on to investigate animal rights protesters and other extremist groups			0
mr @entity30 said hand - picked officers developed their own tactics , recording their best ideas in an informal book known as the ‘ @entity117 ’			0
he said their work was conducted amid conditions of ‘ extreme secrecy ’ and was given the green light at the ‘ highest levels ’ of government and policing			0
apology : metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity126 said sorry for the ' shock and offence ' caused the units were directly funded by the @entity130 because of thirst for intelligence among top politicians about the activities of dissident groups			1
speaking about his experience , one former head of @entity139 said : ‘ it was for queen and country and peace and democracy			0
it was the way it was done			0
’ police were inspired by the film , @entity148 families who suspected their children ’s names may have been used by police reacted with anger to the police decision to keep their activities secret			1
lawyer @entity158 , who represents @entity159 who fears her son @entity161 ’s name was used , said she feels her concerns have been ‘ swept under the carpet ’			0
he said : ‘ what we heard was not an apology but a pr exercise			0
the families of the dead children whose identities have been stolen by the undercover officers deserve better than this			1
‘ they deserve an explanation , a personal apology and , if appropriate , a warning of the potential risk they face , in the exceptional circumstances , that their dead child ’s identity was used to infiltrate serious criminal organisations			1
’ mrs @entity159 and a further 14 families who suspected the identities of their children may have been used will receive personal apologies from the @entity188			1
the first use of a dead child ’s identity in a spy operation was in 1943 when a corpse carrying false documents was planted off the coast of @entity195 to dupe @entity197 forces			0
in 1971 it was popularised by thriller author @entity199 as it became an accepted practice for undercover officers who chose their own new names from official records			2
a wider multi-million pound inquiry into a host of allegations against undercover officers may not report for another two years			2
a series of former @entity210 , @entity188 commissioners and top civil servants face being questioned amid claims some officers fathered children with their targets			1
officials are also investigating claims the family of murdered teenager @entity220 were smeared by police and allegations undercover officers lied on oath			1
met commissioner sir @entity126 apologised for the ‘ shock and offence ’ caused by the ‘ @entity148 ’ tactic			1
he said : ‘ i believe the public do understand the necessity for police and others to do things like this to protect against a much greater harm			0
‘ it was never intended or foreseen that any of the identities used would become public , or that any family would suffer hurt as a result			0

@entity188 police *confirm* they will not reveal names of dead children used
report claims it could *endanger* officers and upset *elderly* relatives
commission sir @entity126 said force ' not prepared to breach policy '
lawyer for potential victim says families ' deserve better '
review by @entity39 chief constable @entity255 reveals new evidence
1,200 passport applications for dead children were made
