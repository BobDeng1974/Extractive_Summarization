by @entity0 published : 05:01 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 07:54 est , 12 february 2013 a newborn baby 's life has been saved after doctors ' froze ' his body for four whole days			1
@entity5 was born with just a five per cent chance of survival due to a condition that caused his rate to race twice as fast as normal			1
but he has made an amazing recovery after doctors rapidly cooled down his little body			1
claire with her son @entity13 : he was on the brink of death are his heart started racing at over 300 beats per minute doctors cooled @entity13 's body from @entity21 to 33.3c when @entity13 was born in august last year , he was diagnosed with a condition called @entity23			1
it caused his heart to race at over 300 beats per minute - compared to the usual 160 bpm			1
this reduced blood flow to his vital organs and left @entity13 on the brink of death			1
then medics suggested they wrap @entity13 in a blanket filled with a cold gel and allow his temperature to drop from @entity34 to @entity35			1
his mother , @entity36 , 29 , said : ' it was horrible to see him lying there freezing in nothing but a nappy			2
' he was heavily sedated so did n't move much , and he was cold to touch - it looked like he was dead			1
' all i wanted to do was scoop him up and give him a warm cuddle			0
i just had to keep reminding myself that it was saving his life			0
' the doctors at @entity48 cooled @entity13 for two days straight , allowing him to be brought up to a normal temperature when his heart beat slowed			1
but when his heart began to race once more , doctors again had to cool the little boy down for two further days			1
' it was even worse the second time , ' said mrs @entity36			0
' i thought he was out of the woods but then his heart went into a bad rhythm again			1
i remember asking the nurse if he was going to die and she told me that he might			0
' we just had to live minute by minute ; we could n't look ahead because we did n't know what the future held			1
' @entity13 's body was twice cooled over two days out of the woods : although @entity13 could have further heart - racing episodes they are likely to be harmless mrs @entity36 first became suspicious that something was wrong when she was 35 weeks pregnant			1
' i had one of those things where you could listen to your baby 's heartbeat			1
i did it one evening and noticed that his heart was beating really fast			1
@entity23 ( @entity23 ) is a heart condition featuring episodes of an abnormally fast heart rate			1
it often emerges during childhood			0
the heart will suddenly start racing , then stop or slow down abruptly			2
episodes can last from seconds to days in rare cases			0
they may occur regularly , several times a day , or infrequently , once or twice a year			0
the heart rate may be as high as 250 beats per minute , but is usually between 140 and 180 ( a normal adult heartbeat should be 60 - 100 beats per minute at rest )			2
it 's caused by abnormal electrical impulses that start suddenly in the upper chambers of the heart , upsetting the organ 's natural rhythm			1
it causes the heart muscle to contract so fast that it ca n't relax between contractions			1
this reduces the amount of blood being pumped around the body , which can cause dizziness and shortness of breath			2
episodes often happen for no obvious reason			0
however , they may be triggered by a change in posture , exertion , emotional upset , coffee or alcohol			0
in the vast majority of cases , attacks of @entity23 are harmless , do not last long and settle on their own without treatment			0
source : @entity122 ' i 'm a nurse , so i knew it was n't right , but i thought maybe the machine had been wrong , so i went for a lie down for a bit and then tried again			2
' it was normal the next time but i was still worried , so i called the @entity129			0
' i was being scanned and all of a sudden the sonographer went off and came back with lots of senior members of staff			0
' before i knew where i was they 'd told me that my baby was really poorly , and that i should ring my husband because they needed to deliver straight away			0
' they told me there was a very high chance that he 'd die			0
all i could think of was how i was going to tell my other children , @entity144 and @entity145 - they 'd been so excited to have a baby brother			0
' the doctors were all ready to give me a caesarean section when at the last minute they 'd been told by doctors at @entity151 to give me a medication that could slow the baby 's heart beat			1
' mrs @entity36 was on the medication for two days before being referred to @entity151			0
' when we got to @entity151 i went for another scan and then they took us into a room to explain what was going on			0
' as soon as my husband @entity161 and i walked into the room we saw a box of tissues on a side table			0
we knew then it was n't going to be good news			2
' doctors explained to the couple that the cause of @entity13 's @entity23 was unknown , and the best thing to do would be to deliver and treat him directly			1
mrs @entity36 was transferred to @entity48 where @entity13 was delivered			0
' it was three hours before i got to see him and he was hooked up to so many machines			2
it was just awful , ' she said			0
' then later that night doctors came up to tell me that he was in a really bad way , and all they could do was try and shock his heart , and then cool him down			1
' welcome home : @entity13 with parents @entity0 and @entity161 and siblings @entity181 and @entity145 in @entity182 @entity0 , who is a nurse , realised something was wrong after measuring her baby 's heart rate in the womb doctors decided to cool @entity13 in order to slow his heart rate down and ensure his organs would not be deprived of oxygen			1
in total @entity13 spent four days wrapped in a blanket that lowered his body temperature , whilst also being shocked five times with a defibrillator , which is an electric current directed into his heart			1
it was on the evening of the fourth day of cooling that @entity13 's heart rate finally returned to normal			1
' i could n't believe it , i was absolutely overjoyed ' said mrs @entity36			2
' i wanted to be cautious , because i was aware that he could go into an abnormal rhythm again , but it was amazing			0
' medics then began to warm @entity13 's body by half a degree every 12 hours , and the youngster slowly began to improve			1
' as soon as his heart started beating normally everything began to improve			2
he 'd been really puffy because his kidneys were n't working , but all of a sudden he looked like a normal baby again			2
' a month later , after being referred back to the @entity129 , @entity13 was finally allowed to return home to his family			0
' when i walked through my front door with @entity13 in his arms , it felt like a dream come true			0
' there had been so many times when we thought he 'd never come home			0
it 's just been wonderful			2
' six - month - old @entity13 is now a healthy and happy baby , back at home with his family			0
@entity23 is caused by abnormal electrical impulses that start suddenly in the upper chambers of the heart			2
they may be triggered by exertion or stress			0
although it is possible @entity13 may have further heart - racing episodes , they will most likely be harmless and not last long .			2

blood was n't flowing *efficiently* to @entity5 's organs
doctors shocked his heart with a defibrillator and wrapped him in a blanket filled with cold gel
medics warmed his bod by half a degree every 12 hours
