a new vaccine to stimulate the body 's immune system could offer a cure for @entity4			1
the ' kick and kill ' strategy aims to eradicate the virus , by stimulating the immune system - the body 's natural defence mechanism - with a vaccine			1
researchers believe the injection could flush out dormant @entity4 hiding in white blood cells with a chemical ' kick ' , allowing a boosted immune system to identify and kill the cells			1
the theory , developed by researchers at @entity22 , the @entity23 and the @entity24 , is based on a single patient case study			1
scientists hope a new ' kick and kill ' vaccine could flush out @entity4 hidden in the body before stimulating a person 's own immune system to kill the cells ' our study shows that the immune system can be as powerful as the most potent combination drug cocktails , ' study co-author dr @entity33 , of @entity22 , said			1
' we 're still a long way from being able to cure @entity4 patients , as we still need to develop and test effective vaccines , but this study takes us one step closer by showing us what type of immune responses an effective vaccine should induce			2
' the study looked at a single 59 - year - old man in @entity47 who was an ' elite controller ' - meaning his immune system could control @entity4 for a long period of time without his needing treatment			1
elite controllers , who make up 0.3 per cent of @entity4 patients , eventually require treatment to prevent progression to @entity55			0
but they can go a lot longer without treatment because their immune systems are more active against @entity4			2
the patient in the study had both hiv and myeloma , a cancer of the bone marrow			0
the bone marrow produces white blood cells , including those that help to control @entity4			0
pioneering new treatments for @entity4 , flu , ebola and cancer are being developed by scientists harnessing man - made dna			2
experts have discovered how to create strands of artificial dna , each mimicking a different killer disease , and inject them into patients			0
the idea is that the patients ' immune systems will then be able to recognise the threats and eliminate them			0
@entity82 , one of the companies behind the technique , has begun trials in humans , after strong results in the lab. the @entity90 company is using the method to attack flu , ebola and certain types of cancer â€“ as well as @entity4 and hepatitis			0
experts have already started trials on female patients to see if they can stop them developing cervical cancer			0
to treat the patient 's myeloma , his bone marrow was completely removed and replaced using his own stem cells			0
when the bone marrow was removed , the immune system was severely impaired , allowing the @entity4 to re-activate and replicate			1
this caused the level of virus in his bloodstream to rise from fewer than 50 copies per millilitre to approximately 28,000 copies per ml before is immune system 's function returned			1
when the patient 's immune function returned about two weeks after the transplant , the levels of @entity4 in his bloodstream rapidly fell			1
his immune system reduced @entity4 levels at a similar rate to the most powerful treatments available , bringing them back down to 50 copies per ml within six weeks			2
professor @entity127 , also of @entity22 , said : ' by measuring the strength of the immune system required to keep this virus under control in this rare individual , we have a better idea of the requirements for successful future treatment			1
' we also managed to identify the specific immune cells that fought the infection			0
' this is a single patient study , but nevertheless it is often the unusual patients who help us to understand the hiv disease process			0
' the man was not given any anti-hiv drugs , due to concerns about side - effects affecting his cancer treatment			0
the researchers noted it is possible that an equally strong immune response in combination with powerful drugs could have cured the @entity4 completely , however they state that is far from certain			0
dr @entity33 , of @entity22 , said : ' our study shows that the immune system can be as powerful as the most potent combination drug cocktails			2
we 're still a long way from being able to cure @entity4 patients , but this study takes us one step closer , showing us what type of immune responses an effective vaccine should induce ' ' we need to be cautious in interpreting observations from a single subject , ' said dr @entity167 , who began working on the study at the @entity23 and is now at the @entity24 at @entity168			2
' however , demonstration even from a single subject , that our immune system can rapidly control @entity4 - 1 tells us a lot about the types of immune responses we should target and augment through vaccination			1
' dr @entity33 adds : ' drugs to stimulate reactivation of dormant @entity4 are still imperfect , and we do not know if they would be able to flush out all of the @entity4 from the body			1
' likewise , it remains to be seen whether a vaccine could enable a normal @entity4 patient 's immune system to kill @entity4 with the full strength of an elite controller			1
' our study is a proof of principle and the results are promising , but it is unlikely to lead to a cure for at least a decade			0
' the study was published in the journal @entity193 .			0

scientists believe future vaccine could trigger body 's immune system
could flush out dormant @entity4 hiding in the body allowing the immune system to identify and target virus cells
theory based on one case study , 59 - year - old man with @entity4 whose virus load - *amount* of @entity4 in his blood - drop *dramatically* after treatment
