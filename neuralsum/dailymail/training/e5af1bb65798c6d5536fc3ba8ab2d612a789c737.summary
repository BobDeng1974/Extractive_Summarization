the currency , created in 2009 , can buy you everything from soap to illegal drugs and bee - keeping equipment			2
but @entity27 and @entity6 are determined to find out if they can survive using @entity5 in the real world			1
' the idea is to push the outer limits of what 's possible with bitcoins , ' 29 - year - old @entity6 told the @entity47			2
' a lot of what this documentary is going to be is us figuring it out and having a camera along with us			0
' newlyweds : the experiment will begin after the couple , pictured , return from their honeymoon on july 27 support : the pair have raised more than $ 3,750 plus bitcoins after campaigning on @entity62 , pictured the couple are raising money - and bitcoins - for the documentary and have made a video for their @entity62 page explaining their unique mission			0

' road trip : the couple , pictured , is planning to buy a car and go on a road trip using @entity5 food : groceries and everyday expenses will also have to be paid for with the virtual currency other transactions will also take some serious negotiation , particularly when they leave the safety net of friends and family and hit the road , in a car they 've , hopefully , managed to buy with bitcoins			1
' it 's going to be talking to people , explaining how @entity5 works , why it 's beneficial , and persuading them that we can do this and it will be very painless for you , ' @entity6 said			2
if things are going really well , the couple hope to use the currency to travel to another country - one where @entity5 has support			1
but that will require them to find a travel agency or airline that will take them , and that may prove a feat too much .			0
