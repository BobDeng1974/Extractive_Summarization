by @entity0 experts are recreating the assassination of archduke @entity3 to establish whether a contemporary bulletproof vest could have prevented @entity5			1
by using a replica of a silk vest said to have been owned by the @entity3 , and a pistol of the same type used to murder @entity3 and his wife @entity13 , researchers at the @entity7 in @entity8 hope to find out whether the @entity5 could have been stopped			1
it is thought that the @entity3 owned a piece of silk bodyarmour , but that he did not wear it on the fatal morning in @entity17 in june 1914			1
could this have stopped the war ? researchers in @entity8 are set to test a replica of a silk bulletproof vest thought to have been owned by archduke @entity3 and a pistol like the one used to murder him in 1914 historic moment : archduke @entity3 and his wife duchess @entity13 , pictured in the back of their car shortly before the assassination in @entity17 on june 28 , 1914 the assassination of @entity3 and @entity13 by @entity32 nationalist @entity30 on june 28 , 1914 , is widely acknowledged to have sparked the outbreak of the @entity5			1
the idea of the re-creation of the event came after @entity37 , a @entity7 ' @entity5 researcher , found a pistol almost identical to the one used by @entity30			1
‘ i stumbled across a @entity41 self - loading pistol , the same type used to assassinate the @entity3 , ’ ms @entity37 said			1
‘ upon examining its serial number , i realised it was only 516 away from the actual pistol used in the assassination and would probably have been manufactured around the same time			0
‘ this made me think about the ' what if scenario ' surrounding the death of the @entity3			2
if he had n't been killed , would the war have been delayed ? it is thought @entity3 owned a silk bulletproof vest like the one pictured here , but he did not wear it on the fatal morning in @entity17 historic event : an painting from july 1914 , depicts the moment @entity32 separatist @entity30 shoots @entity3 and @entity13 ‘ after months of independent research in international archives and with the assistance of international academics on the subject , i discovered that it was entirely possible that the @entity3 may have owned a piece of body armour			1
’ now experts at the @entity69 in @entity8 have tried to replicate the conditions of the @entity3 's assassination , to make testing as accurate as possible			2
@entity7 ' tests involve recreating replica silk vests , made to the original patent 's specifications			2
sharpshooting : the researchers will test the vest against the 1914 pistol these replicas have been fired at with the same type of pistol and ammunition and from the same distance as the original event			1
ms @entity37 said : ‘ our first world war team thought it would be interesting to test the theory of silk body armour against the @entity41 , to understand the ballistic capabilities of 19th century body armour against 20th century firepower			2
’ ‘ i do n't want to pre-empt the next round of tests , however i can report that silk does have bullet - stopping capabilities ! so this research could result in very exciting results			0
’ the vests were created by a priest - turned - inventor @entity100 , whose product were sold globally and were bought by @entity104 royalty and heads of state			0
his armour comprised organic layers , most notably silk , which had the ability to resist bullets			0
further experiments to test the capabilities of late 19th century body armour against20th century firepower will go ahead in early september			0
however , initial results have borne out a widely - held theory that silk does have bullet - stopping capabilities			0
this research will also form part of a new permanent exhibition at the @entity7 in @entity8 , called ' @entity121 ' , which is due to open in september			0
ms @entity37 will also present an international paper focused on the research at the @entity124 in @entity125 , which runs from july 29 to august 2 .			0

@entity3 and wife @entity13 were shot dead on june 28 , 1914
experts test replica jacket with pistol identical to one used in @entity17
it is thought @entity3 owned silk vest , but did not wear it that *day*
researchers hope to find out whether @entity5 could have been stopped
