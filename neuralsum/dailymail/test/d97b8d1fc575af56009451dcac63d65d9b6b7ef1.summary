@entity0 , who were hoping to avoid a fifth straight defeat , continued to produce the better football and chances throughout what was a stop - start first half			2
@entity27 blew a good opportunity for the home side when @entity89 guided a @entity36 free - kick back across goal and into the striker 's path , but he headed well over under little pressure			0
@entity33 also missed a big chance when @entity25 slipped him the ball from a well - worked move			2
the midfielder delayed his shot and eventually dragged it wide of @entity23 's goal			0

the former @entity104 striker celebrates his goal at the @entity16 @entity25 is congratulated by his team - mates after putting the home side a goal up on monday they started the second half far better and @entity53 , just moments after being booked for blocking a kick from goalkeeper @entity28 , should have put the visitors on level terms			2
the @entity113 international was put clean through on goal but a heavy touch gave @entity28 the advantage and he managed to deny @entity53 a path to goal with a diving save			0
the lively @entity102 then flashed a dangerous cross into the box which @entity27 poked just over his own bar for a @entity2 corner			0
at the right end , @entity27 dragged an effort just wide of the mark before a good interception from @entity30 stopped @entity102 from getting in on goal			0

down the other flank @entity32 laid on a big chance for @entity25 to score his second but his shot on the angle was palmed away by @entity23			0
@entity72 then miscued a volley wide for the visitors but was then replaced by @entity141 , who was just inches away from making an immediate impact when he narrowly failed to get a touch on to @entity53 's dangerous looking centre			0
@entity2 's @entity145 holds off the challenge of @entity29 during the clash on saturday @entity0 manager @entity46 shows the players how it 's done with a net bit of control on the touchline			1
