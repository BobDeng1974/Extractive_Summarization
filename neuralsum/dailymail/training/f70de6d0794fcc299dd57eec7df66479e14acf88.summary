@entity1 football should set a target of at least 20 per cent of professional coaches being from black and ethnic minority backgrounds by 2020 , according to a new report			1
the report , carried out by the @entity10 's @entity9 ( @entity11 ) , has revealed @entity5 coaches fill only 3.4 per cent of positions in @entity1 , despite making up 25 per cent of professional players			1
figures also show 19 out of the 552 senior coaching positions at @entity1 's 92 league clubs are currently held by coaches from @entity5 backgrounds , who make up just 6.4 per cent of those with the @entity23 - @entity1 's top coaching qualification			1
@entity24 , pictured outside @entity25 ( left ) and playing for @entity26 during his career , is a founding member of the think tank @entity28 who have funded the research the research , funded by @entity28 ( @entity32 ) , points to ' institutional discrimination ' and is urging governing bodies to set ' an overall target of at least 20 per cent of coaches in professional football be from @entity5 backgrounds by 2020 '			1
former @entity26 , @entity38 and @entity39 striker @entity24 , who is a founding member of the think tank , told a meeting with mps on monday : ' i 'm confident this report will increase the pressure because this debate has been going on a long time			0
' ten years ago we had three black managers , this season we had no black managers so it 's not a matter of time			2
' there 's a hidden resistance in football stopping managers coming through			1
' @entity24 added in the report : ' it appears that football has lost successive generations of potential coaches and managers simply because they are black or from other ethnic minority backgrounds			1
' the numbers do not add up , so many players from our communities who have achieved so much on the field of play - distinguished careers as senior players in some of the biggest clubs in this country , many with international caps , some who played at major tournaments - yet so few that have been given opportunities to achieve as coaches			2
' talk to these individuals about the realities they faced , the number of jobs they applied for , the number of interviews they had , and the feeling emerges that they have been the victims of a systematic denial of talent and ambition			0
' @entity88 is one of the 3.4 per cent of black and ethnic minority ( @entity5 ) coaches employed in @entity1 to boost the number of @entity5 coaches in @entity1 football , @entity11 recommends a ' positive action scheme ' similar to that used in @entity97 's @entity96 , which makes it compulsory for employers to interview minority candidates			1
it also put forward plans for networking events aimed at extinguishing an ' insider culture ' where jobs are handed out based on ' who you know , not what you know '			0
@entity110 's dr @entity109 , who carried out the report , concluded : ' taken together , these findings highlight the limited transition of @entity5 players into coaching and leadership positions in @entity1 professional football and the overwhelmingly @entity119 landscape of the senior decision making tiers of the sport			1
' @entity124 chief executive @entity123 attended the meeting in @entity126 along with several football figures , including @entity129 head of football operations @entity128 and former @entity132 first - team coach @entity131 , who now works with @entity129 's academy			2
@entity123 said : ' nowhere can the global village be seen better than on a football field but there is a stage two - an average playing career is only eight years			0
' there is a clear , blatant and obvious piece of the jigsaw missing with regard to management and coaches			0
more than 25 per cent of players are from @entity5 background , including @entity147 and @entity148 ' people always say why you ca n't do things but we can because any sane and right - minded person would know it is a natural follow - through			1
' you can have top - class black managers the same as you can have top - class black players			2
that 's what this campaign is about			0
' it 's not just an opinion now - it 's an argument based on facts , reason and logic			0
' the @entity170 's @entity169 chair @entity168 said the governing body welcomed the report			0
' it adds further evidence that bodies across the game need to work together to challenge discrimination , ' she said in a statement on the @entity170 website			0
' this report underlines why we all need to continue to work together , to address the lack of @entity184 representation beyond the pitch and the ' closed systems ' which maintain it			0
' at the @entity170 , we are committed to the long term programme of change from working with the @entity124 on preparing ex-players for the boardroom with the @entity193 programme , to developing our coach educator workforce from @entity184 backgrounds and introducing new mentoring opportunities for @entity184 coaches with the @entity1 development teams			2
' we look forward to discussing these ideas with the fare network and the @entity10 's @entity9 and also working with the sports minister to bring all parties together to maintain the momentum of change and build , on the work already under way across the game			1
