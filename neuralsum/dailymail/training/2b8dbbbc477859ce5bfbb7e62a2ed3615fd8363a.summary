by @entity0 the revolutionary technology behind 3d - printed car parts , food and guns can also be used to print batteries smaller than a grain of sand			1
scientists have used a 3d printer to make linthium - ion microbatteries that can fit into tiny devices that had previously stumped engineers looking to power them for longer periods			1
the batteries were constructed from interlaced stacks of tiny battery electrodes , which conduct electricity , that are each smaller than the width of a single human hair			1
' not only did we demonstrate for the first time that we can 3d - print a battery ; we demonstrated it in the most rigorous way , ' said the senior author of the study , @entity41 , according to a press release by @entity30 's @entity44 , where @entity45 is a professor			1
many engineers have developed miniaturized electronic devices , such as miniscule medical implants , insect - like flying robots and audio and visual recorders that can fit on a pair of glasses			0
the batteries normally used to power such gadgets were too large , so manufacturers would use ultra-thin films of solid materials to build the electrodes			2
but these did n't provide enough power			0
@entity45 and her colleagues realized they could pack more energy on a small scale if they could create stacks of interlaced , ultra-thin electrodes built from plane			1
they knew 3d printing would allow them to precisely build the battery			0
the team expanded on the functional ' inks ' the printer uses , designing some with useful chemical and electrical properties			0
the inks @entity45 ' group created had to function as electrochemically active materials , while also being capable of exiting a 3d printer 's fine nozzle and hardening in its final form			1
the ink they developed for the anode part of the battery -- or the ' negative ' side in a @entity89 -- is made with nanoparticles of one lithium metal oxide compound			0
ink for the cathode -- the ' positive ' side -- was made from another compound			0
printed : to create the mini battery , a 3d printer releases special inks that create the batteries ' electrodes ( red and purple )			1
the interlaced stacks are place in a case and an electrolyte solution is added the team 's 3d printer interlaced stacks of these inks on teeth of tiny gold combs			1
the team then put it in a container filled with an electrolyte solution to complete the battery			0
' the electrochemical performance is comparable to commercial batteries in terms of charge and discharge rate , cycle life and energy densities			0
we ’re just able to achieve this on a much smaller scale , ' said the co-author of the study , @entity129 , assistant professor at @entity31			2
the founding director of the @entity44 lauded the development for its practical applications			0
' @entity41 's innovative microbattery ink designs dramatically expand the practical uses of @entity135 , and simultaneously open up entirely new possibilities for miniaturization of all types of devices , both medical and non-medical			2
it ’s tremendously exciting , ' said @entity143 , who is also a professor of bioengineering at @entity30 .			2

batteries were constructed from interlaced stacks of tiny electrodes , which conduct electricity , smaller than the width of a human hair
the microbatteries can be used in devices too small for older batteries
researchers at @entity30 and @entity31 created electrochemically active ink for their *custom* 3d printer
