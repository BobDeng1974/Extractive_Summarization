tricks considered harmful or degrading to dogs are to be banned from competitions after a boom in extreme routines following @entity6 's success on @entity8 's @entity7			1
the dog and handler @entity6 ’s victory prompted a 20 per cent rise in interest in competitive dog - dancing events			1
but the @entity14 – which governs all such events in the @entity8 – is set to introduce rule changes banning certain techniques , to come into effect next year			0
the @entity14 say owners should not allow dogs to do the move for more than ten seconds off limits : the @entity14 are worried that dogs could slip when attempting the foot stand , made popular by @entity6 and handler @entity6 , pictured @entity6 impressed viewers by walking on his hind legs - but dogs will now only be allowed to perform this move for ten seconds			1
he also jumped on to 17 - year - old @entity6 's shoulders to the @entity36 theme tune - a crowd - pleasing move that will also now be forbidden because it could could a strain			1
the @entity42 star 's jumps and pirouettes brought a smile to armchair tv fans across the country , but ' extreme ' or ' unnatural ' positions have been deemed potentially dangerous and liable to cause injury			0
the @entity14 labelled other aspects of some routines - including dressing dogs up - degrading to the animals			1
it fears that with the rise in popularity of the pastime , owners will attempt riskier moves			1
@entity14 secretary @entity58 explained : ' we know that the more people we get into the sport , the more they are going to have to look to other types of moves in order to make an impact			2
' ‘ we are trying to pre-empt that			0
the priority is the dog ’s safety			2
' we have used @entity6 and @entity6 as an opportunity to encourage young people to get into it			1
’ she said the success of @entity6 - a border collie , bichon frise and @entity78 crested cross - had been good for encouraging owners to be more active with the dogs , but she wants to ensure they do n't go too far			1
in future competitions any pair completing a performance considered unnatural , degrading or extreme will be banned			2
she added that dogs wearing fancy dress costumes would definitely not be tolerated			1
' we are trying to stop what we would see as demeaning for the dog , ' she said			2
' they are allowed to wear a certain amount - perhaps the equivalent of a dog coat			2
but we would absolutely not expect the dog to turn up in a full @entity96 kit , for instance			2
' nationally , there are just under a hundred clubs that offer dog dancing activities			1
health and safety : move including the shoulder jump , right , and walking on hind legs , right , will be banned popular : @entity6 leans against @entity6 with his front paws during the final of @entity8 's @entity7 in front of judges @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 @entity8 's @entity7 winner @entity6 , who became the first dog owner to win the competition when her dog @entity6 scooped first prize , is a member of the @entity14			1
at club events , dogs perform routines to music in sets of up to four minutes duration			0
most shows feature two categories - heelwork and freestyle			0
the latter gives owners the opportunity to try out more innovative tricks			0
each discipline is scored on content , accuracy and musical interpretation			0
the new rules formally come into effect next year , but the @entity14 has asked owners to observe the new laws in spirit from now			0
victory leap : however , dogs will still be allowed to perform jumps like this one dog owners breaking the new rules face being disqualified			1
@entity143 spokeswoman @entity142 said : ' if anything leads to the animal 's discomfort then this should of course be stopped			0
' learning tricks and obedience ( provided it is done in the right way ) can be positive for a dog			0
' we think that this is a distraction from the main welfare concerns associated with the improper breeding of pedigree dogs			0
' we 'd like to see the @entity14 concentrate its efforts in helping to bring an end to breathing difficulties , epilepsy , spinal problems and other serious health issues associated with pedigree dogs			0
' high flier : most shows feature two categories - heelwork and freestyle			0
the latter gives owners the opportunity to try out more innovative tricks			0
