my fight with @entity0 : @entity1 skier @entity0 's ex-girlfriend @entity12 reluctantly agreed to a temporary four - month custody truce with the star in @entity5 on monday @entity12 told reporters outside the court that she reluctantly agreed to the truce until august - rather than pushing for full custody at the advice of her lawyers			1
attorney 's for the pair worked out a seven - page agreement to enable shared custody until the end of summer , that leaves @entity12 the primary caregiver			1
the two warring parties will meet back in court in @entity5 in september , where a psychologist will evaluate the child 's well - being and how the arrangement is working			2
however , @entity12 was critically of the plan , especially the element which guarantees @entity6 chats for six - time olympic medal winner @entity0			1
' he ’s interested for 45 seconds , then he ’s off , ' @entity12 said of their young son to the @entity66			2
' it ’s an inadequate substitute for being there — you ca n’t hug him or touch him			0
' despite the ceasing of hostilities for now , the custody battle has been one of the fiercest bi-coastal battles in recent memory			0
the two first met through the high - end matchmaking service @entity78 and were a couple for three months			0
battle : @entity0 and @entity81 with @entity0 's son - who he calls @entity35 at their home in @entity9 father : @entity0 with his 14 - month - old son - who will be shared between him and the boy 's mother , @entity12 for the next four months separated : in september , @entity12 lost custody of @entity3 to @entity0 and the boy went to live with his skier dad and step - mom in @entity9			1
@entity3 and step - mom pictured above however , they split shortly after @entity12 became pregnant because @entity0 met professional volleyball player @entity81 , whom he married			1
at the commencement of the custody battle last spring , @entity0 had not even met his three - month - old son and tried to take full custody from @entity12 , claiming that because he lived in @entity9 , it was illogical for his son to live in the @entity100			1
@entity12 , who was also a former firefighter , moved to @entity22 so she could study at @entity101 last year			1
@entity102 approved the custody deal , saying , ' it does appear to be in the child 's best interest inasmuch as it provides for substantial time with each parent			2
' earlier this month , @entity12 outlined her emotional turmoil as she claimed her son had trouble recognizing her because the @entity111 had kept him away from her for so long			2
@entity0 and his wife @entity81 had custody of ' @entity35 ' for five weeks in march and had originally agreed to allow @entity12 to have custody of the boy for the whole month of april			1

the month before , @entity12 wrote in @entity134 how difficult the entire custody battle has become and her side of the dispute			2
three months into their relationship , @entity12 learned she was pregnant but when she told @entity0 he was less than enthused			2
' i told him i wanted to keep the baby			0
i said he could be involved if he wanted to and that i would love it if he did			0
if he did n't want any part of it , i said that i was going to do it on my own , ' @entity12 wrote in an essay for @entity134			0
' i left in tears			0
' knowing that she could n't continue to balance working as a firefighter and being a single mother , @entity12 decided to move to @entity22 to attend prestigious @entity101 on the @entity150			1
reunited : @entity12 won custody of @entity3 back in november and the two are currently together in @entity22 in addition to @entity101 being a highly - competitive school , @entity12 chose the @entity22 school because there were breast - feeding rooms on campus and family networks that would help her to raise @entity3			1
a month before she moved , @entity12 texted @entity0 to let him know her plans but she says he never responded			1
she was seven - months - pregnant when she arrived in @entity22 and took up her studies one month later			2
son @entity162 was born on february 23 , 2013 and she filed for temporary custody of the child three days later			2
but when @entity3 was just two weeks old , @entity12 learned that her ex-boyfriend and filed for custody of the child despite never expressing any interest in being the boy 's father			2
@entity0 and wife @entity81 had also experienced a miscarriage that january			2
@entity0 sent the custody papers to her home in @entity173 , despite knowing she did n't live there , and that set off a complex multi-state custody battle			0
eventually the case was sent back to @entity9 and on september 4 , a judge gave @entity0 full - custody of @entity3 calling @entity12 's move to @entity22 ' irresponsible ' and ' irreprehensible '			1
husband and wife : @entity0 married @entity81 ( pictured above at @entity130 in february ) in october 2012 and the two lost a child in a miscarriage the following january after losing @entity3 , @entity12 's life turned into a ' nightmare ' and she quit school and her job			1
but she soon realized that being ' catatonic was n't helping matters '			0
and she re-enrolled and continued her studies while relentlessly pursuing a way to get @entity3 back for good			0
all the while @entity12 tracked her son 's life with @entity0 on her ex and his new wife 's social media profiles and noticed they were calling him ' @entity199 '			1
' i would look for photos of @entity3 on @entity202 and @entity203 and saw that @entity0 was calling him @entity199			0
our son ’s name is @entity162			0
calling him anything else is just confusing			0
' there were also tons of photos of @entity0 ’s wife holding @entity3 like he was her baby			0
that was very hard to bear , ' @entity12 added			0
the next time @entity12 saw her son was at a court hearing on november 25 where she won back custody of @entity3			1
' i was sitting in court when i heard @entity3 ’s sweet little voice down the hall			0
as soon as i saw him , i reached out and said , ' i missed you ! ' he put his arms out for me and said , “ mama ! ” we still had to deal with a court hearing that day , but i did n’t care			0
the next day was my birthday			0
i woke up next to @entity3 , and he started giggling — that was the best present i ’ve ever received in my life , ' she said			0
@entity12 is back living in @entity22 and hopes to work out stable life for @entity3 where he can see both of his parents			0
' that 's all i want for our son , ' she wrote			0
the experience of losing her son has also inspired her studies as she is now pursuing a law degree to help others in her position .			0
