@entity0 , who is being investigated over whether he had hidden assets as @entity3 prosecutors try to recoup £ 750,000 disgraced @entity5 spin doctor @entity0 is being investigated over whether he has hidden assets as @entity3 prosecutors try to recoup £ 750,000 in costs from him			1
the 46 - year - old , jailed for 18 months for phone hacking , must account for millions of pounds received after he quit as @entity12 editor in 2007			1
prosecutor @entity13 said : ‘ a lot of money passed through mr @entity0 ’s hands and there does n’t seem to be very much left			2
we want to investigate where the money has gone			2
’ @entity0 received a £ 600,000 settlement when he resigned as editor of the @entity12 and was recruited by the @entity23 months later as director of communications on £ 475,000 a year , which fell to £ 180,000 when he moved to @entity26 in 2010			1
the married father - of - three resigned as mr @entity29 ’s spin doctor in january 2011 and set up a pr consultancy with his wife @entity31 but has not worked full - time since he was charged with phone hacking in 2012			1
his legal costs in the trial were covered by his former employers at @entity36 , the publishers of the @entity12 , after he took the firm to the @entity38 to force them to pay			2
it is not clear if the @entity41 newspaper empire will also cover his share of the @entity44 costs			0
if it does not the court will assess @entity0 ’s own assets			0
his assets include his family home in @entity49 , @entity50 , which he shares with his wife and three young sons , although it would be unusual for a family home to be seized to cover @entity44 costs			0
the couple sold their £ 1.5million five - bedroom @entity58 home in @entity61 , @entity62 , after he was charged and downsized to a £ 600,000 house near @entity64			1
mr @entity65 said the prosecution would investigate if other assets had been hidden			0
he told the @entity68 : ‘ in a situation such as this , where someone anticipates they might be convicted having been charged in 2012 , it is not at all uncommon for transfers of money to take place whereby they are no longer in his ownership but might still be accessible to him if the need should arise			0

@entity0 has been held in top - security @entity106 in @entity62 while a decision is made over the retrial			0
trial judge mr @entity109 said he was ‘ concerned ’ that @entity0 was still in @entity106 and would write to the prison governor			0
a non-violent criminal serving a comparatively short sentence would normally only be taken to @entity106 for assessment before being transferred to a lower security jail			0
mr @entity109 said : ‘ i am concerned to hear that mr @entity0 is remaining at @entity106 because of the possibility of the retrial taking place			0
