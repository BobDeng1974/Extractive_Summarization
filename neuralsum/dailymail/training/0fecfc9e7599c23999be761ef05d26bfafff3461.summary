these remarkable shots reveal just how easy it is to fake dramatic weight loss in just 15 minutes			1
@entity4 personal trainer @entity3 recreated her own inspirational weight loss images , posted to her blog @entity6 , using some clever tricks used by the billion - dollar diet and fitness industries in before - and - after photos			1
inspired by personal trainer @entity12 's step - by - step guide to faking a dramatic transformation , @entity3 posted two pictures of herself showing the difference a change of lighting and bigger underpants can make in just 15 minutes			1
myth busting : @entity3 's ' before ' and ' after ' pictures were taken within 15 minutes of each other , with the personal trainer using tricks of the trade to give the impression she lost weight @entity3 then explained on her blog how she did it			1
for her first unflattering picture ( left ) , the trainer ate a big breakfast , wore her tight bather bottoms and let her body sag			2
but within 15 minutes , @entity3 transformed herself into a lean and fit glamazon just by employing these tricks ( right )			1
she changed her bather bottoms from red to black , ' cause they 're a size bigger & black is slimming ' , and ' smothered on some fake tan '			0
she clipped in long hair extensions , stood up a bit taller , sucked in her stomach , stood with legs wide and her hand on her ' popped ' hip , pulled back her shoulders and wore a ' cheeky ' grin			0
' zoomed in on the before pic - zoomed out on the after & added a filter			0
cause filters make everything awesome , ' @entity3 wrote			1
' what 's my point ? do n't be deceived by what you see in magazines & on @entity58 never see the dozens of other pics they took that wernt [ sic ] as flattering			2
photoshop can make a pig look hotter then @entity65			0
' i feel like these ' 2 week progress ' pictures set people up with unrealistic expectations of how fast they should be getting results			1
what a before and after shot does n’t tell you how the person achieved it			0
' illusion : @entity3 transformed herself in 15 minutes using body glow , make up , hair extensions , large black underpants and ditched the phone wallet concerned the before and after pictures often used in advertisements do n't take account of how people lost weight , @entity3 also posted ' a real life transformation photo that took a whole lot more effort than a few hair extensions and some fake tan '			1
the first picture of @entity3 ( left ) was taken in 2010 on a family holiday after a trip to @entity93 where she gained 17 pounds			2
' i went to @entity95 twice , i tried all the food , i drank almost every night , i went out dancing , i had desserts , and really had the most amazing time , ' she wrote			0
' although i remember feeling sh * * * y about my body in that photo , to be honest i did n’t really care that much - i knew i would lose the weight eventually			2
' i had lots of friends , i was confident , i went out all the time and people just gathered around me to soak up my awesomeness			0
. haha ok ok , maybe not , but i was pretty carefree ! ' the incredible ' after ' photo was taken three years later , when @entity3 had ' become obsessed with fitness ' , teaching eight classes a week as a fitness instructor and then becoming a personal trainer			1
over six months , she overhauled her diet , socially isolated herself , stopped weekend drinking and left parties early to gain a six - pack			0
' i become totally obsessed with my progress , i had my skin folds done weekly , i trained like a dog and rescheduled my photo shoot 2 times so that i would have ‘ more time ’ to get leaner , ' she wrote			2
' by the time the photo shoot finally happened it was almost 6 months later , i was exhausted , yeah i looked good on the outside - but i was a mess on the inside			0
i was tired , moody , i 'd tainted good friendships and i actually really hated the person i had become [ sic ]			0
' real before and after : the picture to the left was taken while @entity3 was on a gluttonous vacation in 2010 , while the picture to the right was shot in 2012 when @entity3 had lost 15 pounds through disciplined training @entity3 said the best way to change your body is not by buying into the misleading ' two week progress ' weight loss shots , but to ' learn about food , come up with an achievable plan and most importantly enjoy how you exercise and live your life			1
' ' oh and transformation shots are great , but let it be clear - that being thinner doesnt always mean youll be happier , transformations take time , and good lighting can make buddah have a 6 pack [ sic ] , ' she advised .			0
