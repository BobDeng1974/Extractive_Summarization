by @entity0 @entity1 may have been basking in glorious sunshine and balmy temperatures , but of course , as soon as @entity5 arrives , the weather is set to turn			1
and it seems festivalgoers are n't quite as die - hard as first thought , with hotel searches booming since forecaster warned of thundery showers and heavy downpours			1
as thousands descend upon @entity16 in @entity17 for this weekend 's festivities , one hotel website is reporting a huge surge in bookings for the @entity5 area , following the grim weather forecast			1
lapping up the sun , but could things be about to get a whole lot muddier ? get ready for the rain ! the sunshine today is expected to give way to heavy showers searches for hotels in the @entity5 area are up by 92 per cent , according to research from @entity33 , which also revealed that over a quarter of us ( 27 per cent ) would prefer to stay in a hotel than go through the traditional camping experience			1
interestingly , the research also reveals that a cheeky two per cent of festival goers even admit to lying to their friends and family about staying in a hotel when they said they were camping			1
thousands of festival - goers arrived at the @entity46 site yesterday , with even more expected today			1
but late arrivals were advised to get their tents up as quickly as possible before heavy rain dampens proceedings by the afternoon			2
idyllic : a balmy summer 's evening in the @entity53 are of @entity16 , but conditions could change later today in rainier times : @entity5 2011 had more than its share of downpours or would madam prefer breakfast in bed ? some festiival goers are seeking out plush hotels in @entity5 forecasters predict rain will last throughout the weekend and the @entity65 put out a yellow weather warning , warning that ' severe ' storms could disrupt transport and events			1
' this is not just a bit of rain , ' @entity70 of the @entity65 told @entity74			0

' sunday will be clearer , with some sunny spells , but there is still potential for showers			0

@entity96 spells and it will stay mild			2

@entity102 - @entity101 : @entity103			0
temperatures will peak at @entity105 , with heavy rain from 10am.sunday : less rain but it will remain overcast ' @entity5 have put a lot into dealing with floods so they may be prepared but we are looking at short , very sharp showers that will come too fast for normal drains to handle , causing localised flooding , ' a @entity65 spokesman said			0
' there has n't been a drop of rain in @entity46 for the past four weeks so it 's not going to get really muddy , ' said long time festival veteran @entity120			1
but it 's not a view shared by the @entity65 , which said that the lack of rain in recent weeks ' is likely to exacerbate the problems			0
' @entity5 has long been recognised as the festival which attracts the worst weather , but despite the mud it continues to attract more festival goers every year			2
' it 's great to see that rain or shine we will enjoy @entity5 ... even if there is a cunning minority who lie about where they stay just to keep up appearances , ' said @entity139 of @entity33			2
as @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 strut their stuff it seems the trend in ' glamping ' is n't going away any time soon .			0
