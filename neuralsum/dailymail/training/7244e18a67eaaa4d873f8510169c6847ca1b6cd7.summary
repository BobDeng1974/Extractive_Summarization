after motorists pulled into a garage , a man would emerge from a tiny kiosk , ask how many gallons were required and then proceed to ‘ fill her up ’			1
today , the drive for profits means they have been phased out and garages have become the 24 - hour self - service forecourts we all know			2
but in a remarkable turnaround , @entity16 is to reintroduce forecourt attendants at more than 300 of its sites by the end of the summer			1
the company , which has almost 1,000 petrol stations nationwide , believes that offering free , customer - friendly service to motorists will encourage loyalty faced with cut - price competition from supermarkets , the company , which has almost 1,000 petrol stations nationwide , believes that offering free , customer - friendly service to motorists will encourage loyalty			1
and in a throwback to a golden age of motoring , @entity16 ’s aa - trained staff will offer basic car maintenance , such as checking tyres , as well as handling the petrol pump			1
the service could prove popular with female motorists who have little knowledge of – or inclination to carry out – routine maintenance such as checking tyre pressures and topping up oil levels			1
‘ when we had a shift away from the old - style garage to modern petrol stations , it became all about keeping customers on the move , getting them in and out as quickly as possible , ’ said @entity46 , @entity16 ’s retail general manager			1
‘ today ’s motorists spend between £ 50 and £ 100 to fill up their vehicles and are increasingly time - poor , so they ’d much rather be somewhere else than standing on a forecourt pumping petrol			1

after motorists pulled into a garage , a man would emerge from a tiny kiosk , ask how many gallons were required and then proceed to ¿ fill her up ¿ ‘ our way means they can go inside while their tank is filled , buy a few bits and pieces and their fuel bill will be delivered to them at the kiosk , so there wo n’t be any slowing down of forecourt traffic			2
’ for many @entity78 drivers , their only experience of pump attendants is abroad , where it is often unclear whether they are being charged extra for the service or are expected to offer a tip. many @entity83 filling stations charge a premium for ‘ full service ’ , but @entity16 insists this will not apply to its new initiative			1
‘ the attendants will be easily recognisable in bright red uniforms with high - visibility stripes , ’ ms @entity46 added			0
‘ there will be a sign outside to say there ’s an attendant on duty – there will always be one attendant on hand during six to eight daylight hours , seven days a week			0
‘ they are a broad mix of age , gender and ethnicity and we plan to roll out this service to 600 locations by mid- 2013			2
’ the move was applauded by motoring groups			0
@entity110 , president of the @entity111 , said : ‘ in today ’s world of anonymous forecourts , putting someone there to help must be a welcome development			0
' it may also make solo women drivers feel safer having a human presence among the pumps			0
‘ a fair proportion of drivers do n’t know how to check tyre pressures and fluid levels			0
for that category of driver , an attendant on duty will be extremely helpful			0

@entity16 says the service will save *precious* time for busy motorists
the free , friendly service is expected to encourage customer loyalty
