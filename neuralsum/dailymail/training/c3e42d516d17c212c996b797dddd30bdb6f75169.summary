by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:17 est , 10 december 2013 @entity2 : 11:26 est , 10 december 2013 with her honey - streaked blonde locks , unlined skin and sweet smile , @entity7 , an actress and playwright , looks years younger than her real age of 51			1
but it 's possible that her preternaturally youthful looks are the result not of good skincare but the famous maxim : ' you 're only as old as the man you feel '			2
and for @entity7 , that means very young indeed			1
her boyfriend of just over a year , up - and - coming actor @entity19 , is just 26 years old			1
and for @entity7 , life with @entity19 is so good , she would n't change a single thing			1
' it 's been about 15 months and it 's going good , ' she says of her relationship			2
' he 's a very unusual young man and he 's very mature for his age			2
i feel i have a trusted equal partner and he 's never ever done anything to drive me up the wall ! ' wonderful though her other half is , she admits there have been moments where others have n't been quite so understanding			2
' i do wonder whether people are reacting to the age difference or the fact that we 're black and white , ' she muses			1
perfect match : @entity7 says shared values and @entity19 's maturity are the secret of their relationship open - minded : @entity7 says women should be more accepting of love that comes in an unconventional package ' but there has been no real opposition			1
perhaps it would be an issue if we were living in an all - white town in the countryside but here in @entity68 , people are more open minded			1
' the couple , who first met more than two years ago at a conference in @entity71 , were friends for 12 months before @entity19 finally made his move			1
' i think it [ the relationship ] works because of our shared value system , ' she explains			1
' obviously having children is a big issue but he 's not ready so not an issue yet			2
' what 's different is that we really love each other in the purest sense , so we will do what 's best for each other even if that means not being together			2
' despite acknowledging the potential pitfalls , @entity7 thinks its time women stopped fixating on age and opened themselves up to relationships with men they might not have considered			1
confidence : according to @entity7 , in order to catch your own dream man , feeling happy with yourself is key ' i never like to be limited by a label , ' she explains			1
' @entity103 does n't necessarily have the most positive connotations but people should open up to love , and if comes in form of someone younger , then do n't dismiss it			0
' before meeting @entity19 , i had rejected the idea of dating someone younger but he just wore me down			1
' i would tell other women to trust their insticts and go with the flow - love comes in all kinds of odd packages			0
' @entity7 and @entity19 appear in @entity25 on @entity26 , tuesdays at 10pm ' these are the only things that work , ' explains @entity7			1
' i got my heart smashed lots of times in the past but i learned ! ' love yourself ' it 's kind of like when you go to bank and they turn you down for loans			0
when you have money , you get the loan , and when you do n't , you do n't			0
love yourself and other people will too			0
' @entity129 ' be proud of who you are and do n't be afraid to own your age , weight , experience in life ... i feel much more secure now			2
i was such an insecure mess when younger and it 's not attractive			0
relax ' let the guy show you who he is			0
sometimes women so want to be partnered , that it all becomes too much so give him time to come to you and show you who he really is			0
' do n't lose sight of your own value ' do n't give away more than willing to lose			0
remember that you are valuable and let him work to please you			0
he will be happiest when he 's able to make you happy so do n't give it all away and make him work for it			0
remember you 're a goddess ' let him serve you and do n't go running after him			0
he gets to be a hero if you let him do for you			0
also , men do n't want to be with women who do n't need them , so let him know he 's wanted and needed , even if it 's just in small ways .			0
