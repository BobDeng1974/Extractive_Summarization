by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity3 ’s return journey to @entity4 has taken him via @entity6 ’s chat show on @entity8 television , where he was joined on camera by @entity10			1
the former @entity8 president not only expressed his unbounded admiration of the @entity3 as a boxer but endorsed him as a future leader of the @entity15			2
the man standing in the way of the first of those ambitions sees that celebrity shoulder - rubbing as further reason why he will beat the legendary @entity3 for a second time in the @entity23			0
he ’s lost the fire			0
’ @entity33 would be unwise to rely too much on his suspicion that @entity3 has gone into decline since he was awarded a quite scandalous points victory over him in their first fight			1
or that the @entity3 ’s political duties as a senator and champion of the poor in his country are such a distraction that he has lost a vital measure of his interest in proving himself one of the greatest fighters of his generation			2
@entity3 , although respectful of @entity33 , remains deeply aggravated by the blinkered @entity51 judges who consigned him to the first of two defeats which jeopardised his ring career			1
fully focused ? @entity33 has accused @entity3 of taking his mind off the game defending champion : @entity33 can inflict the third defeat of @entity3 's glittering career on saturday night in a way , the spectacular knockout loss which followed was fuelled by the need he felt to look impressive in his fourth battle with @entity64			1
sensing he was about to stop his bitter @entity66 rival , @entity3 stayed in range too long and was caught by desperate punch			0
@entity33 also draws encouragement from @entity3 , in his comeback fight from that upset , failing to apply the knockout to @entity73 despite comprehensively out - classing him over 12 rounds			1
@entity3 had shown signs of showing sympathy and easing up against inferior opponents previously , @entity33 among them			1
but now his master - trainer @entity78 has spent months instilling in him the need to go for the kill when he has a man in trouble ... not least to avoid leaving himself at the mercy of incompetent or prejudiced judges			2
‘ i want @entity3 to go for the ko against @entity33 , ’ says @entity78			1
‘ and i expect him to get it			0
’ masters at work : trainer @entity78 says @entity3 will ko his @entity8 opponent in @entity90 grudge match : @entity33 celebrates with the welterweight belt after beating the @entity15 almost two years ago if he ’s right , it would make the powerful statement which even @entity95 would find hard to ignore			1
@entity33 is unbeaten in 33 fights			2
in the most recent of those , last october , he cleverly and clearly out - pointed @entity64 , and he has certainly developed as a boxer since that first meeting with @entity3 two years ago			0
however , @entity3 has much to prove – and even more money than usual to look forward to if he can arouse the public to harass @entity95 into meeting him in what would - be the richest fight in ring history			2
i have no idea how much mr @entity10 knows about boxing but as a genius at political survival he can certainly recognise the qualities of a committed professional in - fighter when he sees one			2
@entity33 acknowledges that the scoring controversy which blighted their first fight has hurt public perception of him and he , too , is eager reconfirm his reputation as a formidable boxer in his own right			1
but when he warns ‘ this fight will not go the distance ’ he may find @entity3 only too willing to endorse that prediction ... albeit not in the way he means it			0
@entity124 fully deserves to be viewed as the heir apparent to his own mentor , the great @entity126 , in the firmament of @entity129 boxing			1
the super-bantamweight from the @entity131 of @entity132 is bringing back to @entity133 the roaring atmosphere which pervaded @entity126 ’s own ascent to world championship glory			0
by intimidating @entity137 into defeat at the weekend , @entity124 laid mandatory claim to a first world title shot of his own and promoter @entity126 hopes to tempt the @entity143 champion to @entity132 later this year , possibly for a stadium fight			1
home comforts : @entity124 ( right ) was in scintillating form , beating @entity66 @entity137 inside two rounds in his native @entity132 mentor : the great @entity126 cheers his protege 's victory in front of a partisan crowd even as that prospect opened up temptation appeared in the shape of @entity157 , who promptly volunteered to bring his @entity159 , @entity34 and @entity160 belts across the @entity161 , @entity124 and @entity126			1
@entity157 , as a two - time olympic gold medallist , was one of the greatest amateur boxers of all time			0
since defecting from @entity165 he has won his first world title on only his ninth professional outing and gone on to totally outclass and bewilder @entity168 , the @entity15 touted as the next @entity3 , in a unification bout			0
@entity170 ’s own @entity172 trainer , @entity78 , describes @entity157 as ‘ probably the greatest talent i ’ve ever seen			0
’ future opponent : the dangerous @entity157 awaits somewhere on the horizon for @entity124 in terms of punching accuracy , mastery of the noble art of self - defence and pure skill it is hard to argue , even though @entity8 audiences have not yet taken to his elusive style			2
so @entity124 and @entity126 need to stick with @entity185 , hopefully overcome @entity186 wherever that happens and develop towards a @entity157 fight as the @entity165 , now 33 , ages a little and his phenomenal reflexes slow a fraction			1
at the moment , @entity157 is a man you ca n’t hit			0
@entity186 is a fight @entity124 can win			0
as @entity197 ’s right eye closed – and his vision of becoming a two - weight world champion disappeared from his sight – some of boxing ’s old - stagers took to wondering why his corner did not apply a rather gruesome remedy of the past to the swelling			1
@entity197 was wounded by a clash of heads in the first round of his challenge for @entity210 ’s @entity159 light - heavyweight title in @entity211 , @entity212			0
the swelling around the eye ballooned up as he took a couple of left hooks to the damaged area from @entity210 , who himself had suffered a cut eye in the collision			0
warrior : @entity197 battled on for four rounds with this nasty eye injury a sorry sight : @entity197 's title dreams were ended as his cornerman threw in the towel @entity197 gamely fought on but as he took increasing punishment from punches he could not see , trainer @entity229 pulled him out at the end of the fifth			1
in years gone by fabled @entity8 corner - men – @entity234 ’s trainer @entity233 prominent among them – would have bled out the pus by taking a razor - blade to slit the engorged area			0
old master : @entity233 ( right ) attends to @entity234 ( then @entity234 ) during his 1966 victory against @entity241 since the worst of the swelling was below the eye , that primitive option was open to @entity245 is a brave man who no doubt would have agreed had they put it to him			0
instead , still only 33 but with several heavy @entity250 among his seven defeats , he is left to ponder whether this particular retirement should become permanent .			2

@entity3 appeared on the @entity27 with @entity10 , giving @entity33 more belief that the former champ has lost his fire
@entity3 remains deeply aggravated by the blinkered @entity51 judges who consigned him to defeat against @entity33 in 2012
@entity3 's coach @entity78 has said : ' i want @entity3 to go for the ko against @entity33 . and i expect him to get it . '
@entity264 acknowledges that the scoring controversy hurt public perception of him and he , too , is eager reconfirm his reputation
@entity124 fully deserves to be viewed as the heir apparent to his own mentor , the great @entity126 , in the firmament of @entity129 boxing
after a gruesome eye injury , @entity197 is still only 33 but is left to ponder his future in the hardest game
