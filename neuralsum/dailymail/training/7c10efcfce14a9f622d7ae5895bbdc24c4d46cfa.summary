for four decades , he has negotiated obstacles placed in his way by foes and erstwhile friends alike			0
but tonight , an emotional @entity5 announced his retirement from frontline politics after he was defeated by @entity8 in the election for @entity10			1
he said it would be his ' last election ' and that he was ' sincerely sorry ' he had failed to win for @entity13 in ' the defeat i most regret '			1
mr @entity5 , 66 , said : ' this is my last election			1
forty one years ago , almost to the day , i won my first election promising to build good council housing and introduce a free bus pass for pensioners			2
' now i have lived long enough to get one myself			0
i did not think i necessary would at the time			0
since then , i have won 11 more elections and lost three			0
the candidates listen after the announcement of @entity8 's victory in the @entity27 mayoral elections at @entity28 tonight			1
@entity5 wells up with emotion at the news of his defeat as @entity8 was returned as @entity27 major tonight , a watery eyed @entity5 announced he would not stand again @entity5 stood in the background as @entity8 took centre stage in @entity28 tonight ' but the one that i most regret losing is this			1
this is the defeat i most regret , because these are the worst times for 80 years and @entity13 needed a mayor to help them get through this very difficult period			1
' in a closely fought race , mr @entity8 garnered 1,054,811 votes ( 51.53 per cent ) to mr @entity5 's 992,273 ( 48.47 per cent )			1
but there is no denying that ' @entity48 has had a good innings			0
way back in 1971 , when he first stood for @entity51 , he proved the master of the dark arts of political manipulation , propaganda and campaigning			0
@entity58 mp @entity57 with @entity5 - when he was leader of the @entity59 - in @entity60 in 1983 ' @entity5 became a bete noire of the @entity62 , supporting everyone from striking miners to @entity66 's leaders at the height of the @entity69 's bombing campaign			1
pictured with @entity66 mp @entity70 in 1989 @entity8 was re-elected as @entity10 in a surprisingly narrow victory that saw him beat rival @entity5			1
the @entity73 polled 1,054,811 to the @entity58 's candidate 's 992,273 following a deeply personal and bitter campaign battle that saw the two men clash furiously in public and in private			1
mr @entity8 vowed to continue ' fighting for a good deal for @entity13 ' from government as he thanked voters for giving him a ' new chance '			1
the mayor outperformed his party , which suffered a significant drubbing nationally , but failed to secure the massive win predicted by polls over recent days that had put him as far as 12 points ahead			2
early results in the contest also suggested the incumbent was significantly in the lead and even senior @entity58 figures conceded the @entity73 was poised to win			0
but later count declarations saw the gap reduce , fuelling speculation mr @entity8 's victory was not the done deal that had been tipped			1
no candidate won enough votes in the first round to secure victory , meaning second preferences had to be counted			2
@entity58 secured eight of the @entity105 's 14 first - past - the - post constituencies , gaining two from the @entity108 , which left them with six			0
in his most controversial years during the @entity111 and @entity112 , first as leader of the ultra-radical @entity59 and then as a hard - left mp for @entity110 , he was untouchable at the ballot box			0
even when @entity114 kicked him out of the @entity115 in a desperate bid to stop him becoming @entity27 mayor in 2000 , mr @entity5 still emerged triumphant having run as an independent			1
exactly four years ago , his political obituary was penned by many pundits after mr @entity8 dramatically brought to an end his eight - year reign at @entity28			1
reports of his demise proved as exaggerated as @entity124 's : within two years , he had not only secured the @entity58 candidacy for a fourth tilt but appeared well - set to return in triumph			2
but a seasoned campaigner famous for defying the odds has proved unable to win even when they were stacked in his favour - neither his personal nor political magic working on @entity13			1
and now that door has firmly closed			0
it is impossible to imagine @entity58 - the party which once begged him to return to the fold - will ever again invest in mr @entity5 as the answer to its prayers in the capital			2
as his campaign unravelled - in the main thanks to controversy over his personal taxes - high - profile @entity58 figures lined up to express regrets at his return and tell voters not to back him			0
such was the poisoned atmosphere that @entity58 election chief @entity149 went so far as to say that voters should ' hold their noses ' and vote for his own party 's candidate			2
that was a sentiment echoed by an eve - of - poll editorial in @entity156			0
in his heyday he was the left - wing thorn in the side of the @entity108 - @entity160 resorted to legislation to remove him in 1986 - as well as @entity114 's @entity163 which was so determined to exclude him that it stitched up the selection process , to disastrous effect			0
@entity5 and actress @entity167 ( as @entity160 ) ham it up outside the @entity169 in 1984 ; right , winning the @entity171 award in 1983 from a fan club @entity5 on a march in @entity174 , 1973 protesting against @entity59 proposals to enclose the @entity177 lakes and charge admission within two years of joining the @entity115 in 1969 , mr @entity5 was elected as a councillor in his native @entity180 in south @entity27 before joining the @entity59 in 1974			1
soon notorious as ' @entity48 , he became a bete noire of the @entity62 , supporting everyone from striking miners to @entity66 's leaders at the height of the @entity69 's bombing campaign			0
he famously goaded mrs @entity160 across the @entity187 in @entity188 during the turbulent 1980s by hanging a banner from @entity190 with the unemployment figure on it			0
after she secured revenge by abolishing the @entity59 , he joined the ranks of @entity58 's left wing mps , harrying the @entity108 but also clashing frequently with the @entity58 modernisers			0
the queen and prince @entity198 , with mr @entity5 at the official opening of the @entity187 flood barrier in 1984 when mr @entity114 restored devolved government to the capital - and created the powerful post of mayor - he certainly did not anticipate that it would open the door for his foe 's return			1
but his every attempt to prevent his worst - case scenario backfired - and such was mr @entity5 's popularity that he was forced to ensure he was the official candidate in 2004			1
during that second term , mr @entity5 won widespread praise for the way he stood up for @entity27 after the july 2005 suicide bombings and helped win the @entity215 for the capital			2
there were a string of popular policies too - though tempered by the sorts of personal and professional controversies that have followed him throughout his career			0
comedian @entity223 joins @entity5 to protest against rail fare increases last year in 2005 , he narrowly avoided serious punishment when he likened a @entity227 reporter to a @entity229 concentration camp guard - a theme that also dogged this most recent campaign			2
a close aide was forced to quit over claims he misused public funds and mr @entity5 's unusual private life , involving five children by three partners , was the subject of intense scrutiny			1
despite that - and the dismal opinion poll ratings of @entity242 's unpopular @entity58 government - he may have clung on but for an equally maverick and colourful opponent in @entity8			2
with the roles almost exactly reversed four years on , for some time it looked possible that mr @entity5 could cut short the @entity73 's tenure			1
but his momentum was dramatically arrested by a row over claims he set up his business affairs to avoid paying large sums in income tax - and his refusal to publish accounts in full			0
a bitter personal battle between the two main rivals ensued - one which today 's results demonstrate was won by the incumbent			0
as he contemplates defeat , mr @entity5 will be a spectator rather than a key participant for the @entity215 he helped secure			2
and he looks destined to be a spectator too when the contenders next line up for the race for the mayoralty			0
just do n't expect him to be a quiet one .			0
