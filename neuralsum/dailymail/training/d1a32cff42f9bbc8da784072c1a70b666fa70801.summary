@entity0 , one of the country 's top surgeons , said it was irrelevant who provided treatment for the @entity6 - as long as it was good the growing @entity9 civil war over the @entity6 deepened last night after a former health minister attacked proposals to stop private firms being used to provide treatment			1
@entity0 , one of the country 's top surgeons , said it was irrelevant who provided treatment for the @entity6 - as long as it was good			2
it comes after former health secretary @entity19 said @entity9 's attack on @entity6 competition was a ' fatal mistake ' which could cost it the election			1
@entity25 has pledged to repeal the @entity27 health reforms and slash private sector involvement in the @entity6			2
the @entity9 leader this week claimed he needed to ' rescue the @entity6 ' from the @entity30			2
under @entity9 's plan , private health firms and charities would only be allowed to provide treatment to ' support ' the @entity6 – for example , if there was sudden increase in waiting times			1
shadow health secretary @entity40 has accused the coalition of putting ' an alien ideology at the heart of the @entity6 ' by making the @entity6 put all its services out to the market , allowing private companies to bid for contracts to provide treatment			1
he has refused to say how much he would cut the private sector 's involvement in the @entity6 - but insisted the amount of money spent by the @entity6 on outsourced treatment was too high			2
official figures showed less than 6 per cent of the @entity6 budget is outsourced to private and not - for - profit sectors			1
but of this , more than 4.4 per cent of the @entity6 ' privatisation ' happened under @entity9 – including when mr @entity40 was health secretary			1
speaking to @entity59 last night @entity0 said the @entity6 should prefer providers who delivered the highest quality care - whether they are ' public , private or not - for - profit '			0
he said : ' if the debate does n't focus on the quality of care , then every patient and every clinician will know that the real argument about what matters has already been lost			0
' @entity71 , a former senior policy advisor to ex-prime minister @entity72 , and an architect of many @entity9 health reforms , added that competition within the health service ' seems to work '			0
he said : ' we learnt in the @entity72 government that you have to have pressure from outside if you 're going to reform a poorly performing hospital			0
' that pressure can come from competition			0
it seems to work , it 's a good thing to have and if @entity40 ends up pouring more money into the health service without that , that money is going to be wasted			2
' the @entity6 outsourced 4.4 per cent of its budget under the @entity9 - but less than 2 per cent under the coalition on wednesday , @entity93 accused @entity9 of being ' completely useless ' and accused mr @entity25 of a ' disgraceful ' bid to ' weaponising ' the @entity6 to win votes the @entity9 leader @entity25 said he needed to ' rescue the @entity6 ' from the @entity30 on wednesday , @entity93 accused @entity9 of being ' completely useless ' and accused mr @entity25 of a ' disgraceful ' bid to ' weaponising ' the @entity6 to win votes			1
the prime minister said mr @entity25 was grasping at straws as he is in a ' desperate mess on the @entity6 '			0
overall , the @entity92 has contracted out half as much of the @entity6 budget to the private sector as @entity9 did in power			1
during the four years from 2006/07 , @entity9 outsourced 0.5 per cent of the @entity6 budget every 12 months , while the @entity92 has only contracted out 0.25 per each year			1
mr @entity40 , appearing on @entity59 earlier this week , insisted @entity9 only brought in private sector capacity ' to bring down waiting lists '			0
under @entity9 's planned overhaul of the @entity6 , the @entity6 would be banned from buying in treatment from private health firms before they had tried to do it themselves			2
he said : ' i am clear , the market is not the answer to 21st century health and care			0
if we allow market forces to continue to take hold , they will eventually break the @entity6 apart			0
' the shadow health secretary said the coalition had ' put an alien ideology at the heart of the @entity6 ' by making the @entity6 put all its services out to the market ' @entity9 's @entity40 , appearing on @entity59 last night , insisted @entity9 only brought in private sector capacity ' to bring down waiting lists ' mr @entity40 's proposals were slammed by the @entity130 former health secretary @entity19			1
he said : ' you have got a pale imitation of the 1992 general election campaign , and maybe it will have the same outcome , i do n't know			0
' but it would be a fatal mistake , in my view , for @entity9 to go into this election looking as though it is the party that will better resource the @entity6 but not necessarily put its foot to the floor when it comes to reforming it			0

@entity0 said it did not matter who provided @entity6 treatment if it was good
comes after @entity130 publicly attacked @entity25 over @entity9 's @entity6 plans
@entity19 said @entity25 was failing to drag @entity9 out of ' comfort *zone*
@entity9 has *promised* to end the ' failed @entity155 market *experiment* ' in the @entity6
shadow health secretary @entity40 wants @entity6 ' preferred provider '
official figures show less than 6 ****%**** of the @entity6 budget is outsourced
more than 4.4 ****%**** of the @entity6 was contracted out under @entity9
last @entity9 government outsourced 0.5 ****%**** of the @entity6 budget every year
but the @entity92 has only contracted out 0.25 ****%**** of the budget each year
