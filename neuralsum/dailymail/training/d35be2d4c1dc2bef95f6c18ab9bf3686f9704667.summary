it 's long been the sophisticated woman 's go - to fashion brand and this week @entity3 is finally dipping a toe into the menswear market			1
the high street giant is rolling out its new men 's collection in 24 shops round the country			1
but @entity3 ' first foray into male territory is n't all understated sophistication as one might expect			0
amongst the clean - cut lines and smart separates are a few surprising numbers - most notably this £ 235 crew - neck sweater in fuchsia pink			1
this pink fluffy jumper ( left ) and bright blue stripey number ( right ) are amongst the more surprising elements of the new @entity3 menswear collection if you ca n't imagine your man in it , perhaps whistles ceo @entity26 can persuade you			1
@entity27 , who famously turned @entity28 into a mega brand before joining @entity3 five years ago , told @entity30 of @entity31 , ' the contrast of a fluffy pink jumper on a guy who looks quite hard works			0
' she also added that it 's all about ' looking cool , without looking like an a * * * hole			0
' nevertheless , we ca n't imagine the brand 's most famous fan , the @entity41 , picking this one out for her man			0
left : the fluffy pink number is also available as a fluffy blue number ; right : a casual look from the collection left : this biker jacket retails at £ 395 ; right : ankle - flapper trousers and a backpack for the @entity3 man other items that stand out amongst the otherwise elegant collection include a bright blue and black striped jumper and a camouflage print sweater			1
the more classic pieces , perhaps more likely to make @entity58 's wardrobe , include over-sized coats made from the super-soft wool , simple leather biker jackets and a pair of wool jogging trousers for that casual yet sophisticated look			1
the leather jackets have a £ 395 price tag , knitwear starts at £ 125 and casual separates can be found for under £ 100			2
' at @entity3 we value the power of understatement and believe that sharpness , quality and function are what really resonate today , ' says @entity26 of the new range			0
left : the pink jumper in full fluffy glory ; right : a camouflage style sweater left : double - breasted coat , £ 395 ; right : cashmere joggers for that casual yet elegant look ' menswear is built around a tightly edited core of familiar pieces , so making it feel relevant comes down to perfecting the details and subtly updating them , ' she adds			2
' if the simple things do n’t look brilliant , how can you expect customers to fall for the more standout pieces ? ' @entity26 revealed to the @entity31 that at @entity94 they created a ' dude board ' where they 'd pin pictures of their fantasy @entity3 man			2
the brand describe the collection as ' both accessible and timeless ' but will shoppers agree ? the chosen icons included @entity104 , until they decided he was too romantic , @entity105 and @entity106			1
to help understand what real men wanted from their clothing , @entity3 ran focus groups			0
they discovered that small changing rooms and pockets that are n't big enough for smartphones are prime fashion faux - pas for men			0
but if they find a product they like , she also discovered they 'll go back and buy more of exactly the same thing			0
after all their research , the brand has come up with a collection they describe as ' both accessible and timeless with an emphasis on newness guaranteed to keep men returning each season for exciting , wearable looks '			2
will shoppers agree ? only time will tell			0
let the shopping begin ! the collection includes over-sized jumpers ( left ) and more tailored styles ( right ) left and right : looks from @entity3 inaugral men 's collection includes jackets for under £ 400 and separates for under £ 100			1
