@entity1 's @entity0 recovered from seeing a three - shot lead disappear in the space of two holes to win the @entity5 after a rollercoaster final round on sunday			1
@entity0 made a blistering start at @entity8 , carding four birdies in a row from the third to move into pole position in pursuit of his third @entity14 title			1
the 31 - year - old from @entity16 then three - putted the seventh and ran up a triple - bogey six on the eighth , where he came up short of the green off the tee and saw his first two chips fail to negotiate a steep slope and roll back to his feet			2
@entity25 poses with the @entity5 after winning the event at @entity8 in @entity27 @entity0 reacts after his second shot on the tenth hole during the final round of the @entity5 that left @entity0 two shots off the lead but he battled back superbly with a hat - trick of birdies from the 12th to reclaim the lead on his way to a closing 69 to finish 10 under par , one ahead of @entity41 's @entity40			1
@entity40 chipped in for par on the 15th after duffing his fourth shot just a few feet and birdied the 17th to get within one of @entity0 , but was unable to chip in for another birdie on the 18th to force a play - off			1
six players shared third place on eight under , including @entity51 @entity50 , who had needed to win to move into the world 's top 50 and qualify for the masters			1
@entity56 's @entity55 could also have secured a trip to @entity58 with victory , but finished joint 17th after a closing 69			2
an emotional @entity0 , who had missed the cut in four of his five events this season and withdrew from the other after three rounds due to illness , dedicated the win to his wife @entity68 and brother @entity69			1
@entity0 hits his tee - shot on the first hole during the final round before winning the competition @entity0 ( left ) is presented with his winner 's trophy by @entity77 prince @entity76 of @entity27 ( right ) ' it means a huge amount , ' @entity0 told @entity80 4			1
' my brother has supported me since i was so young			2
this one 's for him and @entity68			2
i know they are all back home and probably going crazy at the moment			0
' i 've gone through some tough times with injury but kept believing and they were at my back and said just go out there and play golf and that 's what i did today			1
it was so much fun out there			0
' asked about his triple bogey on the eighth , the former @entity98 amateur champion added : ' i just did n't execute the shot exactly as i wanted to			0
hit a poor chip , rolled back into a divot , did n't come out , hit it back on , two putts , easy six			0
it 's one of those courses that has so many holes like that			0
' i knew i was still in the mix and walking down nine i was still level par for my round and i knew the back nine was very scoreable			0
i made great putts on nine and 10 just to keep the momentum going and then i stood over a putt on the 12th and felt my putter feels absolutely great			0
' i said to myself just got for it , this is your time and pretty much took it by the scruff of the neck the next two holes			0

@entity0 was *delighted* to win trophy after tough *campaign*
the @entity126 had missed the cut in four of his five events this season
he had to withdraw from the other event through illness
