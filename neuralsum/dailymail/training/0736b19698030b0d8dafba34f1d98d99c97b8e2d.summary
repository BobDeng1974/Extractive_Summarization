countless cyclists have been injured - or even killed - after falling victim to a driver 's blind spot , but a new light could help put an end to this			0
@entity7 projects an icon onto the road , helping to ensure that drivers are aware of an approaching cyclist , even if they can not see them			1
the green image is beamed between 16 and 19ft ( five and six metres ) in front of a cyclist , signalling that a driver should not turn across their path			1
@entity34 - based @entity33 claim that just under 80 per cent of cycle accidents occur when a bicycle is travelling straight and a vehicle manoeuvres into them			1
according to the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , 19,438 @entity39 cyclists were involved in accidents last year - and of those 109 died			0
@entity40 says that the most dangerous hours for cyclists are between 3pm and 6pm as well as 8am and 9am on weekdays			0
however , cycling accidents in the dark are more likely to be fatal			0
around 75 per cent of fatal or serious cyclist accidents occur in urban areas and 75 per cent happen at , or near , a road junction the rechargable @entity49 , they say , works to provide a bigger ' footprint ' on the road for the cyclist			1
the @entity7 also works as a normal white led front light - throwing out more than 300 lumens in its brightest mode			2
simple set - up : the rechargable @entity49 works to provide a bigger ' footprint ' on the road watch out : @entity34 - based @entity33 claim that just under 80 per cent of cycle accidents occur when the bicycle is travelling straight ahead and a vehicle manoeuvres into them works as both a traditional 300 lumen bike light and a warning laser light cost : £ 125 ; $ 200 ; € 125 @entity66 casing : aluminium power : charges using usb cable weight : 6.4oz ( 182g ) waterproof up to 3ft ( 1m ) deep run time : up to 13 hours with and laser both flashing the signature laser image is projected by a separate diode inside the light and can be switched on and off independently			1
its makers explained that the icon is green because the human eye is most receptive to light on that wavelength			0
it also takes relatively little energy to generate green light , resulting in the @entity7 ’s impressive run times - 13 hours with light and laser both flashing			2
the bicycle projection is visible in daylight , but is designed for use in low light when a cyclist would usually use their lights			0
in the @entity39 , this makes up approximately 50 per cent of commuting hours			0
it is available to buy , costing £ 125 in the @entity39 , $ 200 in the @entity99 and € 125 across the rest of @entity101			1
@entity102 : the @entity7 ( pictured ) also works as a normal white @entity104 front light - throwing out more than 300 lumens in its brightest mode making it ideal for use at night			2
