how soon is too soon ? and do you really love someone after three months ? they 're the three most significant words in the @entity5 language			1
deliver them at the right time to the right person and the first time they 're said out loud calls for champagne			1
blurt them out at the wrong time to the wrong person and you need a stiff drink for totally different reasons			1
it 's the ultimate embarrassment			2
why ? because we do n't know what the hell we 'd do if our partner does n't say it back			2
there is only one correct response to ' i love you ' and that 's ' i love you too			1
' so , what if they say , ' that 's nice			2
anyway , as i was saying			2
' ? or look at you with pity and say , ' listen , you 're awfully sweet but			2
' ? timing is everything			2
say ' i love you ' too soon and you not only look desperate , you instantly lose power and dignity			1
leave it too late and you risk missing that magic moment which could launch you both onto the next relationship stage			1
so how do you judge when it 's appropriate to let the cat out of the bag and someone into your heart ? @entity20 says you should wait until you 're bursting to tell someone you love them only you can truly answer that one , but these are some things you might like to think about : make sure you both speak the same language your ' i love you , ' might mean , ' i think this is special , let 's give it a go			1
' his interpretation might be , ' when 's the wedding ? ' if you think your partner will overreact , tack something on the end like , ' do n't panic – i 'm not about to propose			2
i 'm just telling you how i feel			2
' wait until you 're absolutely bursting like , you 'll internally combust if you do n't say it right now			2
you 're 100 per cent convinced you mean it			2
you do n't love someone after three dates when i was 12 , a kid at my school came up to me and delivered a message			1
' see that guy over there ? ' he said , pointing to a kid from my @entity5 class			2
' well , that 's @entity83 and he sent me over here to tell you he loves you and wants to go steady			0
' ' okay , ' i said			0
@entity83 and i went steady for a whole week			0
we did n't speak once though we did sit together outside @entity86 for a full five minutes and looked at our feet			0
true love ? at 12 , yes			1
but if you 're over 18 , i think not			0
telling someone you love them on the second date or second week is ridiculous			1
it 's daft – and that 's what they 'll think you are if you do it			0
to avoid a false reply , @entity20 says you should never say ' i love you ' before or after sex you do n't really love someone after three months the fact is , the first time anyone says , ' i love you , ' they usually don't.not really			1
true love takes years to develop ( take note , @entity2 ) and if you 're lucky , it 's always growing			1
you look back and think , i really thought i loved them when i said it back then but it 's nothing compared to how i feel now			0
that 's not to say you ca n't feel ' in love ' after three months of heavy dating , and it probably is acceptable to trot it out then			1
but for absolute maximum impact , i 'd wait six			0
i know - hard core - but if someone says , ' i love you , ' after you 've dated for six months , they 've thought long and hard about it			1
saying , ' i love you , ' when you 're in the infatuated part of the relationship is easy : you are n't aware of any faults			1
saying it when you 've got a pretty good idea of what you 're letting yourself in for is far more of a compliment			0
an ex of mine told me he loved me for the first time when i stumbled back to bed after throwing up for the sixti ­ eth time that night because of food poisoning			0
call me strange but i was far more complimented than if he 'd said it across the candlelit dinner table earlier that evening , when both of us were tarted up and looking fabulous , totally unaware i was about to swallow a dodgy oyster			0
sneaky ways to say it the coward 's way of saying it first is to say , ' i think i 'm falling in love with you			1
' if they look at you in horror , you can always say , ' do n't panic , i know it 's just casual with us			0
' or , ' that 's why i 've decided to break it off – you do n't feel the same way			1
' another less traumatic option is to pop it at the very , very end of a conversation when you can disappear immediately after saying it			0
like just before you walk through the doors to catch a plane or at the end of a phone call			0
dropping the ' i ' off it also makes it less heavy			0
' love you ' is what you say to your mum			1
again , if they look uncomfortable , you can always add , ' as a friend , of course			0
' if you 're unsure of whether it 's reciprocated , try putting something after it			0
' i love it when you do that ' , ' i love it when we spend time together			1
' ' saying , i love you , when you 're in the infatuated part of the relationship is easy : you are n't aware of any faults ' if they look wide - eyed and gaze at you hopefully , it 's safe to say the big three words solo			1
do n't ask them never ever follow up , ' i love you , ' with , ' do you love me ? ' if they do , they 'll tell you immediately			1
if they do n't , they 're forced to say something like , ' @entity189			0
do n't do it with sex do n't say it just before ( especially before ) or after sex – you wo n't be able to trust their reply			0
some people will say anything to get laid , and if it 's afterward , feel forced to say , ' i do too , ' because they 've just had sex with you , for @entity205 's sake			0
few of us are courageous enough to ravage someone then say , ' actually , it was just the sex i wanted			0
' even if it was , they 'll mumble something appropriate just to be polite			0
