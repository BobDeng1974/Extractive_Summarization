@entity0 would be forgiven for having some concerns that the referee who started the @entity4 ‘ campaign ’ eight weeks ago — when cautioning @entity5 for diving when he was clearly fouled — is taking charge of sunday 's @entity9 final			1
it is @entity13 ’s first @entity12 match since he apologised to @entity12 for that			1
@entity13 wo n’t be concerned as he steps out at @entity16 but , however strong mentally he feels he is , there must be some level of trepidation at how he will react when ( and not if ) @entity12 have a penalty appeal			2
@entity13 ( right ) apologised after wrongly booking @entity5 for diving against @entity21 @entity12 and @entity22 will line up for the @entity9 final at @entity16 on sunday replays show that contact is made with @entity5 as he controls the ball past the oncoming @entity28 @entity5 begins to appeal for a penalty as he hits the turf while @entity28 pleads his innocence the @entity33 midfielder is incredulous after being shown the yellow card in december 's @entity36 clash referees have two ways of dealing with this kind of pressure : they either avoid all contact with any form of the media and go into games unaware and unconcerned by the hype , or they prepare by accepting the pressure that this game brings and work to ensure that they have the coping mechanisms to deal with any ‘ baggage ’ from previous incidents — theirs or those of their colleagues			1
@entity13 is a good referee , sometimes a very good referee			2
mentally he is very strong and has the use of a sports psychologist if he feels the need to refer to him			0
i hope that he is strong enough because @entity4 — the undoubted master of the dark arts — will have his players fully briefed to exploit any weakness			0
he believes that is fair game , particularly when silverware is at stake			0
@entity4 is clearly unhappy with the decision after seeing one of his players booked for simulation			0
