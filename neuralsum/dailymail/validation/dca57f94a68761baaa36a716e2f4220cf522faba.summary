@entity0 is working on an advanced version of its competitor to @entity4 's @entity3 , using research from an artificial intelligence project called ' @entity7			1
' @entity0 has been running its ' personal assistant ' @entity8 on its @entity11 phones for a year , and will put the new version on the desktop with the arrival of @entity11 10 this autumn			1
it has now been revealed @entity8 will be available as a standalone app , usable on phones and tablets powered by @entity4 's @entity21 and @entity23 's @entity22 , people familiar with the project said			1
@entity8 could tell a mobile phone user when to leave for the airport , days after it read an email and realized the user was planning a flight			1
it would automatically check flight status , determine where the phone is located using gps , and checking traffic conditions			0
@entity0 has been running its ' personal assistant ' @entity8 on its @entity11 phones for a year , and will put the new version on the desktop with the arrival of @entity11 10 this autumn			2
' this kind of technology , which can read and understand email , will play a central role in the next roll out of @entity8 , which we are working on now for the fall time frame , ' said @entity51 , managing director of @entity52 and a part of the @entity7 project , in an interview at the company 's @entity57 , @entity58 , headquarters			1
the plan to put @entity8 on machines running software from rivals such as @entity4 and @entity23 , as well as the @entity7 project , have not been reported			1
@entity8 is the name of an artificial intelligence character in the video game series ' @entity68			1
' they represent a new front in ceo @entity72 's battle to sell @entity0 software on any device or platform , rather than trying to force customers to use @entity11			2
success on rivals ' platforms could create new markets and greater relevance for the company best known for its decades - old operating system			0
the concept of ' artificial intelligence ' is broad , and mobile phones and computers already show dexterity with spoken language and sifting through emails for data , for instance			1
still , @entity0 believes its work on speech recognition , search and machine learning will let it transform its digital assistant into the first intelligent ' agent ' which anticipates users needs			0
by comparison , @entity3 is advertised mostly as responding to requests			2
@entity23 's mobile app , which does n't have a name like @entity3 or @entity8 , already offers some limited predictive information ' cards ' based on what it thinks the user wants to know			1
@entity0 has tried to create digital assistants before , without success			0
@entity111 , released in 1995 , was supposed to make using a computer easy , but ended up being the butt of jokes			0
the @entity115 nicknamed ' @entity115 ' suffered a similar fate a few years later			0
' we 're defining the competitive landscape ... of who can provide the most supportive services that make life easier , keep track of things , that complement human memory in a way that helps us get things done , ' said @entity51			0
outside his door stands ' the assistant ' , a monitor showing a woman 's face that can converse with visitors , has access to @entity51 's calendar and can book meetings			2
on his desktop , @entity51 runs ' @entity137 ' , a program that stores everything from appointments to photos and uses machine learning to identify the important moments			0
a keyword search for his university professor instantly brings up photos and video from the last time they met			0
@entity8 could tell a mobile phone user when to leave for the airport , days after it read an email and realized the user was planning a flight			2
it would automatically check flight status , determine where the phone is located using gps , and checking traffic conditions			0
none of the individual steps are a breakthrough , but creating an artificial intelligence that can stitch together the processes marks a breakthrough in usefulness , @entity0 says			1
@entity4 is also pushing @entity3 , which uses @entity0 's @entity169 engine in the background , into new areas with its @entity173 platforms , as well as the recently unveiled @entity174			1
rivals are on the same track			0
@entity23 's latest mobile app uses the predictive power generated from billions of searches to work out what a user is doing , what they are interested in , and sending relevant information , such as when a favorite sports team is playing next			2
@entity4 is also pushing @entity3 , which uses @entity0 's @entity186 search engine in the background , into new areas with its @entity189 and @entity173 platforms , as well as the recently unveiled @entity190			1
the key to @entity8 's success will be knowing where a user is , what time it is , and what they are trying to do			1
@entity7 's work on the relationship between space and time gave rise to @entity0 's secret project name , said @entity51			2
' @entity7 was brilliant about space and time , ' he said			0
' it 's using brilliance about space and time generally in our agents			0
' ( reporting by @entity208 , editing by @entity210 and @entity211 )			0

will compete against @entity213 and @entity4 's @entity3
