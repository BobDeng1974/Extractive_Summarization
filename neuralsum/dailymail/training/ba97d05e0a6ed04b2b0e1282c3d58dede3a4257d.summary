when @entity1 was given the shock news that his three - year - old son @entity3 had developed autism , he did n’t even flinch at the decision to quit his life as a high - flying radio personality to care for him			1
almost immediately the up - and - coming star - who appeared as one - half of a successful @entity11 radio duo , based in @entity12 , in the 1980s alongside @entity13 – made his mind up 15 - years - ago that he and wife @entity15 were going to fight to better their son ’s health			1
their story – which revolves around their eldest son 's battle with autism - is one of thousands untold in the battle to overcome the condition and will be aired on @entity30 ’s @entity29 tonight			1
@entity1 was one - half of a successful @entity11 radio duo , in the 1980s alongside @entity13 ' @entity13 ' ( pictured right ) the @entity12 couple describe how they went from rock bottom sitting in their car after learning of @entity3 's condition , to watching their son graduate school as one of the top of his class this year			1
@entity1 ( pictured right ) gave up his radio career for son @entity3 ( pictured left ) despite some saying he committed ' career suicide ' ‘ we got to one pediatrician and we ’d been to see him a couple of times , ’ mr @entity1 said			1
‘ and on one of the visits – it was just a bit of a throw away , ( the pediatrician said ) ‘ oh , he ’s got autism			0
’ ‘ it was one of those things – it really hit			0
’ he and wife @entity15 remember the day vividly , shattered that a disease they thought they could n’t fix was going to burden their ‘ perfect child ’ for the rest of his life			1
‘ it was raining , ’ @entity15 said , ‘ and @entity3 was sitting in the back of the car oblivious making all those baby sounds and i think for about half an hour we thought it was the end of the earth			1
’ ‘ and then we thought , well , bugger you let ’s see what we can do about this			0
’ prior to the diagnosis , @entity3 was born a healthy boy , the ‘ perfect child ’ his father described him , a quiet , well - behaved toddler who hardly made a peep at night and was a pleasure to take into public			2
but by age three , the @entity102 discovered @entity3 was n’t growing into the same boy many of his peers around him were			2
he was becoming increasingly agitated by sound and light , showed little sign of emotion and displayed no affection			0
@entity3 was in the grip of a relatively unknown disease that changed the @entity1 's life dramatically			1
at three years old , @entity3 ( pictured right ) developed autism			1
prior to the diagnosis , @entity3 was born a healthy boy , the ‘ perfect child ’ his father described him as @entity1 and wife @entity15 ( pictured ) remember the day vividly @entity3 was diagnosed with autism , shattered that a disease they thought they could n’t fix was going to burden their ‘ perfect child ’ for the rest of his life mr @entity1 was enjoying life as a successful media identity having carved out a partnership with @entity11 radio host @entity13 as ' @entity129 ' in the 1980s			1
when he announced he was leaving the industry to care of his son , many coined it ' career suicide ' , but mr @entity1 said the priority of his son 's health was paramount and that was all that mattered			1
he subsequenlty ended his career in top - rating radio shows and a string of national television programs to better his son 's health			1
' it did n't really matter what i did , or what my job was - if something is wrong with your child , you need to fix , ' he said			0
mr @entity1 's story of how he and his wife @entity15 turned @entity3 's life around , after enlisting the professionalism of pioneer autism researcher @entity156 , is remarkable			1
at his worst , @entity3 was hyperactive an inaudible child who could barely speak			2
‘ he would scream and tantrum			0
he was just in his own world , ’ his father said			0
his mother said health professionals had written him off , and that there was little help available			0
but now 18 , @entity3 has taken huge steps in his battle to beat autism , all thanks to his involvement in an early intervention program known as @entity169 ( @entity169 )			2
@entity170 : the @entity1 would n't have done things differently after @entity1 ( pictured middle right ) gave up his radio career to help look after son @entity3 when he developed autism at three years old the turning point in @entity3 ’s life came in 1999 when the @entity102 met ms @entity156 , a speech pathologist and therapist pioneering the treatment which focuses on all areas of development including communication , play , self - help , fine and gross motor as well as academic skills			1
@entity186 ( pictured right ) and @entity188 ( pictured left ) were a popular @entity12 radio team it addressed @entity3 ’s problematic behaviours ' including tantrums , as well as some socially inappropriate behaviours			1
the program also helps children perform basic tasks such as tying shoelaces			0
but for many not as fortunate as @entity3 , the program is simply out of reach			0
ongoing treatment requires a huge financial investment due to a lack of @entity204 - funded support			0
about one in every 100 child ’s family will experience autism and only children whose family can afford treatment make successful progress to beat it			0
mr @entity1 said some people pay upward of of ‘ $ 40,000 a year , ’ for the @entity169 program , but for him it was worth every cent ' i 'm so glad we did ... we 've got such a beautiful child			2
' mrs @entity219 said involvement such as the @entity169 shows what is possible with the help of early intervention for autism			0
' @entity3 's progress shows what is possible , ' mother @entity15 , who is now ceo of @entity227 , said			2
' we know that kids in @entity11 , one in a hundred of them , have @entity232 and the reality is the vast majority are not getting anywhere near best practice guidelines for treatment of @entity232			0
' she said unless the government makes a genuine investment in this area , so many children are not going to reach their best outcome			0
' and i think that 's a tragedy			0
' the @entity11 story : my @entity248 , will air on @entity30 at 8pm tonight .			2
