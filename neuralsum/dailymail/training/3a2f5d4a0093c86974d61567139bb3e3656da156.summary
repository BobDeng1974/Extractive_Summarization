the statement met with cries of outrage from survivors of the @entity8 war packed into the public gallery at the @entity18 war crimes tribunal in the @entity19			1
some wept at what they branded the ‘ cruel , empty ’ words of the man they blame for masterminding the ethnic cleansing of tens of thousands of @entity25 in the 1990s			2
a relaxed - looking @entity2 , 67 , opened his defence by insisting he had done ‘ everything within human power ’ to avoid the war , adding : ‘ instead of being accused of the events in our war , i should be rewarded for all the good things i have done			1
’ @entity2 was arrested in @entity7 in 2008 after 13 years living in disguise as a new age health guru			2
he denies blame for atrocities including the 1995 @entity39 massacre when more than 7,000 @entity41 men and boys were executed			1
@entity2 told judges he was a reluctant player in the break - up of @entity45 , adding that before the war many of his friends were @entity25			1
until his arrest in 2008 , @entity2 had been one of the most wanted men in the world , accused of orchestrating the murders of thousands of @entity41 and @entity52 during a war that ultimately claimed the lives of an estimated 100,000 people between 1992 and 1995			1
he is also being prosecuted for his role in the shelling and 44 - month siege of @entity59 which left 12,000 civilians dead and forced thousands to eat grass to survive , and the use of 284 @entity18 peacekeepers as human shields in may and june 1995			1
@entity78 went on trial this year facing the same charges as supreme commander of the @entity87 armed forces and president of the @entity89 of the @entity90 , prosecutors have claimed @entity2 was ultimately responsible for numerous massacres and war crimes carried out by his army			1
current charges include : @entity2 was acquitted over the following massacres carried out by the @entity90 army after prosecutors failed to provide enough evidence to support claims that he was directly responsible			1
but the former psychologist and poet , told judges he was a ' physician and literary man ' who was a reluctant player in the violent breakup of @entity45			0
he said @entity25 had faked the circumstances of two shellings of a marketplace in the @entity8 capital @entity59 during a siege by @entity7 forces where more than 100 people were killed			1
' @entity59 is my city , and any story that we would shell @entity59 without any reason is untrue , ' he said , reiterating long - standing allegations by the @entity7 side which have already been refuted by the @entity19 tribunal in an earlier case			1
@entity2 said @entity59 was his adopted home and that ' every shell that fell on @entity59 hurt me personally			2
' branding the first market shelling a ' shameless orchestration ' , he added : ' obviously some people got killed by that explosion but we also saw mannequins being thrown onto trucks creating this show for the world			0
' leaning forward in his chair , he emphasised points with jabs of his right hand and paused occasionally to adjust his rimless glasses			0
he said the first marketplace shelling , in february 1994 , in which 68 people were killed and 144 were injured , had been orchestrated , as was a second a few days later			0
prosecutors have painted a starkly different picture of @entity2 during months of witness testimony , portraying him as a political leader who masterminded @entity7 atrocities throughout the war			1
@entity2 , 67 , denied that portrait of him			0
the statement was not made under oath , meaning @entity2 could not be cross-examined by prosecutors but will later be permitted to cross-examine witnesses himself			0
his speech coincided with a historic moment for the tribunal as one of the last of the tribunal 's 161 indicted suspects to face justice as his trial gets under way in a neighbouring courtroom			0
@entity159 , a former leader of rebel @entity160 in @entity52 , was arrested last year in northern @entity7 after more than seven years on the run and pleaded not guilty to charges of murdering hundreds of @entity52 and expelling tens of thousands more			1
but all eyes were on @entity2 today as he tried to dodge claims that he masterminded some of the most horrific wartime atrocities since the @entity167			0

he had been living in disguise as a new age health guru			0

he faces allegations of genocide and crimes against humanity during the conflict that left an estimated 100,000 people dead between 1992 and 1995 the @entity45 war crimes tribunal began trying its last suspect today , opening the final chapter for an institution that has broken new ground in the investigation of conflicts and paved the way for a permanent global war crimes court			1
@entity159 ( pictured ) , the last of 161 suspects still alive and at large after the wars that accompanied the breakup of @entity45 , was arrested last year and is accused of murder , torture and forcible deportation at the very outset of those wars			0
prosecutors say @entity159 , president of the self - proclaimed @entity221 from 1992 - 94 , was responsible for killings and forced deportations of minority ethnic croats from the region after the @entity52 government in @entity227 broke away from @entity45 in 1991			1
already sentenced in his absence to a total of 40 years in prison by @entity52 courts in the mid- 1990s , @entity159 was finally detained by @entity7 authorities in 2011			2
pictures beamed around the world revealed not the flamboyant , bouffant - haired leader of armies but a bedraggled and washed - up pensioner with a bushy white beard down to his chest			2

but he boycotted the start of his trial in october 2009 saying he had not been given enough time to prepare			0
the first witness did not testify until april 2010 and prosecutors rested their case on may 25 this year			0
just over a month later , judges acquitted @entity2 of one count of genocide , saying prosecutors had not presented enough evidence to establish that a campaign of murder and persecution early in the @entity254 amounted to genocide			0
prosecutors have appealed the acquittal			0
@entity2 still faces 10 more charges , including one genocide count relating to the @entity39 massacre			1
@entity2 is one of a trio of architects of the @entity264 wars brought to trial in the @entity19 for wars among the successor countries and the peoples of multi-ethnic @entity45 between 1991 and 1999 , in which well over 100,000 people were killed and millions were displaced			2
his wartime military chief , general @entity78 , went on trial this year , facing the same charges , and former @entity45 and @entity7 president @entity275 died in 2006 before the end of his trial			1
for years it seemed that the main suspects would stay out of the tribunal 's reach , until political changes in the countries of southeastern @entity283 made it ever more difficult for suspects to hide			0
in july , @entity7 announced it was investigating 13 people on suspicion of helping war criminals evade justice			1
grief : a @entity41 woman weeps as she squats next to the grave of her relative in the foggy morning during a memorial ceremony for victims of the @entity39 massacre in 1995 @entity297 task : international forensic experts examine dozens of bodies in a mass grave linked to the @entity39 massacre that left 8,000 @entity25 men and boys dead in a @entity18 - protected enclave both men face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if convicted			1

@entity2 , who was also an enthusiastic player of a single - string @entity7 instrument known as the ' gusle ' , became head of the @entity355 in 1989			2
the flamboyant , bouffant - haired leader showed few signs of the hatred to come			0
he regularly played high - stakes poker with his @entity25 and @entity361 neighbours			2

he said : ' instead of being accused , i should have been rewarded for all the good things i have done '

they include his role in the massacre of 8,000 @entity25 men and boys from @entity39 in july 1995 and the shelling and siege of @entity59
his claims drew *snorts* of *derision* and *catcalls* of , ' he 's lying ! he 's lying ! ' from @entity25 survivors of the war watching from public gallery
