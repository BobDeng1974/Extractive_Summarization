a recent survey has revealed that more than a third of @entity2 take four or fewer baths a year — preferring instead to opt for the convenience of a shower			1
more fool them , i say			2
i ’m part of the @entity9 school of thinking — the fashion designer has been reported to take up to five baths a day , revering them for their ‘ meditative ’ properties			1
when it comes to relaxation , nothing beats a long , hot soak			1
these days , you can make your bath even more self - indulgent with gadgets that let you lounge in the tub while watching films , reading books or listening to music			1
and some of them will even run the water for you			0
i slipped beneath the suds to try them out			0
@entity30 the @entity32 @entity31 lounge in utmost comfort with a bath pillow from one of the world ’s swankiest hotels — the @entity38 ( £ 15 , @entity39 )			1
while a night at @entity32 will cost you the best part of £ 400 , one of their bath pillows — described to me by one travel editor as ‘ the best i ’ve found anywhere , ever ’ — can be yours for a fraction of the cost			1
unlike its cheaper cousins , this luxurious pillow is not inflatable or square			0
instead , it ’s a foam cylinder , covered in spa - style waffle cotton , which can be removed for washing			1
two suction cups on a flap of fabric hold it firmly against the bath , and the cylinder sits at the nape of your neck , cradling you gently as you drift off			1
keep a glass of @entity67 @entity68 relaxing with a glass of red by candlelight sounds like a dream — until you knock it onto the floor or into the bath			1
to avoid such mishaps , look for holders , such as the @entity68 ( £ 6.95 , homearama.co.uk ) , a sleek , stainless - steel design that works best on a perpendicular bath side			1
they also do a tealight holder ( £ 6.45 )			0
for an all - in - one solution that will hold not only a glass of wine and a candle , but also a book , check out the @entity88 with @entity89 ( £ 14.99 , @entity90 )			1
it may look a little twee , but it does the job so well , you ’re unlikely to care			0
extending handles mean that it will fit over any bath up to 90 cm wide ( a standard bath is 70 cm ) and the candle holder , book stand and wine glass holders are all detachable			1
@entity101 colour changing spa lights if candles do n’t light your fire , there ’s a wealth of other lighting options to try out at bathtime			0
colour @entity111 ( £ 6.95 , prezzybox.com ) are fully submersible and come with a suction cup , which means they can stick to the sides and the base of the bath			1
they change colour gradually and will even float on the surface			0
for a real @entity122 effect , try the @entity123 ( £ 7.99 , firebox.com ) , a floating gadget that projects multicoloured patterns of light around your bathroom — rather like a watery mirrorball			0
it sounds bonkers but , with the lights off , it ’s truly mesmerising			0
have a rave while you bathe the @entity136 speaker if you enjoy being lulled by @entity139 ’s @entity138 while you bathe , then a waterproof speaker is a must			0
the best solution is a @entity136 speaker that connects wirelessly to your computer , tablet or smartphone , meaning your pricey gadgets can stay safe and dry outside the bathroom , while you listen to your music inside			0
the @entity149 ( £ 6.15 , @entity90 ) has a suction cup attached , so you can stick it to tiles			0
it does n’t offer the best quality sound — what do you expect at that price ? — and for best results , you need to turn the volume right up on the source device , then adjust on the speaker			0
but it ’s rechargeable and does everything that you need it to , including skipping tracks			0
you can even use it to answer your phone			0
that is if you do n’t mind your bath being disturbed			1
for a better sound experience , though at a significantly elevated price , try the rechargeable waterproof @entity170 ( £ 249.95 , @entity90 )			0
only about the size of two stacked tin cans , it produces seriously impressive sound			0
and if you really love your music , you might consider an upgrade to the @entity177 ( £ 396.25 , ukbathrooms.com ) , which turns your whole bath into a speaker that wirelessly connects to the music source using @entity136			1
the sounds are n’t just audible , they can actually be felt as vibrations through the water — fine if you ’re listening to waves or whales , though less relaxing if you have a penchant for heavy metal ! @entity189 @entity192 ’s nuud @entity191 case back in the old days , reading a book or magazine in the bath was the ultimate escape — until , of course , you dropped it in the water and had to leave it splayed on a radiator to dry			1
now that an estimated two in five of us own a tablet or @entity207 , the ramifications of dropping your novel in the bath have become a little more significant			2
so , although the @entity209 ( £ 139.95 , johnlewis.com ) is £ 60 more than the basic model and around £ 80 more than the cheapest @entity211 , it might be a worthwhile investment , because it ’s waterproof for up to 30 minutes			0
if you ’d rather watch television in the bath , you could either splash out on a @entity215 ( from £ 470 , hafele.co.uk ) or invest in a waterproof case and stream films or tv through your tablet			2
@entity192 ’s nuud @entity191 case ( £ 89.95 , apple.com ) does the job , but comes at a price			0
if you ’re just planning on leaving your device on the side , then a water - resistant one ( which is splash - proof , but not submersible ) , such as the @entity227 ( from £ 19.99 , @entity90 ) , which comes with its own stand , will do			2
an even cheaper option is a @entity230 ( from £ 5.09 , @entity90 ) — effectively a heavy - duty plastic bag , which uses a @entity233 closure to keep the water away from your gadget if it accidentally gets dunked			2
... and the @entity236 ! @entity237 if you dream of having a butler to draw a bath for you , then this gadget could make all of your @entity242 fantasies come true			1
@entity237 ( from £ 499 , crosswater.co.uk ) is a seriously high - tech bath system that lets you take control of your bath or shower from an app on your smartphone			1
you can dial in the temperature and depth you want — and even store up to three presets , just in case you prefer a hotter or deeper bath than your partner			2
you ’ll need to be on the same wifi network ( so you ca n’t start running the bath when you ’re on the train on the way home ) , but it can be used from anywhere in the house			2
and if you ’ve got the additional electronic plug system , you can even drain the bath using the app , too			2
unfortunately , the one thing it wo n’t do is to clean the bath for you !			2
