@entity0 will receive a hammer blow on monday , the morning after their flagship @entity4 show , with news they have lost @entity6 highlights rights to @entity8			1
the @entity6 are due to announce a three - year deal with @entity10 for all their divisions plus the @entity12 , starting next season			1
@entity10 won the contract with an estimated offer of £ 2million a year , which was marginally better than the @entity0 ’s , and a pledge to screen their show at 9pm on saturday			1
the @entity0 will receive a hammer blow with news they have lost @entity6 highlights rights to @entity8 @entity10 won the bidding with a contract of £ 2million a year ( pictured @entity23 scoring for @entity24 ) @entity25 may be limited to @entity27 highlights this was seen by the @entity6 as a far better way to promote their product than being put in the graveyard slot after @entity25 , even if there is more cache in having the @entity35 as rights - holders			1
and certainly saturday prime - time for the @entity6 will not bring the derogatory chants of ‘ thursday nights , @entity8 ’ that greeted teams dropping out of the @entity40 into the @entity10 - screened @entity41			1
meanwhile , the nightmare scenario facing the @entity0 is that the loss of their @entity6 contract will be followed next february with @entity45 outbidding them for their prized @entity47 highlights			1
that is the likely outcome , with @entity45 having money to spend on football after losing the @entity40 and the @entity27 , but not enough for live @entity47 packages			2
@entity52 would then be left with only the @entity27 and the major tournaments they share with @entity45			2
@entity54 showed its great pulling power on sunday night when @entity57 skeleton champion @entity56 , one of the 10 athletes short - listed for the top prize , made a three - flight journey from @entity61 in the @entity62 to be in @entity63 , despite her slim chance of winning			1
other awards ceremonies struggle to attract sports stars across @entity67 unless they have been guaranteed a gong			0
@entity56 made a three - flight journey from @entity61 , @entity62 , to make the @entity71 awards @entity77 leading the @entity79 counter to @entity80 ’s £ 200m state - of - the art training centre , saying academies are about people rather than buildings , is n’t necessarily supported by his brother and class of 92 team - mate @entity84 he sent his son to the @entity80 academy before the grand opening , as did @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity79 ambassador @entity90			1
bearing in mind how paranoid @entity92 are about the challenge from @entity96 , and @entity98 staff going off message on social media , @entity92 reporter @entity91 might find himself in trouble even for tweeting : ‘ happy to hear @entity103 v @entity101 will be televised			0
great news for the @entity106 club			0
’ @entity96 are broadcasting the match			0
@entity108 sent his son to the @entity80 academy before the grand opening of their £ 200m training centre the @entity114 blame game international athletics chiefs have only themselves to blame for the list of 150 competitors with suspicious blood readings from 2006 - 08 — which includes a famous @entity120 — continuing to be a major talking point			2
the document , seen by @entity123 , is simply a list of names and was being shown to media attending the @entity127 by @entity129 tv station @entity128			0
so @entity114 communications chief @entity130 , rather than moan about the reporting three days later , should have been briefing journalists in @entity133 as to why the list in isolation is a long way from doping evidence			0
the saga has also deflected attention from the more serious allegations on @entity129 tv about a systematic doping regime in @entity143			0
@entity144 dates for @entity145 will be discussed at the @entity147 meeting in @entity148 this week			0
november and december , despite @entity47 opposition , now looks the only viable option			2
january - february — suggested by @entity147 ’s task force — will not happen			0
@entity127 president @entity152 was adamant at the @entity127 that @entity147 president @entity153 had promised the @entity144 would not interfere with the @entity154			0
with all the scrutiny on top referees , it seemed odd that @entity159 technical director @entity158 was sent to referee an under 12 tournament in @entity161 as part of the @entity164 anniversary events rather than keep a close eye on the weekend ’s @entity47 performances			1
a @entity47 spokesman said @entity158 was their ambassador at the event			2
@entity158 officiated at the under 12 tournament in @entity161 over the weekend			1

@entity6 due to announce three - year deal with @entity8
@entity10 won the contract with estimated offer of £ 2million a year
nightmare for @entity0 is if they lose @entity47 rights to @entity45 too
@entity56 made long flight to @entity71 awards from @entity61
@entity158 officiated at @entity161 under 12 tournament over the weekend
