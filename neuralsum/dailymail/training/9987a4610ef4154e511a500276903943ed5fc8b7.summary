by @entity0 and @entity1 told she had cancer and then only a few weeks later that she was pregnant , @entity2 faced an agonising choice			1
she could have immediate treatment and lose her child – or delay surgery until birth and risk the disease spreading			1
so instead @entity10 took a third option : a high - risk operation that is thought not to have been tried in @entity13 before			1
worry : @entity2 , 27 , feared she might never meet her son @entity14 after being diagnosed with cervical cancer while pregnant with him it worked and yesterday she was preparing for the first birthday of @entity14 , the child she thought she would never see			1
‘ it ’s been such a tough time , but to have such a special , happy baby today is the best possible reward for everything we went through , ’ said the 27 - year - old			1
‘ every time he smiles , it feels like he ’s summing up our whole experience over the past 12 months and telling us everything ’s going to be fine now			0
’ the barmaid was given the shattering news she had cancerous cells after her very first cervical screening test in may 2012			0
she was referred for surgery at the @entity37 in @entity38 which , a month later , told her she was pregnant			2
it was then that doctors offered her the third option – trying to remove her cervix while not harming the unborn child			0
‘ they told me the operation had n’t even been done in this country before , ’ said @entity10 , who also has a seven - year - old son			2
decisions : mrs @entity2 faced two impossible options - to abort her baby and then have a life - saving operation to remove her cervix , or delay surgery until the baby was born and risk the cancer spreading relief : but the pionnering option she went for involved a high - risk operation during pregnancy without aborting her child			1
mrs @entity2 is believed to be the first woman in @entity13 to have the life - saving operation while pregnant mrs @entity2 said : ¿ it was an easy decision for me to make ¿ as far as i was concerned , i was just leaving it to fate to as to whether the baby survived or not ' but the alternatives were losing the baby and knowing i might not be able to get pregnant again , or waiting until after he was born when it might have spread			1
‘ it was an easy decision for me to make – as far as i was concerned , i was just leaving it to fate to as to whether the baby survived or not			2
’ to give @entity14 the best chance of survival , the operation at @entity75 in @entity38 was delayed until 11 weeks into her pregnancy			2
surgeons removed the cancerous cervix and rebuilt it using surrounding tissue			0
the extremely delicate procedure – normally undertaken only on women who are not pregnant but who want to be able to have a child – enables the foetus to remain in the womb			0
although @entity14 grew normally , @entity10 , from @entity87 , became convinced the worst would happen			0
‘ i understood that even if the baby survived the initial operation , it would still be a high - risk pregnancy , ’ she said yesterday			1
mrs @entity2 said : ' in order to cope , i worked on coming to terms with the scenario that i would have no baby at the end of this ordeal so i did n't have to grieve for it if the worst happened			2
it was extremely difficult for me and my whole family ' miracle : @entity102 was sucessfully delivered by caesarean section , weighing a healthy 7lb 2oz birthday boy : @entity14 will celebrate his first birthday next week , with a party at @entity75 's @entity107 and @entity108 ‘ in order to cope i worked on coming to terms with the scenario that i would have no baby at the end of this ordeal so i did n’t have to grieve for it if the worst happened			1
it was extremely difficult for me and my whole family			0
‘ as the pregnancy went on i began to accept i needed to buy some baby things , but there was no excitement in it			0
i left everything at other people ’s houses so there was nothing in my home			0
as the weeks went by and the chances of my baby actually surviving improved , i still could not allow myself to believe everything would be all right			0
’ @entity14 was successfully delivered by caesarean section , weighing a healthy 7lb 2oz			1
‘ only when i heard him cry did i allow myself to hope that everything was going to be ok , ’ added @entity10			0
delight : celebrating @entity14 's first birthday was a day the @entity138 family never believed would come ‘ but straight away it was as if the past 12 months had n’t happened – he ’s been absolutely brilliant			0
’ miss @entity2 and @entity140 , her shop manager partner , will next week celebrate @entity14 ’s birthday with a party at @entity75 ’s @entity145 information and support centre			1
@entity147 , the @entity145 nurse who cared for @entity2 , said : ‘ we believe this is the first time this operation has been performed on a pregnant woman in this country			1
‘ @entity2 had a whole team around her to ensure the risks were minimised and her baby was given the best chance of survival			2
’ miss @entity2 is supporting @entity159 ’s campaign to ensure no one faces cancer alone			2
