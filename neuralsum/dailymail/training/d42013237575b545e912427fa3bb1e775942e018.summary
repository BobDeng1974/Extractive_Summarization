the number of @entity2 migrants registering to work in @entity4 has soared by 55 per cent since 2010 , but @entity5 has been warned a plan to cap the numbers would be illegal			1
in the last year , national insurance numbers ( @entity8 ) have been handed out to more than 420,000 people from the @entity2 , up from 285,000 in the year before the coalition was formed			1
@entity11 is considering a plan to impose a limit on the numbers available to workers from individual countries , but today there were fresh warnings the idea would break @entity21 law			1
the prime minister has promised it will form the centrepiece of his plan to renegotiate @entity4 's membership of the @entity2 , before holding an in - out referendum by 2017			1
senior conservatives are considering a proposal to impose quote on ' time - limited national insurance numbers ' to limit the numbers of people able to move to @entity4 for work			1
mr @entity5 promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands , but the figure has topped 200,000 after a surge in the numbers using freedom of movement laws to move from elsewhere in the @entity2			1
latest figures show that since 2010 the number of @entity2 workers registering for a national insurance number ( @entity8 ) has risen by 55 per cent , while for those outside the @entity2 the figure has fallen by 48 per cent to 420,000			1
the biggest increases in the last four years are from @entity24 ( up 272 per cent ) , @entity26 ( 244 per cent ) , @entity25 ( 172 per cent ) , @entity27 ( 151 per cent ) , @entity67 ( 137 per cent ) and @entity68 ( 112 per cent )			0
a senior @entity71 minister told @entity72 : ' the problem is n't just the new countries like @entity24 and @entity75 , it is people coming from countries like @entity25 , @entity27 and @entity26 because they ca n't get work at home			2
' we need to be able to show that we can do something about that			0
' today mr @entity5 said : '' what we need in @entity4 is a renegotiation of our relationship with the @entity2 and a referendum where the @entity4 people decide whether to stay in this reformed organisation or do we leave it			1
' now that 's what i will pursue , that 's what i will deliver and at the heart of that renegotiation we need to address people 's concerns about immigration			0
' i 'm very clear about who the boss is , about who i answer to and it is the @entity4 people			1
they want this issue fixed , they 're not being unreasonable about it			0
' the most nino handed out last year were to @entity110 , @entity24 and @entity25 , the data reveals the biggest increases have been from @entity2 countries , with controls on immigration from other countries leading to drops in @entity8 registrations home secretary @entity118 is already in talks with the @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 governments about tackling immigration across the @entity2			1
@entity124 insists mr @entity5 will set out his plans in ' due course '			0
the pm 's official spokesman said today : ' if you look at countries around @entity21 , governments are looking at the impact of immigration			2
' the prime minister has for some time raised his concerns			1
freedom of movement can not be an unqualified principle of the @entity2			2
' do we need change ? clearly we do			0
we believe that there will be treaty change			0
' however , the idea of imposing quotes on the number of people moving to @entity4 from elsewhere in the @entity2 has been roundly criticised			1
outgoing @entity147 president @entity146 yesterday warned restricting migrant numbers would ' not be in conformity with @entity21 laws '			1
@entity152 dem business secretary @entity151 told @entity153 's today programme : ' it almost definitely is illegal , but there is a bigger issue of principle			1
' it was @entity4 that promoted the single market in @entity21			2
it was @entity162 biggest negotiating achievement			0
' there 're roughly the same amount of @entity4 people who leave and go to the rest of @entity21 as come here , and the ones who come here are overwhelmingly younger people , workers , and people who make a net positive contribution to the @entity4 budget			1
' @entity174 , secretary of state for european affairs in the @entity67 government , also said attempts to limit people from across the @entity2 moving to @entity4 by capping the number of national insurance numbers for foreign workers would be illegal			1
he told @entity153 's today programme : ' yes , it seems that it goes not only against the directive that we have but against the treaty			0
why ? because it is limiting the numbers in absolute terms and that is not allowed			0
' @entity71 mp @entity191 also said the plan would break existing @entity2 law , but suggested it would still be a good idea			2
he added : ' i very much welcome people like @entity196 and the prime minister less explicitly saying that we do need to move to a quota system for @entity2 migrants , simply because when we first joined the @entity203 , as they were then , there were two fundamental differences			1
' first of all , the free movement principle was very undeveloped and we only had eight countries in the @entity2			2
' mr @entity191 said he could not see ' any other way that we can obtain the new relationship the prime minister wants us to have ' without taking such action or quitting the @entity2			1
@entity211 , @entity212 deputy director - general , said : ' businesses recognise that free movement of workers within the @entity2 is a sensitive issue but are clear that it is an essential part of the single market			0
' it boosts the attraction of investing in the @entity4 , creates jobs and offers firms here real benefits in working with our biggest trading partners			0
' @entity226 leader @entity225 accused mr @entity5 of deceiving voters with his promise to reform the @entity4 's relationship with the @entity2			2
@entity226 leader @entity225 , pictured today on a visit to the @entity231 in @entity232 , accuse mr @entity5 of deceiving voters speaking during a visit to the @entity231 in @entity232 , mr @entity225 said : ' mr @entity5 has been saying to people ' we can have our cake and eat it '			0
he 's actually been deceiving the @entity4 public			0
' he continued : ' what is a fact is you can not do what mr @entity5 is pretending to do and remain a member of the @entity2			0
' i think we 're looking at a man who is desperate to save his own skin , who knows that if he loses the @entity248 by - election to @entity226 there may well be 46 backbenchers who put in letters demanding a leadership election and desperate people do desperate things			0
he 's thrown the rule book out of the window , he 's thrown the fact that actually he 's supported free movement of people his whole political career , that 's gone too , and this is just about survival but it 's not going to work because what he 's said is not true			0
' mr @entity225 said : ' mr @entity146 was absolutely right and his successor mr @entity263 will say the same thing			0
' it is one of the fundamental cornerstones of the @entity2 that you have the free movement of people			2
now the error was letting in 10 former communist countries , countries in which case millions of people are very , very poor and they see the @entity4 as a good place to come to			2
' i do n't blame them for doing it but the truth is you ca n't change that without completely changing the treaty			0
in fact , the reality is the only way to get back your border control from @entity36 is to leave the @entity2 and have a simple trade deal instead			2

prime minister insists the @entity4 people are ' the boss ' not @entity36
