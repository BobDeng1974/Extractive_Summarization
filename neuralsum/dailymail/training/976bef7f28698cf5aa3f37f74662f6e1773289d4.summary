the breathtaking rise to prominence of @entity2 appears set to continue after @entity4 ’s chief executive @entity3 left the club on wednesday			1
@entity3 has agreed to move on amicable terms after a decade at @entity7 , including serving the last five years as chief executive			1
he has been focused almost entirely on the commercial aspects of the role in the recent past and the quest to meet @entity14 ’s @entity13 targets , cut losses and improve the club ’s image on a global scale			0
@entity2 with @entity20 in 2010 and the @entity22 trophy , @entity23 and @entity24 @entity25 ( left ) with @entity20 ( and his son @entity26 ) , @entity26 ( second right ) and @entity28 a smiling @entity2 , @entity30 's former @entity29 who is set to hold much more power at @entity4 ' @entity4 announces that @entity3 , after 10 successful years at the club including five as chief executive , is leaving @entity4 in order to pursue new business opportunities			1
' the club , and in particular the owner ( @entity30 ) and directors , wish to thank @entity3 for his many years of service to @entity4 and support his desire to seek new challenges			1
' @entity3 's efforts have helped the club to achieve its position as one of the leading football clubs in the world			2
' pending additional appointments , chairman @entity49 and director @entity50 will assume additional executive responsibilities			0
' during this time @entity25 , 39 , a @entity52 and @entity53 national , has gradually emerged as the most influential figure in the executive tier of the club and the voice of owner @entity30 on the ground			1
she is trusted implicitly by @entity30 , having advised him and his companies for 17 years since graduating from @entity61			2
as @entity3 started to turn his attention towards the commercial end of the business , @entity25 became the pivotal figure in transfer and contract negotiations and a far more familiar face around @entity7			1
she was central to @entity71 ’s return from @entity72 and to big - money transfers such as @entity75 ’s £ 32million move from @entity76			2
her style is perhaps best described as polite but firm , although there are stories that it went a little further than that during @entity84 ’s contract talks			0
@entity3 has worked at @entity4 for 10 years , including five as chief executive @entity25 was often visible on the ground in @entity87 as links with @entity89 were strengthened and a new training complex was built , although she is rarely seen in @entity91 now and the links between the clubs are no longer quite so strong			1
over recent years , any agents turning up to meetings at the bridge or @entity4 ’s training ground in @entity98 would find @entity25 driving the meetings , increasingly active and influential at the heart of the club with a good relationship with technical director @entity28			1
last year , her rise to power was made official when she was confirmed on the board of both the football club and the plc. in the short term , @entity3 ’s responsibilities will be shared between @entity2 and chairman @entity49 , and in the longer term , the club may consider employing a commercial specialist to replace @entity3 , rather than a traditional ceo			0
@entity113 , pictured celebrating against @entity114 earlier this season , wields the most power at @entity4 @entity3 ( left ) pictured with @entity4 chairman @entity49 , who will assume additional responsibilities ' it has been a privilege to have played a role in the club 's considerable achievements both on and off the pitch over the last 10 years , but i feel the time is right to move on to other challenges			1
' i would like to thank mr @entity30 , the directors , the manager and players and all the staff for their support during my time at the club , and wish them much continued success in the future			0
' @entity3 ’s announcement came without warning , although it emerged that plans had been unfolding for some time			0
the @entity138 watched @entity4 ’s 6 - 0 win in the @entity140 on tuesday before attending a @entity14 meeting and sharing a drink with colleagues			0
he was at the bridge on wednesday tidying up loose ends , but leaves with immediate effect ‘ in order to pursue new business opportunities ’ , according to a statement released by @entity4			1
‘ the club , and in particular the owner and directors , wish to thank @entity3 for his many years of service to @entity4 and support his desire to seek new challenges , ’ the statement added			1
‘ @entity3 ’s efforts have helped the club to achieve its position as one of the leading football clubs in the world			0
’ the @entity4 chief executive pictured with former @entity163 manager @entity162 at @entity7 he took over in september 2009 , stepping up from his role as chief operating officer to replace @entity166 , with whom he had also worked at @entity167			2
among his first tasks was an attempt to secure naming rights for @entity7 , which went down terribly with @entity4 fans and never came to fruition			0
on a more positive note , the team won the @entity140 on his watch , and recorded a small profit in 2012 — perhaps an even more remarkable achievement , all things considered			0
he did manage to increase revenue from sponsorship deals such as those with adidas , @entity181 and @entity182 , while wrestling with the problem posed by the 42,000 capacity at the ground and complications involved in expanding or finding a suitable site for a new home			0
‘ it has been a privilege to have played a role in the club ’s considerable achievements both on and off the pitch over the last 10 years , but i feel the time is right to move on to other challenges , ’ said @entity3 in a statement			2
‘ i would like to thank mr @entity30 , the directors , the manager and players and all the staff for their support during my time at the club , and wish them much continued success in the future			0
