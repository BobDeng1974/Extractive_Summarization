climate change and high rates of extinctions of animals and plants are pushing the @entity9 into a ' danger zone ' for humanity , a scientific report card about mankind 's impact on nature has concluded			1
an international team of 18 experts , expanding on a 2009 report about ' planetary boundaries ' for safe human use , also sounded the alarm about clearance of forests and pollution from nitrogen and phosphorus in fertilisers			1
the research charts the ' @entity25 ' in human activity from the start of the industrial revolution in 1750 to 2010 , and the subsequent changes in the @entity9 system - greenhouse gas levels , ocean acidification , deforestation and biodiversity deterioration			1

twelve indicators depict human activity , for example , economic growth ( gdp ) , population , foreign direct investment , energy consumption , telecommunications , transportation and water use			1
twelve indicators show changes in major environmental components of the @entity57 , for example , the carbon cycle , nitrogen cycle and biodiversity			2
' it is difficult to overestimate the scale and speed of change			2
in a single lifetime humanity has become a planetary - scale geological force , ' says lead author professor @entity68 , who led the joint project between the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) and the @entity71			0
' i do n't think we 've broken the planet but we are creating a much more difficult world , ' @entity72 , one of the authors , told @entity78			0
' four boundaries are assessed to have been crossed , placing humanity in a danger zone , ' a statement said of the study in the journal @entity85 , pointing to climate change , species loss , land - use change and fertiliser pollution			1
of a total of nine boundaries assessed , freshwater use , ocean acidification and ozone depletion were judged to be within safe limits			0
others , including levels of airborne pollution , were yet to be properly assessed			2
the report defined climate change and loss of species as two core areas of concern			1
each ' has the potential on its own to drive the @entity57 into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed , ' the authors wrote			0
rising concentrations of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas , are about 397 parts per million in the atmosphere , above 350 ppm that the study set as the boundary for safe use			0
' when we first aggregated these datasets , we expected to see major changes but what surprised us was the timing			0
researchers also sounded the alarm about clearance of forests and pollution from nitrogen and phosphorus in fertilisers ' almost all graphs show the same pattern			1
' the most dramatic shifts have occurred since 1950			0
' we can say that around 1950 was the start of the @entity25 , ' said professor @entity68 , a researcher at the @entity134 and the @entity71			1
' after 1950 you can see that major @entity57 changes became directly linked to changes largely related to the global economic system			0
' this is a new phenomenon and indicates that humanity has a new responsibility at a global level for the planet , ' he added			0
almost 200 governments will meet in @entity145 in late 2015 to try to agree a deal to limit global warming to avert floods , droughts , heatwaves and rising sea levels blamed on rising emissions of greenhouse gases			0
the study said that rates of extinctions of animals and plants , caused by factors ranging from pollution to deforestation , were 10 to 100 times higher than safe levels			2
' transgressing a boundary increases the risk that human activities could inadvertently drive the @entity57 into a much less hospitable state , ' said lead author @entity68 , of the @entity71 and the @entity134 , @entity169			2
the report expanded definitions of the planetary boundaries set in 2009 , making it hard to compare trends .			0
