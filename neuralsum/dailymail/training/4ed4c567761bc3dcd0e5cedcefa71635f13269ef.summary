a hero to most of his men , @entity1 flew with @entity57 ahead of the @entity59 evacuation the images are a far cry from the better known pictures of the rambunctious @entity1 , who would later retire from the @entity10 as a @entity64 and shot down 20 enemy aircraft during the war			1
he achieved national celebrity after the publication of @entity70 ’s book @entity68 , which was turned into a 1956 feature film starring @entity73 as @entity1			1
@entity1 , who died aged 72 in 1982 , lost his legs in 1931 and left the air force at @entity37 having been told he would never fly again			1
but he returned in 1940 to fly spitfires with @entity77			0
he said : ‘ the fact that i left the @entity10 at @entity37 and i came back into it at @entity37 , through the same bloody gate , is what comes to mind			0
’ a hero to most of his men , @entity1 flew with @entity57 ahead of the @entity59 evacuation			1
he was then sent to command @entity83 , a @entity16 unit that had suffered heavy casualties in the @entity85			0
@entity1 rapidly won his jaded aircrew over with a display of daring aerobatics at their base at @entity90 near @entity91			2

flight sergeant @entity123 – who was nicknamed ‘ @entity127 ’ by @entity1 after he rebuked the legless pilot for making too much noise taking his artificial limbs off – described his former colleague on @entity77 as ‘ outstanding ’			2
‘ he inspired you , ’ @entity123 said , ‘ he was not just two tin legs			0
’ but the comments of another former @entity37 pilot shed some light on @entity1 ’s sometimes controversial personality			2
‘ he was not everybody ’s cup of tea , ’ said @entity136			0

@entity1 flew both in the war a former technician describes how @entity1 shouted at him for daring to step on to the wing of his aircraft with muddy boots on			1
he was knighted in 1976 for his work with disabled people through the @entity150 @entity1 was forced to bail out of his spitfire over @entity152 in 1941 while leading another wing based at @entity154 in @entity155 and became a prisoner of war			2

@entity1 promptly tried to escape			0
@entity165 , head of interpretations and collections at @entity37 , said @entity1 was an ‘ incredible character as a man ’			0
‘ his story still grips people today			0
opinions about him range from heroic individual to a difficult man , ’ he added			0
‘ as a combat leader he was a controversial figure within the @entity10 both as a personality and in terms of his ideas about air fighting			0
’ @entity1 was a proponent of the ‘ @entity181 ’ , a huge formation of aircraft involving several squadrons of fighters which he believe should be sent aloft en masse from 12 group aerodromes north of @entity99 to shoot down enemy bombers with a knockout blow			1
this was at odds with the tactics employed by the @entity194 , led by sir @entity195 , and which covered south east @entity197 and was the immediate line of defence against aerial attackers			0
the debate over the @entity181 tactics persists to this day			0
he was knighted in 1976 for his work with disabled people through the @entity150			0
