@entity1 champions @entity0 were stunned by a vibrant @entity3 side who scored three goals in the first 13 minutes			1
@entity6 came flying out of the blocks at the @entity8 and made @entity9 's @entity0 , which had been so disciplined in their defeat of @entity11 in midweek , look like lambs to the slaughter			1
perhaps that crunching battle against the @entity16 giants had drained them , for they were all at sea here			0
@entity9 , who has only recently returned to the touchline from his suspension , was helpless to do anything as his usually well - organised back - line crumbled to pieces			2
@entity32 was the chief culprit , with the @entity35 centre - back heading the ball past his goalkeeper from about 12 yards out			2
@entity38 had pinged a long ball into the box and @entity41 , once of @entity3 himself , rushed out to catch it			0
but @entity32 was not paying attention and , despite being under no pressure , reached it first and nodded the ball out of @entity41 's reach and into the net			2
there was no quarter given as @entity0 's @entity49 is tackled by @entity3 's @entity50 @entity3 goalkeeper @entity51 is brought into action on a brilliant afternoon for his side @entity3 boss @entity54 celebrates with his players after an excellent victory over @entity0 just one minute later , the lead had been doubled			1
perhaps @entity32 was shell - shocked , but he did nothing to prevent @entity60 slicing through the defence and drilling the ball inside the near post			1
despite his lack of pressure it was still a brilliant goal by @entity3 , with @entity68 's cute flick allowing @entity60 to use his momentum and burst into the box			1
so far , so bad for @entity0			0
as they fought to regain their stability , the conceded again and this time from a set piece			0
@entity3 : @entity51 ; @entity73 , @entity38 , @entity74 , @entity75 ; @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity60 ( @entity78 71 ) ; @entity79 , @entity68 ( @entity80 75 ) , @entity81 ( @entity82 63 ) goals : @entity32 ( o.g.6 ) , @entity60 ( 7 ) , @entity74 ( 13 ) booked : @entity60 , @entity77 , @entity84 , @entity75 @entity0 : @entity41 ; @entity85 , @entity32 , @entity86 , @entity87 ; @entity88 ( @entity89 ) , @entity90 ; @entity91 , @entity92 ( @entity93 69 ) , @entity94 ( @entity49 66 ) ; @entity95 goal : @entity95 ( 29 ) booked : @entity49 sent off : @entity49 referee : @entity98 this in itself is a rarity ; @entity0 are exceptionally good from dead ball situations , both in attack and defence			1
they have scored 10 of their 17 goals this season from set - pieces , while they rarely ship goals in those situations			0
yet after 13 minutes @entity81 whipped in a corner and @entity74 snuck in and headed it home			1
late last season @entity0 made the trip to @entity3 when they were trying to seal the title and fight off the challenge of @entity114 and @entity115			1
they earned a 1 - 0 win , thanks to a @entity89 header , with a traditionally steely peformance			2
the forward was not selected for this game , after his exploits against @entity11 in the @entity123			0
@entity9 would have wanted more of the same this time around , particularly considering @entity125 's @entity3 side have been in fine fettle this season			1
it is far too early to pin them as potential title contenders , but this triumph was a statement of intent			0
@entity0 , lacking the likes of @entity135 and @entity136 , who both featured here last season , look a weaker side			2
they have bought well , with @entity95 doing a passable job up front , but the team does n't yet have the energy of last year 's outfit			0
@entity87 , the left - back bought to replace @entity146 , now of @entity147 , was at fault for this defeat too , missing a penalty			1
@entity95 had dragged his side back into the game after @entity3 keeper @entity51 had palmed away @entity88 's stinging drive , straight into the path of the @entity155			1
he headed home from close range to give his side a lifeline , which they could have turned into a full - blown comeback had @entity87 taken more care			0
defender @entity74 is mobbed by his players after making it 3 - 0 to @entity3 @entity9 cut a typically animated figure on the touchline as @entity0 struggled at @entity3 @entity0 were denied a penalty when the ball struck @entity73 's hand , but @entity169 pointed to the spot when @entity50 committed the same crime minutes later			1
@entity51 had an excellent penalty saving record and he dived to his right to gather @entity87 's effort			2
with this stop , @entity51 joined @entity176 as a record holder , having stopped 13 penalties and seen two others missed out of the 31 he has faced			0
@entity0 worked hard in the second - half , but to no avail			0
@entity182 @entity49 had a goal ruled out in stoppage time , as he handled it before firing past @entity51			0
to add insult to injury , it earned him a second yellow card and the @entity16 was given his marching orders			0
at full - time @entity3 were sitting top of the @entity1 table , at least before @entity115 took on @entity194			1
@entity0 were a shock to the system for the @entity198 giants and @entity114 last season			0
@entity54 will be hoping his @entity3 side - still with new signing @entity201 to make his comeback from injury - can be this year 's .			2

@entity3 found themselves 3 - 0 up inside 13 minutes as hosts go top of @entity1
a @entity32 own goal plus strikes from @entity60 and @entity74 did the *damage*
@entity95 replied but @entity0 were left with too much to do
@entity87 missed a penalty for the *visitors* who also had a goal disallowed
to *compound* their misery @entity0 had @entity49 sent off
first league defeat of the season for @entity9 's men
