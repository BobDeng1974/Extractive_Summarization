as the title winners @entity3 go toe - to - toe with @entity5 holders @entity4 at @entity6 on sunday , a glittering array of stars will be on show at the home of @entity10 football			1
from @entity12 and @entity13 to @entity14 and @entity15 , this will be a meeting of some of the finest footballers in the @entity18			1
but who comes out on top in the head - to - head battles ? @entity22 runs the rule over these two teams ... goalkeeper @entity26 a shaky start to last season culminated in the @entity10 no 1 find himself on the bench for an extended spell in the winter			2
turned out to be smart management by @entity34 and @entity26 demonstrated his class in the second half of the season with several match - winning saves			2
will face competition from new signing @entity41 , mind			2
@entity10 's no 1 : @entity26 got better as last season went on after a shaky start @entity46 last season , the @entity48 stopper eliminated much of the rash decision - making that had previously blotted his copybook to enjoy his finest campaign so far			2
all smiles : @entity46 will hope @entity4 can build on their @entity5 triumph verdict : @entity26			1
a proven winner , having won two titles in three years , and a powerful voice in the @entity3 dressing room			1
expect him to step up once more with @entity59 in town			0
right back @entity61 relentless up and down the right flank , he is an immensely likeable character , firm in the tackle and a menace going forward			0
offers a regular threat making those overlapping runs			0
@entity68 the summer signing from @entity70 always tend to appear to be a better player in the blue of @entity73 than the black and white stripes in the @entity75			1
enjoyed an impressive @entity76 but has work to do to convince in the @entity18			1
strong at the back : @entity61 pips @entity4 new boy @entity68 to the best right back verdict : @entity61			1
along with @entity79 , @entity61 is seen as the finest full - back in world football and he ’d walk into any team in the @entity18			0
@entity83 @entity84 the @entity86 centre - half is @entity3 ’s most important player			1
the captain – who is currently discussing a new contract – is an inspirational leader and an outstanding defender			0
leader of men : @entity84 guided @entity3 to the @entity18 title last season @entity95 the new £ 12m signing will get his first experience of what it is like playing for @entity4 in a cup final			1
the test will be for him to keep the composure he showed at @entity104 now that he is in the big time			0
step up : @entity95 will be out to prove he can take his form from @entity104 to @entity4 verdict : @entity84			1
@entity107 is a talented young defender with plenty of potential but @entity84 has proved for several years that he is the most complete centre - back in @entity10 football			0
centre - back @entity113 the @entity114 struggled in his early days at @entity3 but has emerged through that tricky spell and demonstrated his credentials as an accomplished centre - half			1
part of the @entity120 side that reached the @entity76 final			1
new look : @entity113 is back at @entity3 with a new short back and sides after the @entity76 @entity125 @entity125 ’s more impulsive tendencies harnessed well with @entity129 ’s more serene approach last season			1
the @entity130 is quick , powerful and is also a threat at set - pieces			0
getting stuck in : @entity125 and @entity133 fight for the ball in training verdict : @entity125			0
the 28 - year - old has matured into an excellent defender under @entity139 ’s guidance and he only seems to be getting better			0
@entity113 ’ lack of pace remains a concern , underlined by @entity34 ’s pursuit of @entity144			0
left - back @entity146 prone to the odd mistake and his concentration can lapse from time to time			0
good energy and offers pace in the attacking third			0
@entity152 the @entity10 was one of @entity4 ’s most consistent performers last season and if this country were not so blessed in the left - back position – @entity152 had to compete with @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 – he would have been a shoe - in for the @entity76 in @entity161			1
defending the left : @entity146 will come up against his former club and @entity152 verdict : @entity152			0
with @entity157 now out of the picture , @entity152 can press for an @entity10 place and continue to star for @entity4			2
@entity166 @entity167 the @entity161 was magnificent in his debut season , complementing @entity13 in the central acres and dominating the midfield			2
incredible energy levels and sets the tempo			0
interesting to see if he can recover his confidence after @entity161 ’s traumatic @entity76 campaign			2
commanding : @entity167 ( left ) impressed during his first season with @entity3 @entity179 wizard : @entity14 had a good season before his injury last season @entity14 the @entity183 emerged as the division ’s best player in the first half of last season , scoring 13 goals before the end of november			1
an injury set him back in the second half of the season but reclaimed the spotlight with the winning goal in the @entity5 final against @entity195			1
a difficult one but if @entity14 replicates the form he showed this time last year , @entity4 have one of the world ’s most talented midfield players on their hands			2
central midfield @entity13 birthday cakes and summer shenanigans aside , @entity13 is the best midfielder in the country			0
he is a match - winner , scoring 24 goals as @entity3 won the title last season			1
keep lighting those candles , @entity3 fans , because @entity13 is irreplaceable			2
pass master : @entity13 helped @entity3 win the @entity18 title last season middle man : @entity216 will hope to have an injury free season @entity216 career has stagnated after such a blistering start and the images that emerged of @entity223 smoking on holiday did little to correct the feeling that this player could be taking his opportunity more seriously			1
has to score more goals and repay the faith that @entity139 continues to show in him this season			0
@entity216 ’s most valuable asset is potential while @entity13 is proven at the highest level			0
attacking midfield @entity235 his national team harshly overlooked the @entity130 for the @entity76 , particularly after such an impressive campaign last season			1
@entity3 , however , have a very gifted footballer who has had a nice long break this summer			2
former @entity4 man may feel he has something to prove to his old employers			2
@entity244 : @entity235 was left out of the @entity73 @entity76 squad despite a good season for @entity3 big money move : a lot will be expected from @entity15 after his arrival this summer @entity15 the @entity250 was one of the stars at the @entity76 and represents a major coup for @entity4			1
an explosive forward blessed with pace , skill and goals			0
the former @entity258 man is the most exciting player to be signed by a @entity18 club this summer			0
expect @entity235 to have another good season , though			1
attacking midfield @entity12 the @entity262 is @entity3 ’s conductor , pulling strings most players ca n’t even see			2
his touch is immaculate and his passing is deeply intelligent			0
such a wonderful player to watch			0
on the attack : @entity12 was key for @entity3 last season and @entity270 impressed in his debut season @entity272 @entity272 had a stop - start season last time around picking up a cruciate knee ligament injury on the opening day before returning in good form in january , only to be troubled by a groin problem at the end of the campaign			1
verdict : as impressive as @entity272 when injury free , you have to go for @entity12 for his sheer consistency in a @entity3 shirt			2
attacking midfield @entity284 only made two @entity18 starts amid a plague of injuries last season but he has been @entity3 ’s star performer in pre-season and he believes he is now ready to become a key man			1
may get the nod over @entity290 due to the @entity114 's late return for pre-season			0
back from injury : @entity284 made only just two @entity18 starts last season due to injury bright future : @entity294 has proved to be one of the more exciting players in the @entity18 @entity294 @entity4 have resisted interest from @entity298 for the talented midfielder and he will light up the @entity18 once more this season			1
on his day , @entity294 is a real joy to behold			0
@entity294 has proven himself in the @entity18 over several seasons			0
the same can not be said of @entity284			0
striker @entity304 the @entity305 stepped up when @entity306 lost his goalscoring touch last season , hitting over 25 goals for @entity34 to prove his importance to the @entity3 cause			1
clinical finisher : @entity304 has proved to be lethal in front of goal for @entity3 @entity315 be a star : @entity316 has looked good in pre-season for @entity4 @entity316 @entity139 has suggested that this game may come too soon for @entity133			1
@entity319 scored four goals against @entity321 last season after a tricky first season in the first - team last time out			0
the @entity305 is a clinical finisher and powerful in the air			0
provides @entity3 with something different in the final third			2
overall verdict @entity3 6 - 5 @entity4 @entity4 entering new era - @entity139			1

champions @entity3 face @entity5 holders @entity4 for the first *silverware* of the season
@entity15 set to make his competitive debut for @entity4
