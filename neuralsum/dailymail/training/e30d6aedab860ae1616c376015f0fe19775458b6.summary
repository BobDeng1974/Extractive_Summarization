a ' devastated ' couple were forced to remove a 6,000 gallon pond from their garden after 200 of their prized fish worth a total of £ 10,000 were eaten by an otter			1
@entity8 and @entity9 , both 60 , said the huge pond in the garden of their home in @entity14 , @entity15 , which contained about 150 goldfish and 50 other fish , was the talk of the local neighbourhood			1
wildlife including ducks , herons , kingfishers , frogs , newts and even snakes would visit the pond , and children would feed the goldfish , koi carp , mirror carp and ghost carp - some weighing up to 25lbs			1
removed : @entity33 ( centre in white top and brown trousers ) looks at the pond in @entity14 , @entity15 , where children would feed the goldfish , koi carp , mirror carp and ghost carp - some weighing up to 25lbs but when the couple returned home after a month - long visit to see their daughter in @entity47 last week they found that an otter had treated itself to a free meal			1
their neighbour had been left to clear up the half - eaten , rotting fish that were left sprawled on the decking around the pond , which has now been removed to avoid giving the otter any more to eat			1
mrs @entity33 said : ‘ people would come and bring their children to see all the fish and the wildlife			1
it was devastating for us because they were so beautiful and had been a part of our life for 25 years			0
‘ we had a good fence around the pond , a net over the top , but there is no way you could stop an otter getting in			2
we will not see the same wildlife visiting our garden anymore			2
local attraction : the couple , both 60 , said the huge pond in the garden of their home , which contained about 150 goldfish and 50 other fish , was the talk of the neighbourhood ' devastated ' : @entity9 and @entity33 returned home after a month - long visit to see their daughter in @entity47 last week to find that an otter had treated itself to a free meal ‘ we are not giving the otter another chance to kill or mutilate any more fish			1
that wildlife wo n't be in our garden now and maybe not in other gardens either after the otter has visited their ponds			2
' we are not giving the otter another chance to kill or mutilate any more fish			2
that wildlife wo n't be in our garden now and maybe not in other gardens either ' @entity33 ‘ the otters just eat the livers and the kidneys so they just left the carcasses of the fish all over our garden and our neighbour was left to clear it up while we were away			1
’ the music shop worker added : ‘ some of the larger fish like the koi and the other colourful carps altogether could be worth around the £ 10,000 mark			0
‘ money is n't the issue though , we loved these fish and they had been a part of our lives for so long			0
it 's just really devastating			0
’ valuable : wildlife including ducks , herons , kingfishers , frogs , newts and even snakes would visit the pond unwelcome visitor : the otter population plummeted towards extinction across most of lowland @entity132 in the mid- 1970s ( file picture ) the otter population plummeted towards extinction across most of lowland @entity132 in the mid- 1970s			1
to improve the situation the @entity137 in @entity15 released a number of the animals into the wild between 1984 and 1997 - with the approval of the various conservation bodies around at the time			1
an @entity145 spokesman said that there had been no reintroductions since 1999 and that the rise in otter numbers is down to the otter 's natural recovery			0
a national pot of money is available to contribute towards the cost of electric fencing - seen as the best way to protect the fish			0
but mrs @entity33 felt that not enough was done to let people know about the cash and she feels that more needs to be done to educate other pond owners			0
she added : ‘ we did n't know about this and have n't seen it advertised anywhere and it 's taken an otter to destroy our pond for us to find out about it			0
‘ we have nets and things for child safety and to stop animals getting in but it would n't stop an otter			0
‘ otters are cute , they really are , especially when they are lying on their backs and playing with the fish			0
but i feel the people who released these otters back into the @entity15 rivers have n't looked into this enough			2
