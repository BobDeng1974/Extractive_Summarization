@entity0 could be a doubt for @entity4 's @entity3 clash with @entity5 after picking up a hamstring injury on sunday			1
the @entity8 defender went off after 35 minutes of @entity4 's 3 - 2 win over @entity10 after suffering an injjury to his left leg			0
shortly after his side had fallen behind in their top of the table clash , the @entity8 was running away from a @entity10 player , before being caught by a stray leg			0
@entity0 carries the ball out of defence on one of his trademark forays , but one such run led to his injury the @entity8 defender immediately signalled to the bench that he would need to be replaced the former - @entity27 defender attempted to continue breaking forward , but pulled up sharply holding his hamstring a couple of yards later			2
the club 's official @entity31 @entity30 account confirmed it was a muscle pull , tweeting : ' @ @entity33 crumples to the floor with a hamstring pull @entity35 ' reports suggest the 27 - year - old will have scans on monday to assess the extent of the injury			0
if it is serious as suggested then @entity0 will surely be a doubt for @entity4 's upcoming games with @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity5 , whom the @entity49 side face in the first leg of their @entity3 quarter - final on april 15			1
in his absence the @entity49 champions looked less than assured , conceding a second poor goal just a few minutes after @entity0 departed , but they rallied to win the game and return to the top of the table with a better second - half display			0
@entity0 limped off , and could now be a doubt for the @entity3 quarter - final against @entity5 @entity4 will hope their star defender can recover quickly , as he is a key part of their plans			1

@entity0 pulled up in the 35th minute of @entity67 's @entity66
@entity0 was immediately replaced , and club confirmed a pulled hamstring
@entity4 defender will have scans on monday , but could be out for weeks
@entity5 meet @entity4 on april 15 in the first leg of @entity3 *tie*
