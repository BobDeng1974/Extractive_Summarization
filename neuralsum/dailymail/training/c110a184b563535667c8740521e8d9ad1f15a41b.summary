by @entity0 published : 11:57 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 12:08 est , 3 may 2013 a @entity2 shoe firm is having problems shipping its products to customers in @entity6 , and it 's founder thinks it 's all down to its name - atheist			1
about half the shipments of @entity8 shoes to the @entity11 - fearing @entity6 have been beset by lengthy delays , and the company suspects it could be because of the prominent branding on the boxes			1
the company has enjoyed massive success across the world over the past year selling its shoes , which proclaim ' i 'm an atheist ' or ' @entity21 ' on their soles			2
lost in the post : shoe company @entity8 says about half its shipments to the @entity11 - fearing @entity6 have been beset by delays , and the company suspects it could be because of the prominent branding on the boxes but now it seems the believers are hitting back , in the @entity6 at least			1
@entity30 - born company founder @entity29 told @entity32 news site @entity33 : ' about half our shipments to the @entity6 have seen lengthy delays			1
' we accept that the odd delay and even the occasional disappearance are bound to happen			0
but the problem did get significantly worse for us last autumn , which happened to be when we started using @entity8 - branded tape			2
' mr @entity29 , 34 , said that he believed that it was the prominent placing of the word ' @entity8 ' on the outside of their packaging that was attracting the ire of @entity6 postal workers			2
around 75 per cent of @entity6 identify themselves as @entity48 , according to recent surveys , compared to just 15 - 20 per cent who express no religious affiliation			1
those numbers are practically reversed in @entity8 shoes ' home town of @entity55 , where roughly two - thirds of the population believe there is no @entity11			0
in order to test mr @entity29 's theory , the @entity8 team decided to conduct an experiment			0
they sent 89 customers two packages : one sealed with @entity8 - branded tape , the other with neutral tape			0
all the packages were sent from @entity55 on the same day , but the @entity8 - branded packages took an average of three days longer to reach their destinations			0
not only that , but while just one unbranded package went missing in the post , a stunning nine @entity8 - branded packages disappeared on route to their intended recipient			2
unholy soles : the company 's shoes include such slogans as ' ich bin atheist ' and ' @entity21 ' the company wrote in its website : ' having run a series of control tests in @entity2 and @entity88 , which demonstrate no such bias , the problem appears to lie in the @entity6 and is likely explained by the differential handling of packages by employees of the @entity93			1
' interestingly , this seems to be a national problem - traditionally less religious and more liberal states also saw high delay and disappearance			0
' sadly many of our customers who took part in this experiment were not surprised by our findings , even though tampering with post is a federal offence			0
' mr @entity29 said he believes the company may have lost as many as 25 shipments on their way to @entity6 customers			1
asked what he thinks happens to them , he said : ' @entity11 knows			0
maybe it is truly divine intervention			0
' to forestall any further acts of @entity11 , @entity8 shoes have since ceased using their branded tape on packages sent to the @entity6			1

company claims about half its shipments to @entity6 have been beset by delays
shoes sent in branded ones were 10 times more likely to go missing
around 75 per cent of @entity6 proclaim themselves as @entity48
