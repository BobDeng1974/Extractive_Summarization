by @entity0 published : 06:10 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 06:23 est , 24 october 2013 ' shocking ' : an mp has condemned the toll of military dogs put down since 2009 more than 350 retired military dogs have been put down since 2009 , figures reveal today			1
the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) put down 42 @entity8 dogs due to a " dangerous temperament " , while 27 developed cancer - related health problems			1
the majority , 117 were put down due to ' age and welfare ' reasons while 76 had osteoarthritis			0
four were killed in action in @entity17 , and a fifth was put down due to injuries from a road accident			0
mps and animal charities have called on the @entity6 to ensure euthanising elderly dogs is a ' last resort '			1
@entity26 mp @entity25 said she was ' genuinely shocked '			1
she added : ' when the @entity6 invests millions of taxpayers ' money on training these animals , it seems unfortunate that their ongoing welfare is not taken nearly as seriously			1
' i have always believed that the way people treat animals says a lot about them , and i hope that the release of these figures into the public domain will lead to greater planning and a more compassionate approach in future			1
' the figures have been released weeks after it emerged two @entity47 dogs which guarded prince @entity48 were put down days after he left the service			1
@entity51 shepherd @entity50 and @entity53 shepherd blade were put down shortly after the @entity55 's final shift at @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58			2
protected : prince @entity48 's two guard dogs were destroyed days after he left the @entity47			1
mp @entity25 , pictured right with her pet @entity61 at the @entity63 show , said she was shocked by the figures when the story emerged the @entity6 agreed to review its policy to ensure a military vet and experienced dog handler are both involved in every decision to put a dog down			1
a spokesman added a further 419 dogs were rehomed between january 2009 and june this year			0
a spokesman for the @entity74 , the @entity8 's largest dog rehoming charity , said it understood most ex-service dogs could not be rehomed as pets due to their past			0
but he added : ' deployment to another role or retirement to a specialist handler within the service community are two options explored by the @entity6 that @entity74 would always advocate for healthy dogs			2
' @entity74 never puts a healthy dog down and is opposed to the premature euthanasia of working dogs when retired or no longer able to perform their duties			0
we actively encourage specialist rehoming and retirement programmes			0
' @entity96 , mp for @entity97 and @entity98 and chairman of the @entity100 for @entity101 , said : ' dogs employed in our armed services demonstrate commitment to their handlers and bravery on a daily basis and have undoubtedly saved the lives of countless servicemen and women			0
' we have a duty of care for their well - being as real as the military covenant			0
' i think it is vitally important that we make sure that none of the 117 dogs that were put down because of ' age and welfare ' reasons since 2009 were done so out of expediency			0
' military dogs are used as guards and some can be trained to sniff out improvised explosives mr @entity96 added : ' the government has stated that there are no time restrictions on a dog being kept while a suitable home is looked for and i hope that the @entity6 bears this in mind			2
' according to the figures , 68 dogs were put down in 2009 , 117 in 2010 , 84 in 2011 , and 71 in 2012			2
thirty were put down between january and july this year			0
@entity135 , conservative mp for @entity136 , said the sheer numbers ' led many to question the motives behind this policy '			0
the @entity6 said ' every effort ' was made to rehome dogs , but illnesses caused by old age forced some of them to be destroyed			2
a spokesman added : ' the @entity6 has a moral and legal duty to ensure the welfare of our animals and only put down those dogs that can not be rehomed			1
' we announced in september that we would review our existing policy to ensure that consistency across the @entity6 ' military working dogs play an invaluable role on the front line helping to save the lives of our armed forces and local residents in @entity17			1
' dogs are afforded as much protection as possible and handlers are specifically trained to minimise the risks that dogs face in performing their tasks			0

just 42 dogs had a ' dangerous temperament ' - most had health problems
figures come just weeks after prince @entity48 's guard dogs were put down
mp @entity25 : ' the way people treat animals says a lot about them '
@entity6 is reviewing policy , agreeing it has a ' moral and legal duty ' to animals
