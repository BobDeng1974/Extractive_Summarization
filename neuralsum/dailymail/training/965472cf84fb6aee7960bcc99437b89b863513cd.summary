@entity1 racing director @entity0 is to sit down with ceo @entity2 this week for a final round of talks in a bid to resolve the team 's driver line - up for 2015			1
discussions have been ongoing between the duo for some time as they mull over who should partner the returning @entity10 , who is due to be confirmed by @entity1 by the end of next week			1
after negotiating his severance payment with @entity15 , as @entity10 had two years remaining on his agreement with the team , the @entity13 is to join @entity1 on a two - year deal , with the option of a third			1
@entity1 chiefs are yet to decide who will be in their driver 's line - up next season one of either @entity25 ( left ) or @entity26 will leave the team after the final race in @entity29 as to his team - mate , paddock sources have suggested @entity0 and @entity2 have a difference of opinion , with the @entity35 favouring @entity25 , whilst the latter prefers @entity26			1
with @entity2 promising in early september to deliver an answer by the end of the campaign in @entity29 , the clock is ticking , although he ultimately has the final call			0
if @entity2 needed any convincing @entity25 's experience was the way to go then his performance over the weekend in @entity45 will have helped			1
in qualifying fifth and finishing fourth at @entity47 , the 34 - year - old has now scored nearly double the number of @entity26 's points - 106 to 55			1
@entity25 has almost twice as many points as his team - mate after finishing fourth at the @entity45 @entity52 @entity10 is close to confirming his switch from @entity15 to @entity1 ahead of next season @entity0 refused to be drawn on whether anything could be read into the result , other than to state it was ' a great weekend for the team '			1
@entity0 added : ' prior to @entity60 ( @entity61 ) we were a little bit down			0
' but in two of the last three races now we have clearly shown we are capable of putting cars in the top five - @entity68 ( @entity67 @entity52 ) was a little more difficult			2
' but the performance levels are rising , we 're closing the gap , and for me it is important to seize this momentum at the end of the season			2
' it means everything we have done through the season is now starting to pay off , and we are building for the future , so it 's good			2
' but this weekend specifically , and this race specifically , @entity25 did really great			2
' average start 8.61 average finish 7.06 pole positions 0 0.00 per cent race wins 0 0.00 per cent podium finishes 1 5.56 per cent @entity85 finishes 6 33.33 per cent race performance 103.13 per cent finished races 16 88.89 per cent @entity88 : 230.91 @entity90 points : 106 average start 8.78 average finish 9.29 pole positions 0 0.00 per cent race wins 0 0.00 per cent podium finishes 1 5.56 per cent @entity85 finishes 2 11.11 per cent race performance 83.53 per cent finished races 17 94.44 per cent @entity96 : 194.64 @entity98 points : 55 following the anomaly of their result in @entity103 , with @entity26 second and @entity25 third after @entity107 's @entity106 was disqualified , the campaign has been one of struggle up until late			1
@entity0 is convinced the team now have a platform on which to build for next year when @entity113 return to the sport as their power - unit supplier			2
' chassis-wise i 'm very happy , ' added @entity0			0
' every development we have done since the summer is applicable on next year 's car , so it 's a whole concept i have pushed very hard for to ensure it went through			0
' so we have improved the car this year , which is very good , and everything we have learned will benefit next year 's car , which is also very good			0
' @entity26 ( right ) was elevated to second at the @entity103 @entity52 but has struggled for form since the great unknown , however , is how @entity113 will perform , particularly as they are a year behind rivals @entity126 , @entity15 and @entity127 with regard to the development of the power unit			1
' i 'm sure they 're going to be good , ' insisted @entity0			0
' it will be a very steep learning curve for them on driveability , on just working together			0
' after 20 years with @entity126 we 've had a strong relationship , but this is a new partner , new people , and also a different culture			0
' so everything will be new , which means it will take time to fit and match together , but we know it 's going to be good			0
' for now , as we say , do n't over-promise , over deliver			0
