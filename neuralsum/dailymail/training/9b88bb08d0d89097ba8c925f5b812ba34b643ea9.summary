by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 19:38 est , 14 may 2012 updated : 08:56 est , 15 may 2012 sadness : @entity3 , chairman of the @entity4 , said he regretted failing to challenge race rules thousands of children have lost the chance of a decent life because of the ban on mixed - race adoption , the state equality chief has admitted			1
@entity3 said it was his greatest regret that he failed to challenge the race rules which denied children the chance of a loving family and instead left them at the mercy of a failing care system			1
changes could have been made 10 years ago if the race relations watchdog had called for an inquiry , mr @entity3 said			1
the acknowledgement by mr @entity3 of the damage done by the ban follows the @entity27 ’s decision to legislate to sweep away race rules			1
the new law will reinforce guidelines already handed to social workers that tell them the need to find a family for a child is more important than their longstanding doctrine which says , for example , it is bad for a black child to be brought up by a white family			0
for more than two decades adoptive parents have been strictly screened on race grounds , with many rejected because they have been judged the wrong match			2
social workers have been trained to believe that black children lose self - esteem and pride in themselves if they are not brought up by parents of the same colour			2
critics have said there is no evidence to support this theory and that race has been used as an excuse to depress the number of adoptions			2
mr @entity3 , who is to step down as chairman of the @entity62 this summer , said he should have challenged the race ban when he was appointed chief of its race relations predecessor , the @entity4 , in 2003			1
he told the @entity68 ’s @entity67 : ‘ if i had to pinpoint one single thing i would say that i wish when i took over at the cre i had been more aggressive on the issue of transracial adoption			2
‘ if i had ordered an inquiry , an investigation , it would have shown pretty clearly that the life chances of children would have been much much better in a family of any race compared to staying in care			1
' i would have then be able to essentially change the policy in local authorities 10 years ago			0
’ mr @entity3 added : ‘ my personal regret is that hundreds of children , maybe thousands of children , would now be in families who got stuck in the care system			1
if i had to go back and do something different , i would do something about that			0
‘ being in care is the surest indicator that you will end up in crime , in drugs , that you will end up unemployed , and your children will repeat your experience			0
’ he added : ‘ i think if we had been more aggressive on this issue we could have transformed the lives of very many children			0
but these are things we know in hindsight			0
’ it was the first time mr @entity3 is thought publicly to have criticised the ban on mixed - race adoptions , although critics of the system have long held that adoption was the last area of public life in @entity111 in which authorities were prepared to support open racial discrimination			1
history : in 2000 @entity116 suggested that the bar to transracial adoption should go in 2000 @entity116 suggested that the bar to transracial adoption should go , and his government began to publish figures illustrating how long black children had to wait for new families because of the race rules			1
but his 2002 @entity125 had nothing to say about race			0
mr @entity3 was the leading @entity129 figure on the @entity130 at the time			2
he went on to head the @entity4 and then the @entity62 when it took over from all the state equality bodies in 2007			0
social workers have long been criticised for failing to back adoption for children in care , preferring to see them brought up in the care system which often means life in a children ’s home or shifted repeatedly between different foster parents			1
middle class couples hoping to adopt have long been rejected on a series of flimsy grounds , including their age , their smoking habits , or their beliefs			0
there are currently around 65,000 children in the care system , with numbers rising because more children are being taken into state care following the @entity154 scandal in 2008			0
last year just 3,050 children were adopted from state care , among them only 60 babies under a year old , the lowest total since 2001 .			0
