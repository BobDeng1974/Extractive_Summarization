it was billed by those who took part as the ‘ road trip to end all road trips ’			1
taking in a private island , one of the finest hotel suites in the world and several hundred surgically - enhanced young blondes , it did not disappoint			0
in fact prince @entity12 ’s ten - day holiday bore an uncanny resemblance to the hit film @entity15 in which a stag party trip to @entity18 ends up with one member losing a tooth and another finding himself saddled with a baby – all while a tiger prowls round their hotel room			1
chilling out : prince @entity12 relaxes with his friends at the @entity18 swimming pool			1
the holiday was billed by those who took part as the ' road trip to end all road trips ' perhaps the writing was already on the wall as @entity12 and his pals excitedly packed their bags in preparation little over a week ago			1
accompanying the third in line to the throne were two of his closest friends – @entity44 , 25 , and 30 - year - old @entity45			1
the latter is the son of the infamous ‘ @entity48 ’ , brigadier @entity49 , one of @entity52 ’s richest and most secretive men			0
the brigadier , who died from lung cancer five years ago , amassed an estimated £ 500million fortune as an adventurer and arms dealer in oil - rich @entity57			0
his @entity58 and @entity60 - educated son and heir has since been named as the 397th wealthiest person in @entity52 with a personal fortune estimated at £ 200million			0
according to close friends , @entity45 posted a picture of his ‘ dubious ’ suitcase on his @entity68 site which included the following list : ‘ 2x flip flops , 3x board shorts , 8x fancy - dress outfits , 1x toothbrush , 1x toothpaste , 10x awesomeness			1
’ among the fancy - dress outfits were captain @entity77 , a storm trooper and what appears to be a gas mask			0
the group took over a £ 1,000 - a - day vip bungalow at the @entity84 for one of its infamous @entity87 pool parties			1
these raucous alcohol - fuelled events are popular in @entity89 and involve several thousand young people attempting to get as drunk as humanly possible while pulling members of the opposite sex @entity93 , the other member of the unholy trinity , is known as @entity12 ’s ‘ wingman ’			1
the son of a @entity98 field - master , @entity60 economics graduate @entity44 is inseparable from @entity12			1
according to friends the two ‘ egg each other on shamelessly ’ : just look at who was by the prince ’s side when he threw himself into a nightclub swimming pool in @entity104 last summer			2
@entity106 is n’t particularly shy himself at stripping off and as a fellow redhead , bearing a passing resemblance to @entity111 star @entity110 , is not averse to sharing the attentions of @entity12 ’s many female admirers			1
accompanied by the prince ’s new romantic interest , blonde beauty @entity115 , daughter of a four - times married and divorced aristocratic 60s ‘ it - girl ’ , the group flew out first class en route to sir @entity123 ’s private @entity122 paradise of @entity124			2
they enjoyed a week - long holiday to celebrate his son @entity128 ( a spokesman for @entity123 confirms the trip but insists that @entity12 paid for his own flight )			1
friends say that within hours @entity45 had posted a picture on @entity68 of the prince apparently passed out in the sand with the words : ‘ @entity124 – perfect start			1
’ @entity139 is known about the rest of the holiday – suffice to say it involved sun , sea , sand and plenty of booze – but last weekend the boys turned up minus @entity149 in @entity89 , which @entity12 had been keen to revisit following a trip last year with his @entity153 pals			1
chilling out : the prince relaxes dances in the water with a vest on reading ' @entity158 ' that he appears to have borrowed from another party - goer the group were put up at the five - star @entity163 casino complex in a three - bedroom @entity165 suite which costs a cool £ 5,100 a night			2
@entity167 has not disputed suggestions that the accommodation was offered as a ‘ freebie ’ or at a significantly reduced rate – not that most members of the party could n’t afford it			1
the prince ’s security detail enjoyed their own room next door courtesy of the @entity122 taxpayer			0
offering unparalleled views of @entity18 ’s famous strip , the duplex measures 5,829 square feet and , as has memorably been shown , boasts its own billiard table			0
the group wasted little time in hitting the hotel ’s casino that night where @entity12 was seen profusely apologising to staff after accidentally smashing his cocktail glass and spilling his drink on one of the gaming tables			2
afterwards they were seen playing the dice game craps			0
and then , within hours , they had apparently met some ‘ hot chicks ’ and were playing naked billiards			0
@entity197 of beauties : a host of girls line up at the @entity18 pool party all wearing the same group t - shirt as prince @entity12 it is not clear who are the girls featured in the nude pictures , but it is suggested that he might have bumped into them in either the @entity163 casino or the nightclub xs			1
there is little doubt over the location , though , as the distinctive checked carpet can be seen both in the grainy mobile phone photos and in pictures on the hotel website			0
it is understood that the naked snaps were passed on to the @entity221 gossip website tmz by a member of the party – not one of @entity12 ’s friends – before being posted in the early hours of yesterday @entity52 time			1
the following day they took over a £ 1,000 - a - day vip bungalow at the @entity84 for one of its infamous @entity87 pool parties			1
these raucous alcohol - fuelled events are popular in @entity89 and involve several thousand young people attempting to get as drunk as humanly possible while pulling members of the opposite sex in the fierce sunshine			2
taking in the scenery : @entity12 's attention is drawn to a pneumatic blonde poolside at the @entity87 's @entity87 party by the end of the day , say those with intimate knowledge of such events , the pools contain more urine than water and couples are openly having sex			1
@entity12 ’s bungalow came with a flat - screen tv and gaming system , chaise longues ( with reversible headrests for when the sun is facing the other way ) , a fridge , a private spa area and bathroom as well as a ‘ misting system ’ spraying out filtered water to cool down overheated guests			2
outside was a private @entity260 from which @entity12 and his group watched the action and chatted to a group of girls who had taken the place next door for a ‘ bachelorette ’ , or hen party			2
waiters offered a menu including £ 65 pitchers of ‘ dragonberry ’ mojitos and even a £ 13,000 15 - litre bottle of @entity276 champagne			2
@entity12 stripped to a pair of flowered surfing shorts and thong - style necklace , sporting a white fedora to shade his face from the sun. the excited ladies next door were soon posting pictures on @entity285 of them posing with the prince , whom they described as a ‘ gentleman ’			1
sheepish : prince @entity12 hugs a mystery blonde and appears to send a text on his mobile phone as he is spotted in a @entity292 car park just an hour after naked pictures of him cavorting with strangers in a @entity89 hotel emerged online bashful : wearing a blue shirt and cream - coloured panama hat , the prince appears far less confident than he did in the pictures of him in @entity89 keeping quiet : @entity12 refused to comment when quizzed about the risqué snaps which were taken in a @entity89 hotel suite on friday night ‘ he asked , “ which one of you is single ? ” , ’ said one			1
‘ and he was sticking out his tongue acting really loud and goofy			0
’ the prince apparently promised to visit the girls that night			0
much to their disappointment he did n’t show			0
the following day he and his friends were at another pool party , at the @entity313 , taking a bungalow with its own infinity hot tub			0
the prince ’s night rounded off with a visit to @entity318 – where other vip guests included @entity321 gold medallist swimmer @entity320			0
@entity12 being @entity12 , he could n’t resist challenging him to a race in the pool , throwing himself into the water still in his jeans			0
he was soon joined by the fully - clothed swimmer , who only just beat the prince in the contest thanks to a reveller grabbing his leg as he tried to kick off			0
afterwards a group of @entity334 boys from @entity335 took to @entity285 to boast about their ‘ legendary night ’			0
‘ just spend my night with prince harry and @entity320 , life does n’t get any f * * * * * * better ! ! ! ! ! ’ said @entity336 , before claiming that @entity12 jokingly suggested they all commit a sex act on each other in celebration when he stole a giant inflatable swan for him			2
‘ he kissed me on the lips			0
i ca n’t describe how this night was with harry ! ! i thru him in the pool			0
legend ! ! ! x ’ when another member of the group , @entity353 , was asked by the @entity354 if he would talk about the night , he replied rather touchingly : ‘ no sorry ! ! he was so nice to us i ’m not willing to speak about our night out ! ! we promised that we would savour the night as a memory ! best night of me life			0
’ what a shame for the prince that more of his new - found ‘ friends ’ were n’t equally discreet .			2
