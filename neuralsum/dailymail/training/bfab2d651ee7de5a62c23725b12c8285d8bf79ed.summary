by @entity0 gone is the @entity2			1
instead , applications , widgets and social network updates appear in the form of a mosaic of tiles			2
everything is touch - friendly , as you swipe across screens to access more tiles and more tiles			2
this is the new version of @entity17 , and it is almost ready for prime - time , with @entity20 preparing @entity17 8 for launch in october			1
@entity17 fans may lament their loss , but @entity20 has seen the future , and it is all about touch			1
bye bye desktop , hello @entity28 ! the new @entity17 will look very different to all previous versions the new @entity30 takes some ideas from @entity32 and @entity34 's mobile app stores , and users swipe right - to - left across screens for more options @entity20 officially announced the time - frame for @entity40 's mass - market release this morning at a company conference in @entity42			1
new versions of @entity17 typically come out every three years , but this update is the most widely anticipated overhaul of the software since 1995			2
@entity20 , based in @entity47 , @entity48 , has designed the operating system so it can run on personal computers or touch - based tablet computers			1
desktop aficionados may lament the new focus on touch - and wonder how it will work on older , non-touchscreen computers			2
critics may also wonder whether touch is any kind of replacement for keyboard and mouse in terms of day - to - day productivity			2
luckily those who miss the old approach will still find their desktop accessible			2
but now it is more like a program , in the same way @entity69 or @entity70 are programs			0
the company is also putting a special price on its next version of @entity17 - offering upgrades to the operating system for just $ 40			0
the offer , which translates to about £ 25 in the @entity79 , will run until next january and applies to the previous versions of @entity81 , @entity82 , and @entity83			0
@entity20 has not yet confirmed the price in the @entity79 yet , but the company is likely to price the upgrade at between £ 25 and £ 40			1
@entity20 will also throw @entity86 , which allows you to browse picture , music and video files from a distance , in for free			1
the new panels add items such as weather widgets and social network updates @entity20 will be anxious to get the latest windows on to as many desktops as possible , following the rising popularity of @entity32 and @entity34 tablets , and @entity100 and @entity34 - as well as other companies - encroaching in on the @entity20 - heavy segment of the pc market			1
@entity40 will be quite an evolution			0
the core @entity17 concept has changed little in more than 20 years , but for the first time , @entity20 is dramatically overhauling the interface , making it touch - friendly			1
the @entity2 - and the desktop - have both gone , to be replaced with the @entity28 interface , which uses ' @entity110 ' for updates and for programs , in a manner similar to @entity114 , and the upcoming @entity116 tablet			1
those upgrading from @entity83 will be able to keep all their settings , programs and files , while the older operating systems have some caveats , such as the inability to carry programs over from @entity82 , and settings over from xp			0
@entity20 announced the moves last night on the company blog			1
a spokesman said : ' we believe that your upgrade experience in @entity40 will be a breeze by offering a faster experience , a single upgrade path , and compatibility from prior versions of @entity17			0
' we ’ve continued to listen to our customers and have expanded the ability to download to over 100 countries and 37 languages			0
' we have simplified the @entity17 upgrade experience with the @entity143 which supports you during your upgrade with everything from selecting your language to pausing your download to built - in compatibility checks - it ’s seamless			0
and if you ’re an enthusiast you will have the flexibility to download and control how you upgrade			0
' if you prefer to shop at a local store , a packaged dvd version of the upgrade to @entity155 will be available for $ 69.99 during this promotion			0
' this upgrade promotion for @entity155 both online and at retail runs through january 31st , 2013			0
' we will of course have more to say and more details to provide closer to general availability			0
