by @entity0 published : 12:31 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 12:31 est , 2 may 2013 this week it was revealed that increasing numbers of childless women are signing up to ' natural insemination ' websites - online meeting places that put women who want sperm together with men who want sex			1
despite the obvious risks it has been suggested that women are turning to the sites because of the soaring cost of @entity15 , which can be up to £ 2,000 per cycle using donor sperm			0
but does that mean having unprotected sex with a stranger in order to have a baby - who will never know its father - any more acceptable ? many , including parenting expert @entity23 , believe getting pregnant this way will always be wrong - from a moral and a health standpoint			1
but journalist @entity27 believes that women should be allowed to get pregnant in any way they wish			1
appearing on this morning , @entity27 admitted she has even gone one further with her thought process - once writing of her plans to trick a stranger into getting her pregnant should motherhood not have happened to her in time			1
@entity27 admitted that while she did not go through with plans to trick a stranger into impregnating her , she still stands by the idea			1
' sitting back and waiting to become a parent is archaic , ' she argued			0
there 's no point in sitting around and waiting for it [ parenthood ] to happen to you			2
' asked by @entity56 why she did not have the planned one night stand she said : ' my circumstances changed			0
i 've got my little girl , my house ... so it just did n't happen			0
' @entity27 shot to fame last year when she wrote an article headlined : ' i 'll trick a stranger into giving me another child : a single mother who 's desperate to be pregnant again , confesses all ... ' in the piece , which appeared in the @entity69 , @entity27 wrote : ' i have decided to find a man to provide a second child for me			1
' the transaction will be an uncomplicated one : he will sleep with me - once , if my plan works out - and i will become pregnant			1
family : @entity27 with daughter @entity76 ( left ) and @entity77 with her son @entity78 ( right ) ' and that is where his paternal duty will end			1
there will be no rights or obligations on his part : no access visits , no calls on his time and attention ; and he will have no financial involvement in the child ’s upbringing whatsoever			0
' during the interview , she revealed that the support she got in the wake of the piece was phenomenal and said that it ' made it even more apparent that it [ natural insemination ] does go on all the time			0
' ' what is difference between one night stands and natural donation ? ' she added			0
' i would n't trick anyone			2
the actual story was more that if someone pulled me up on it , i 'd admit it			0
but if woman goes into bar and is n't actively deceiving the man then there 's no problem			2
' horrified , @entity23 riposted : ' everyone knows that [ unplanned ] pregnancies do happen but i would expect most women to do their utmost to tell the man what has happened			1
' the problem with websites like these is that they reduce having a baby to scouring the internet for sperm			0
i would also ask why men are doing it ? for sex ? ' not true , says @entity27 , who said that she had discovered that some would - be natural inseminators genuinely want to help out			1
heated : things got a bit tense when @entity27 got into an argument with @entity56 ' some men genuinely want to provide sperm and just want to see life go on , ' she said			1
' they do n't want responsibility for the child , so this is right for them			0
' but for @entity23 , having sex with a stranger purely to get pregnant is nothing more than ' no - strings sex '			1
' we grew up with messages about the dangers of having unprotected sex , ' she explained			2
' at least if it 's with your partner , you know what you 're getting into			2
' in response to @entity36 , who likened it to normal sperm donation , she added : ' i think if you go to an organisation , then it 's very different from picking someone up			2
and what if you later meet someone and have children with them ? ' you have a child with no idea who they really are and you ca n't exactly tell them what really happened [ when they were conceived ]			0
' it 's very different to deliberately go into situation that could put your health or life at risk			0

@entity27 and @entity23 appeared on @entity42 's @entity43
@entity27 once wrote she would trick a stranger into getting her pregnant
@entity23 is opposed to the idea , calling it ' *unsafe* ' and ' no - strings sex '
