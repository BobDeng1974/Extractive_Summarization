but that could all be set to change after a court ruling that could see landlords and letting agents fined up to £ 20,000 if they allow guests to run riot at their properties			1
in the first decision of its kind , a judge upheld a noise abatement notice handed to letting agent @entity29 following a string of complaints about a property managed by her @entity26 business			1
mrs @entity29 appealed the notice handed to her from @entity80 council , arguing she could not be held responsible for the noise coming from the property as she was not the one staying there			1
but district judge @entity84 dismissed the appeal , stating that mrs @entity29 should be accountable for the disturbances			2
the ruling means landlords and lettings agents will now be held accountable should complaints be made about groups staying in their houses , and could be liable for fines of up to £ 20,000 if they flout noise abatement orders in future			1

' living next door to one has been sheer misery for us and our neighbours			0
' from spring through to autumn each year we have been unable to sleep with our windows open and we have been constantly woken up in the early hours by large groups coming back from nights out			0
' while this ruling is not the complete answer it 's a step in the right direction because it means letting agents and landlords who specialise in short - term rentals can now be held accountable for the behaviour of their guests			1
' they face a £ 20,000 fine for flouting the noise abatement order so hopefully that will be enough to encourage them to take responsibility for what goes on at their properties			1
' what it does n't do is prevent these houses being rented out to huge groups of people in the first place , it only stops them from making noise deemed excessive			2
