by @entity1 reporter published : 11:40 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 08:00 est , 13 august 2013 why stand in line all morning when you can make your own @entity4 in about an hour ? first sold by the @entity6 in @entity7 , the croissant - doughnut that took over the city ’s @entity10 neighborhood earlier this year can now be made from the comfort of your own kitchen			1
the good news ? you do n’t need any croissants , doughnuts or an alarm clock			2
behold : @entity6 's cronuts can now be had without hours on line or by paying through the nose on @entity23 the ingredients for the dough are all fairly common : butter , an egg , flour , milk , salt , sugar , water and yeast			1
a fancy @entity34 market is n’t necessary , any supermarket will do			2
according to the recipe from @entity38 , the first step is to combine the salt , yeast butter , flour and sugar and blend in a food processor while heating the milk and water on a stove			2
once thoroughly blended and combined with an egg , the ingredients should go in the refrigerator while the dough rises			0
while the yeast is doing its thing , it ’s time to make the filling			0
combine eggs , sugar , flour and your fruit of choice , in this case oranges , and heat all ingredients thoroughly			0
once your filling is ready , your dough should be good to go			0
easy as pie : you too can make @entity4 by following this diagram what line ? : standing on - line for @entity4 is so last - month remove it from the fridge , roll it out and dust with flour before folding it over three times and cutting the cronuts using a doughnut cutter			1
next up is the most fun part ! deep fry each side at 160 degrees @entity81 for about one minute while dumping strawberries , icing sugar , egg white and lemon into a blender for your frosting			0
the icing should be ready by the time the cronuts cool down			0
put it all together and you ’ll be ready to brag to your friends invented by @entity34 baker @entity6 and sold at his @entity10 bakery since june , cronuts fans spend hours each morning on line to buy the famous pastries - which usually sell out shortly after the bakery 's 8am opening			1
cronuts have even spawned an underground economy , with pricey delivery services springing up on @entity23 .			1
