by @entity1 reporter last updated at 1:15 am on 9th december 2011 women are to be allowed to serve on submarines for the first time in the @entity6 ’s history			2
female officers can serve beneath the waves on vanguard - class subs , which carry the @entity12 nuclear deterrent , from 2013 , defence secretary @entity7 announced yesterday			1
women of lower rank will follow two years later , when they will be able to serve on the new state - of - the - art £ 1.2billion @entity17 - class ‘ hunter - killer ’ submarines			2
female officers will begin serving on @entity21 submarines from 2013 the announcement breaks more than 100 years of tradition			2
women had been barred from subs because of concerns that carbon dioxide in the recycled air could damage their fertility			2
there were also concerns among top brass that the presence of women could create disruptive relationships on underwater missions that often last months			0
but mr @entity7 said he was scrapping the long - standing ban on females on the recommendation of admiral sir @entity40 , the head of the @entity6 , after experts at the @entity42 concluded that health fears were ‘ unfounded ’			1
@entity7 has announced that women can serve on submarines pregnant sailors , however , will still be banned from going to sea amid concerns that fumes could damage an unborn child			1
addressing the @entity52 think - tank , mr @entity7 said @entity21 ’s @entity57 would ‘ value our history and tradition – but we will not be slaves to them ’			1
the lifting of the ban ends one of the last all - male bastions of the @entity57 following pressure to introduce equal opportunities throughout the military			0
wrens have served on @entity6 surface ships since a ban was lifted two decades ago , and about 9 per cent of personnel are now female			0
the @entity74 , @entity73 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 navies already allow women to serve on their submarines			0
and last year the @entity77 axed the ban on female submariners			0
the new @entity17 attack submarines could easily be adapted so females have their own areas with showers and beds			0
new @entity17 class submarines will have women serving on them from 2015 @entity7 has confirmed that the final estimate of the cost of military operations in @entity90 was £ 212million			1
the figure is less than the last estimate issued by the @entity93 in october of £ 300million			1
the fall is primarily due to a drop in the estimated cost of replacing spent munitions from £ 140million to £ 67million			1
mr @entity7 stressed there was no going back on the cuts in the government 's @entity100 ( @entity100 )			1
' the situation we face now - after the years of political failure to grip the problem - is that eliminating the black hole in the defence budget is the only way to sustain military capability over the long - term , ' he said			0
' of course there are many valid and finely balanced arguments about the utility and necessity of individual capabilities			0
but let 's be under no illusions - unpicking the @entity100 piece by piece is simply not an option			0
