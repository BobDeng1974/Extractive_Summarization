an advertising agency has caused outrage after creating a promotion for a mattress company which depicts schoolgirl @entity4 being shot in the face			1
the advert shows @entity4 , who was 14 when she was shot by a @entity8 extremist , falling backwards covered in blood , being attached to a drip and then ' bouncing back ' to receive an award			1
a staff member at global firm @entity14 initially defended the advert as a tribute - but the firm has now apologised and launched an investigation after it was blasted as wildly insensitive			1
the other two ads in the series show @entity36 leaving his career as a barrister to become a peace activist , and @entity40 bouncing back after he was kicked out of @entity41			1
a person claiming to be a representative of @entity20 , posting on the @entity45 website , initially wrote : ' we do not believe that getting shot in the face was the defining moment in this brave young 14 - year - old ’s life - it was her courage and determination to rise from hopeless circumstances			1
' we believe that her ’s is a breathtakingly inspiring story and while all of us do not have the raw courage or moral fiber to do what she did , we can try to pay a tribute to her by any means available to us			1
' in this case , the means happened to be an advertising campaign			0
if we were architects , we would erect a monument in her honor			0
' but the advert was savaged by industry experts , including @entity68 executive @entity67			0
campaign : the other two adverts posted online featured @entity40 ( left ) and @entity36 ' bouncing back ' treatment : @entity73 soldiers shift injured women 's rights activist @entity4 , then 14 , from a helicopter at an army hospital following the extremist gun attack in @entity77 in october 2012 he wrote on his blog : ' 14 - year - olds getting shot in the face by terrorists are appropriate content for mattress ads now ? ' i am ashamed to be in the same industry as these ad people			1
' the advert has now been removed from the @entity45 website , while the firm behind it has apologised and launched a probe into what it said was a breach of standards			1
' we deeply regret this incident and want to personally apologise to @entity4 and her family			2
we are investigating how our standards were compromised in this case and will take whatever corrective action is necessary ' @entity14 's @entity28 spokesman @entity102 said : ' the recent @entity27 ads from our @entity28 office are contrary to the beliefs and professional standards of @entity14 and our clients			1
' we deeply regret this incident and want to personally apologise to @entity4 and her family			2
' we are investigating how our standards were compromised in this case and will take whatever corrective action is necessary			0
' in addition , we have launched a thorough review of our approval and oversight processes across our global network to help ensure that our standards are never compromised again			2
' he added : ' this was a paid client campaign and only the @entity40 piece ran in a local newspaper in @entity28 a few weeks ago			1
' the @entity4 piece has never been in paid media - nor will it be			2
' @entity4 ’s representatives said the advert was ' distasteful ' , but declined to comment further			0
one @entity126 user , @ juelzkeyte , said : ' just had to pick my jaw off my desk at the news @entity4 's image is being used for a mattress advert			1
' she added : ' i just do n't even know where to begin with this			0
' heroine : the education rights campaigner pictured last year ( left ) and when she was 12 years old ( right ) the advert is only the latest in a long line to cause offence so far this year			1
this week a ' lewd ' @entity145 advert was criticised for trying literally to ' sex up ' the @entity149 elections with a bare - chested hero called @entity151 , who was depicted in bed with five women before punching non-voters in the face			2
in march a billboard in @entity157 advertising an @entity159 bistro with a woman 's naked back and the words ' always a happy ending ' was slammed for using ' insulting ' stereotypes			1
@entity167 bookmaker @entity165 , meanwhile , provoked outrage by taking bets on the @entity172 trial ’s outcome and offering to refund punters if he was cleared			0
and in january a ' degrading ' advertisement depicting a beef patty sandwiched between a woman 's buttocks , proclaiming ' the freshest fun between the buns ' , was banned in @entity181			0
other comments on @entity126 included ' that 's just sick ' , ' so , so , so appalling ' and ' ca n't believe someone thought this was okay '			0
@entity73 - born @entity4 was shot in the face on a school bus by an extremist @entity8 gunman because she wanted to receive an education , in a horrific crime that shocked the world			1
@entity4 , now 16 , was taken to the @entity192 in @entity193 where she recovered from her injuries			0
the young girl has since released her autobiography , and has received a string of humanitarian awards for her continued activism , including a @entity201 nomination			0
@entity27 claim to the world ’s largest manufacturers and distributors of mattresses and beds , and export their products to several countries including @entity33			2
it is not known whether the mattress firm approved the design			0
several @entity27 representatives did not immediately return requests for comment			0
a spokesman for the @entity33 @entity217 said he could not say whether the advert would be against its guidelines unless it was used in @entity33 and received complaints			2
' the codes are very strict and say adverts should not contain anything which would cause serious or widespread offence , ' he added .			0
