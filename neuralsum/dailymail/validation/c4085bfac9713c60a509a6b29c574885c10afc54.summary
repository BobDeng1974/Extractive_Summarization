after centuries of science and exploration , you might think we know just about all there is to know about the planet we inhabit			0
but in the last year alone , scientists have discovered 1,451 new species in our oceans , according to an international audit of the seas published today			1
the marine creatures include weird and wonderful beasts from the deepest , darkest oceans , microscopic shrimp from coastal caves and even two new types of dolphin			1
marine explorers off the coast of @entity21 discovered the venomous ' @entity23 ' jellyfish last summer – long as a man ’s arm and powerful enough to kill a human			1
and in 2014 biologists identified two new species of dolphin – one found near @entity50 and the other in a @entity53 river – both of which are already threatened by fishermen			1
despite the expansion of our knowledge however , scientists estimate we still only know about a tenth of the marine life on @entity63			1
the @entity65 – which aims to become an inventory of all known ocean life – numbers 228,000 species , with new names being added every day			2
but scientists estimate there could eventually be two million on the list as our knowledge of the oceans grows			1
over the last eight years since the project started , scientists have pored over records , examined historic journals , and poked and prodded the bodies of mysterious creatures of the deep			1
after countless hours of research , they have found we know only a fraction of the fish , whales and sharks swimming around our shores , or the squid and shrimp found in the darkest reaches of our oceans			1
the acceleration in research means four species are being added to the record a day			2
the @entity65 - which aims to become an inventory of all known ocean life - numbers 228,000 species , with new names being added daily			0
pictured : a @entity98 found off @entity99 @entity100 ( pictured ) were among the new discoveries after being found off the coast of @entity103 over the last eight years 122 sharks and rays have been added to the register , along with 131 members of the goby fish family and hundreds of different sponges			2
but experts say we still know little about the waters that make up 70 per cent of the @entity63 ’s surface			0
at the current rate , it would take 360 more years to identify every creature thought to exist in the oceans , the researchers say			0
dr @entity119 , of the @entity120 in @entity121 and co-chairman of the marine register programme , said : ‘ it is humbling to realise that humankind has encountered and described only a fraction of our oceanic kin , perhaps as little as 11 per cent			2
‘ the main gap at the moment is because of the under - exploration of the oceans			2
' there are many , many places we have never been			0
’ but he added : ‘ sadly , we fear , many species will almost certainly disappear due to changing maritime conditions – especially warming , pollution and acidification – before we ’ve had a chance to meet			1
’ ' the knowledge is vital for conservation efforts			0
' without knowing what species are there , we have no way of knowing what is at risk			0
' some discoveries have significant benefits			0
certain varieties of sea sponges , for example , have yielded valuable cancer - fighting agents			0
experts estimate marine life has the potential to create more than 200 potential cancer drugs .			0
