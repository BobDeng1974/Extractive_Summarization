by @entity1 reporter published : 13:40 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 13:40 est , 7 january 2014 tragic : @entity3 , who was found dead at a recycling plant in @entity5 after he fell asleep in a skip in @entity7 and was crushed to death a father - of - one was crushed to death in a bin lorry after climbing into a skip to keep warm and sleep after getting drunk and high on cannabis on a night out , an inquest heard			1
@entity3 , 23 , had got high before going out clubbing and getting drunk in @entity7 , @entity16			1
seeking shelter on his way home , he clambered into a large skip			2
an hour later the bin lorry arrived to collect the skip outside a bus station and mr @entity3 , who had probably fallen asleep , was crushed to death by the vehicle ’s mechanical compressor , @entity21 heard			1
coroner @entity29 recorded a verdict of accidental death related to alcohol and drug use			0
but the family of mr @entity3 , who had a son , @entity35 , aged two , angrily stormed out of court as the verdict was given			2
outside they said the verdict made mr @entity3 look like a ' drug addict ' and during the hearing questioned whether the binmen had first checked the skip for rough - sleepers before it was emptied			1
earlier the inquest heard mr @entity3 , from @entity45 , had smoked four spliffs with his best friend @entity47 before they went out for ' student night ' in @entity7 on january 24 last year			1
there they downed @entity52 bombs in a pub and went to a club where mr @entity3 proudly showed people photos on his phone of his young son before he fell asleep , rowed with bouncers and was eventually thrown out			2
he hung around the town ’s bus station for an hour but it was closed and he was captured on @entity62 staggering around and falling asleep standing up leaning against doors			2
at 4.47am @entity62 captured him climbing on top of the skip , before one hour and one minute later the bin lorry arrived to collect the skip with the contents then compressed by the mechanical crusher on the vehicle			1
later that day the the lorry load was emptied at @entity72 , where the waste was dumped onto a conveyor belt and shocked workers spotted mr @entity3 ’s body			1
@entity77 dr @entity77 , who carried out a post mortem investigation on mr @entity3 , said there were extensive signs typical of asphyxia on his face and body			2
there were also 29 minor injuries on his upper body , mainly grazes and bruises			0
he gave the cause of death as traumatic asphyxia due to the lorry ’s mechanical waste compression crushing his chest			0
toxicology reports showed both alcohol and cannabis in mr @entity3 ’s body , which may have had a ' detrimental effect on his motor and cognitive function ' - but these were also described as ' minimal ' though it may have delayed his response to what was happening when the skip was collected by the bin lorry , dr @entity77 said			1
@entity107 discovery : later that day the the lorry load was emptied at @entity72 , pictured , where the waste was dumped onto a conveyor belt and horrified workers spotted mr @entity3 's lifeless body detective constable @entity113 , from @entity114 said police had found no evidence of criminal action or neglect by either the bus station , recycling firm or bin lorry drivers			1
the case of @entity3 is a tragic repeat of that of a @entity126 student who got drunk on his first night in the @entity127 and was crushed to death in the back of a bin lorry after falling asleep in a giant wheelie bin			1
@entity133 , 22 , drank a dozen drinks with a @entity127 medical student friend he met on a rugby tour just hours after enrolling at the @entity137 , an inquest heard			0
but the following day bin men discovered the body of the masters student when they emptied their lorry at a plant in the outskirts of the city			1
it is thought the student - who was only wearing shorts and a jumper - may have climbed into the large bin outside flats in @entity150 to escape the cold			0
a post-mortem investigation found he may have been suffering hypothermia - made worse by the alcohol he consumed that night			0
but mr @entity3 ’s family questioned whether a visual check of whether anyone was in the skip had taken place			2
his older brother , @entity161 told the inquest : ' i have worked for a bin company , and the rules was if it was a town centre and the early hours in the morning we had to check them because of homeless people			0
' every time we came to a bin we had to check			0
' @entity172 , the bin lorry driver , said he did carry out a visual check of the skip before it was emptied - but it was only possible to see what was on top - not what was within the 8ft long , six feet high skip			1
mr @entity29 , assistant coroner for @entity16 , gave the inquest verdict as death caused by traumatic asphyxia with alcohol and cannabis intoxication as contributory factors			0
' i ’m accepting the evidence derived from @entity62 that at approximately 4.47am @entity187 entered a skip , seeking shelter and a place to sleep , ' he said			0
' @entity187 was , in essence , the architect of his own misfortune on that particular day			0
the conclusion i will be formally recording will be one of accidental death , alcohol and drug related			0
' he said he would be writing to the local council to ' explore the possibility of remedial measures ' for binmen to check skips and bins , especially in winter , for people sleeping inside before they are emptied .			0

@entity3 had smoked cannabis before going drinking in @entity7
the 23 - year - old dad missed his last bus home and sought shelter in a skip
