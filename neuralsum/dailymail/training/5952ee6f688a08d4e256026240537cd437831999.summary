he still remembers how it all began — on a march afternoon in 1991			0
sir @entity2 was in the @entity4 city of @entity5 checking out the accommodation for his @entity8 squad ahead of a big match against the local side			1
‘ would you like lunch ? ’ asked the owner of the @entity12			0
out came his finest wines — a @entity17 and a @entity18 — and sir @entity2 left with the hotelier ’s wise words of advice imprinted in his memory : ‘ invest in ’ 82s and ’ 85s			0
you wo n’t go wrong			0
’ next month former @entity8 boss sir @entity2 will start to sell off a large part of his wine collection - some 5,000 bottles in total			1
they are expected to reach more than £ 3 million at auction and he did n’t			1
because now , more than 20 years later , the most successful football manager of our times is about to make ( yet another ) small fortune as a connoisseur of fine wine			1
next month , sir @entity2 will start selling off a large part of his collection — some 5,000 bottles in total ( all red , needless to say )			1
and the guide price ? an extremely ripe and fruity £ 3 million			1
now , admittedly , in current footballing terms , this might buy you only one leg of a half - decent defender			2
but , since that works out at an average of £ 600 a bottle — or £ 100 a glass — it ’s a heck of a lot for a drop of wine			1
and the industry experts have little doubt that many of these wines will go for well above the asking price when they go under the hammer at three @entity63 ’s sales — one in @entity65 , one in @entity66 and one online			1
for the guide prices , based on market rates , do not include the added premium of the @entity2 brand , still as strong as ever one year on from his retirement			0
sir @entity2 began collecting wines in 1991 after visiting @entity5 to check out the accommodation for his squad ahead of a @entity8 fixture for example , the star lots include a half - case ( six bottles ) of @entity81 1999 , valued at £ 50,000 - £ 65,000 ( £ 8,300 to £ 10,800 a bottle )			1
@entity83 is extremely hard to come by			0
very little is produced each year , it is the darling of the @entity86 region and 1999 was one of the best vintages of all time			0
it was also a vintage year for sir @entity2 as his team achieved the magical ‘ treble ’ — winning the @entity92 , the @entity93 and the @entity94			0
and whoever buys this lot will also get a 1999 @entity8 @entity92 shirt signed by the man himself			1
that might be of limited interest to the grandees of the @entity104 ’s wine trade ( for whom the name ‘ @entity106 ’ has a different meaning )			2
but it will have huge appeal in @entity111 , where @entity8 are revered as the greatest team in the world			1
those half a dozen bottles could easily reach six figures when the hammer falls			2
looking through the catalogue of more than 400 lots , it is clear that sir @entity2 was as canny with his wine as with his footballers			2
‘ this is a great time to be selling @entity86 — people are mad about it — and a bad time to be selling @entity127 , ’ says @entity122 , founding partner of @entity66 ’s @entity123			1
sure enough , three quarters of the @entity2 collection consists of @entity86 — most of it from that same highly - prized @entity83 estate			1
but sir @entity2 was judicious , too , in his choice of @entity127			0
for , while the market for many grand old clarets has crashed , it remains extremely strong for @entity17			0
and , guess what ? sir @entity2 has bucketloads of that			0
‘ @entity17 is an iconic wine made in small quantities with a very strong following , ’ explains @entity139 , @entity63 ’s head of wine			2
he describes sir @entity2 as ‘ a very sophisticated collector ’ and says a sale of this magnitude might come around only two or three times a year			0
to see just how shrewd sir @entity2 has been , i consult @entity149 , the @entity66 - based global stock market for fine wine sales which can track the price of every wine from release to the present day			1
some of these wines are worth 30 times what sir @entity2 paid for them			0
many of his burgundies are at an all - time high			2
staff at @entity63 auction house show off a bottle of @entity17 , one of 12 to go under the hammer			0
a retro @entity8 @entity92 shirt will also be up for grabs when the three separate sales take place , one in @entity66 , another in @entity65 and the last online any bargains ? sir @entity2 does n’t do bargains			1
if you ’re lucky , you might pick up a case of @entity176 2009 for under £ 1,000 ( with a signed catalogue thrown in )			2
sir @entity2 ’s drinking days are far from over			0
he still has plenty of wine , he says , in the cellar of his @entity183 home and keeps rather more in a bonded warehouse in an old @entity186 bunker in @entity187			2
he can also take the credit for introducing a post-match ritual among the top flight of football management — sharing a bottle of fine wine with the opposition			2
@entity201 ’s @entity200 , he notes , ‘ has some decent wines ’ and former @entity199 manager , @entity195 would always produce a decent @entity196			0
not so the management at @entity203 whom he puts at the bottom of the wine appreciation league			2
‘ @entity203 were n’t very good			0
i had to remind them that they should have better wine			2
’ it ’s been an extraordinary journey , not just on the pitch but in the glass			0
and for that , he can thank the @entity12			0
so what happened after that life - changing lunch ? sir @entity2 ’s team duly thumped @entity5 2 - 0 , went all the way to the final and won the @entity218			2
six bottles of @entity83 1999 estimate : £ 50,000 - £ 65,000 ( £ 8,300 - £ 10,800 a bottle )			1
original price : £ 2,150 a @entity225 transfer deal ? 400 per cent @entity222 notes : ‘ perhaps the rarest and most sought - after wine			1
ripe fruit , intense fragrance			0
’ fergie factor : best season of his career			0
the club became the first to win the treble of the @entity92 , the @entity93 and the @entity94			0
six bottles of @entity83 1999 ( centre ) are among the lots up for auction			2
they are expected to fetch upwards of £ 50,000 or between £ 8,300 and £ 10,800 per bottle twelve bottles of @entity244 : £ 11,500 - £ 13,800 ( £ 950 - £ 1,150 per bottle ) original price : £ 750 ( £ 62.50 per bottle ) @entity249 transfer deal ? 1,800 per cent @entity222 notes : ‘ generally ripe and quite exotic			1
full flavoured and with intense black fruit taste			0
’ fergie factor : an inconsequential season			0
@entity8 ended as @entity253 runners - up to arch - rivals @entity252 and suffered an embarrassing @entity255 exit at the hands of @entity257			1
an ‘ imperiale ’ - eight bottles in one - of @entity260 1986 with label signed by sir @entity263 : £ 7,000 - £ 10,000original price : £ 350canny transfer deal ? 2,700 per cent @entity222 notes : ‘ elegant and finely flavoured			1
@entity260 of a great vintage is always subtle , austere and quite dry			0
’ fergie factor : a very important football vintage — 1986 was the year sir @entity2 arrived at @entity8			1
twelve bottles of @entity271 valued at between £ 11,500 and £ 13,800 ( left ) and a signed imperiale - eight bottles in one - of @entity260 1986 , valued at £ 7,000 t0 £ 10,000 will go up for auction an imperiale of @entity275 2005 with label signed by sir @entity263 : £ 2,700 - £ 3,500original price : £ 3,500canny transfer deal ? lucky to break @entity278 notes : ‘ earthy and peppery			1
’ fergie factor : no need to raise a glass			0
third in the league , no trophies and @entity8 were nearly knocked out of the @entity94 by non-league @entity285			1
an imperiale of @entity288 with label signed by sir @entity290 : £ 770 - £ 920original price : £ 1,000canny transfer deal ? not his @entity294 notes : ‘ dense flavours of ripe fruit and warm @entity300 sun. ’ @entity2 factor : only the @entity255 to brighten the trophy cabinet			1
@entity8 came second in the @entity92 , well behind @entity203 , after a disastrous @entity303 campaign in which they failed to reach the knock - out stage			1
an imperiale of @entity275 2005 ( left ) will be auctioned next month , and is expected to fetch around £ 3,500			1
another imperiale , of @entity288 is expected to sell for upwards of £ 900			0
