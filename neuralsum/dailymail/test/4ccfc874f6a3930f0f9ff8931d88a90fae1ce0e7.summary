@entity0 said his @entity2 team ‘ bamboozled ’ @entity3 and paid particular tribute to @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 , the teenager who shone on his @entity9 debut			1
@entity2 earned a comeback win to book their place in the @entity13 final against @entity14 and end @entity16 ’s dream of lifting the famous old trophy on his birthday before bidding farewell to the club			1
@entity0 was dealt a blow by @entity23 ’s failure to overcome a hamstring injury , but adapted his plans to brilliant effect as @entity3 struggled to cope with @entity2 ’s fluid attack			1
@entity5 is congratulated by @entity2 team - mate @entity6 after scoring at @entity9 the @entity2 manager said : ‘ we changed the way we played			1
we normally go very direct , and use our pace down the sides , i think @entity3 would have expected us to do that			1
‘ but we played it short through the thirds and caused some problems in the little pockets of areas			0
they were a little bit bamboozled to be honest			0
‘ we needed to create a threat			0
i ’m not sure @entity3 tried to second - guess what we were going to do but i do n’t think they would have expected that			1
’ ‘ we looked @entity3 and thought it might cause them a few problems if we played two @entity47 with @entity7 and @entity48 and it turned out that way			1
they got them on the back foot			0
‘ we needed to get players in support of @entity5			1
i thought our game plan worked perfectly			2
we were n’t worried about what @entity3 were going to do			1
we just knew if we played like we can we were going to cause them a lot of problems			0
’ @entity61 conceded his side had been second best , but praised captain @entity16 , who had a late header cleared off the line			1
@entity2 players chase @entity6 after the @entity67 midfielder made it 2 - 1 with 36 minutes left on the clock ‘ he was doing everything , everything he possibly could to help the team , ’ said the @entity3 boss			1
‘ i thought he was excellent			0
but collectively we did n't perform well enough to get a victory			0
’ @entity0 kept faith with @entity75 , the 19 - year - old academy graduate , after handing him his first @entity78 start against @entity79 a fortnight ago			1
he did not disappoint , playing a part in @entity5 ’s equaliser , then setting up @entity6 ’s winner			1
‘ the bigger the stage the better he plays , the more he relishes it , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ that ’s the sign of a good talent			0
@entity7 ’s someone i looked at before i was at the club and when i ’ve seen him in training , if you give him an instruction he sticks to the plan			0
he ’s got a big future at the football club			0
’ @entity6 and team - mate @entity95 celebrate their @entity13 win over @entity3 at @entity9 @entity7 , who wears children ’s shinpads and socks rolled down , won two free - kicks for his team through dribbling with the ball			1
‘ he ’s very durable , ’ added @entity0			2
‘ you should see the size of his legs , he ’s still a kid , he ’s still learning			0
he takes more kicks in training than he does on the pitch so he ’ s getting a lot of practice fending off those kicks – he probably needs bigger pads ! ’ @entity5 scored his ninth goal in seven games to level @entity116 ’s opening goal , before @entity6 found the net for the second time under @entity0 , following his quarter - final goal against @entity120			1
he failed to score under @entity121 this season			0
‘ when i came to the club @entity6 had just signed a new contract , he had an opportunity to go to some of the teams in the top four			2
he showed a lot of loyalty to @entity2			2
i need characters like that , who put themselves on the line , show that spirit			0
@entity3 playmaker @entity136 is mobbed by his team - mates after opening the scoring ‘ i ’ve never seen him have a bad game here at @entity9 for @entity67 and he ’s not had a bad one today , so hopefully he plays well in the final			1
‘ he can add goals to his game , he has so much energy he can get into the final third and score			2
he ’s nicked a couple of goals for me already			0
i just want to encourage him to do that and then he ’ll be too expensive for anyone to buy ! ’ on @entity5 , @entity0 added : ‘ he ’s done that consistently for me			1
when i first come in i could n’t believe they ’d only scored 12 goals with that strike force			0
i saw something wrong and viewed the tapes and saw they were n’t getting the service			0
’ @entity136 spreads his arms out wide after scoring during his side 's surprise @entity13 defeat @entity0 praised @entity2 ’s 32,000 fans and turned his attention to @entity14			1
it ’s easy to support your team when they ’re winning but even at 1 - 0 down i thought they were great and dragged the boys back			0
‘ i watched the other semi-final yesterday and i saw how calm @entity167 was after the game			2
but he probably realises there ’s nothing won			0
‘ i ’m sorry i ca n’t be @entity167 after that final whistle , i was just delighted and i had to spill out them emotions			2
‘ we ’ll be the underdogs , the pressure is on @entity14 , they ’re the holders and they ’ll want to win it again			2
we realise we ’ve got a lot of hard work between now and then to secure our @entity78 safety and then come back here and take the game to @entity14			0
’ @entity5 leaps in the air after levelling the scoreline by hitting the back of the net in the 36th minute			2
