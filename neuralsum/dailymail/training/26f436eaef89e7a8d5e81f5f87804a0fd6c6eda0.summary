she was originally contracted to work 12 hours a week and for the past ten years had worked mornings only on wednesdays , thursdays and friday			1
but she claims she was asked to work every other weekend , perform early and late shifts and be available for work five days out of seven on a four week rota basis			1
mrs @entity10 claims this was indirect age discrimination because she is being asked to work hours most people her age would not usually be able to work			1
she is also exempt from working sundays as a ' protected shop worker ' but the new shifts put to her stated she would have to work a minimum of every other weekend			1
because she has been employed by the same employer continuously since before 26 august 1994 she is a protected shop worker - which means she can opt out of working sundays			2
she alleges she was told that if she did not agree to the new terms of her working shifts she would be sacked			1

the claim form reads : ‘ it was put to her that if she was not prepared to agree to these changes the @entity50 would move to terminate her employment ’			0
mrs @entity10 , of @entity53 , @entity26 , said she was devastated at no longer having the job she believes has helped keep her going			2
she said : ' i loved working there and i miss it badly			2
i ’m worried i ’ll vegetate if i sit at home doing nothing			0
' it ’s strange not working			0
bosses at the company , which made £ 161m profit last year , forced her to leave after unfairly changing her shift pattern , she claims ' i ’ve worked all my life , for 64 years , and spent more than 30 years with the civil service before i joined @entity6			1
' i was n’t ready to be retired			0
i ’m still fit and healthy and i had planned to carry on working for as long as i could			0
' i always said i ’d stop when i got too tired to carry on			0
but the fact is that i ’m not tired yet			0
' lawyer @entity69 , from @entity70 , said : ' i think what the company did to mrs @entity10 was absolutely awful			2
' she gave her all to @entity6 for almost 25 years and she did not deserve to be treated in such a way			1
' they are asking her to work hours people her age are usually unable to work			2
' she feels they have unfairly changed her shift patterns and discriminating against her because of her age			0
' the way she has been treated is utterly shocking			0
' a spokesman for @entity6 said : ' @entity6 is proud of its track record on employing older people , almost 30 per cent of our 33,000 employees are over 50 years old and our oldest employee is 89 years old			1
' we would never comment on an individual case and as this is an ongoing legal process it is not appropriate to comment further			0
