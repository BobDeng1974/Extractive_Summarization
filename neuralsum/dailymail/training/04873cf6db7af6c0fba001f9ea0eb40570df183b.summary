@entity0 launched an extraordinary attack on @entity3 supporters this week and claimed the players are no longer made to feel welcome at @entity5			1
the striker , who took an extra minute to come on as a substitute in the 2 - 1 defeat by @entity9 because he decided to change his boots when he was waiting to get on , insists the atmosphere is negative			1
we asked @entity13 , editor of the @entity14 , for his views on @entity0 's comments			2
@entity0 is the worst possible @entity3 player to criticise @entity3 fans			1
but that ’s not to say the striker does n’t have a point			0
@entity3 striker @entity0 launched a scathing attack on the @entity3 supporters this week @entity0 said players would rather be away from home after fans opted to boo during the defeat to @entity9 the attacked may have a point about the @entity3 support but it 's not what supporters want to hear even when he was scoring under @entity34 and saluting under @entity35 , fans could never fully embrace @entity0			1
he scored against @entity3 too often for @entity36 and is , unfairly in my opinion , viewed as more of a mercenary than other players in the @entity3 squad			2
there ’s also a feeling – again unfair and perpetuated by tv pundits – that a player earning so much cash should always be performing better			0
with one or two exceptions , the entire squad has been abysmal under @entity49 but @entity50 is often singled out , slammed for his ' lazy ' , ' feckless ' displays ahead of other more popular players , who are just as deserving of criticism			0
it ’s therefore no surprise @entity50 ’s claim that the squad is afraid to play at home because of the negative atmosphere has ruffled some feathers			1
@entity3 have been abysmal under new boss @entity49 and were embarrassed by @entity9 @entity9 frontman @entity60 scored the @entity62 ' second as they clinched all three points in north @entity64 @entity0 tried his luck with a late header against @entity9 but it was n't to be for the @entity3 striker fans have rightly pointed out that @entity50 has been rubbish away from home this season , where @entity3 arguably have the best fans in the country			1
supporters will not take kindly to criticism from a player who is clearly not performing to the best of his ability but , rightly or wrongly , @entity0 was named vice-captain by @entity49 and it ’s now his responsibility to speak on behalf of the squad			2
if his comments had come from @entity88 ’s other deputy , @entity89 , or even from one of the young , homegrown players , the reaction would have been different			0
@entity92 defender @entity88 leads out his @entity3 team at @entity5 ahead of @entity89 and even some of @entity0 ’s critics will have read his remarks and nodded in resigned agreement			1
there is consensus among @entity3 fans that the atmosphere at the @entity5 is on the decline , which is why the wonderful 1882 movement and others are growing in importance			1
fortunately , i did n’t attend the @entity9 match but by all accounts the @entity107 began as edgy and turned outright poisonous after @entity9 ’s opener			2
watching on tv , there was an obvious absence of @entity3 players showing for the ball and ‘ afraid ’ would be an appropriate way to describe the shambolic performance			1
whether this is primarily a result of @entity49 ’s instructions or the atmosphere is unclear , but negatively from the terraces can hardly have helped the players			0
the @entity3 players jump in unison during the warm up , but were beaten by the @entity62 the @entity3 supporters ( pictured observing a minute 's silence ) turned up in their droves to watch the defeat fans will point out that they have a right to boo @entity131 when they do n’t appear to be giving their all			1
but @entity0 ’s introduction on sunday was , disgustingly , booed before he had a chance to kick a ball			2
paying fans have the right to express dissatisfaction in this way but it ’s a bit like the right to freedom of expression ; we have it , but we should n’t use it to be a total fool			0
@entity5 remains a fabulous old - fashioned football ground and when it ’s rocking , there is nowhere better , for me , in the entire country			2
the current negativity is undoubtedly a chicken and egg situation and if the players show more , the fans will respond			0
but that ’s not to say @entity3 fans are entirely blameless for the club ’s current struggles			0
@entity0 has made a good point			0
we just do n’t want to hear it from him			0
