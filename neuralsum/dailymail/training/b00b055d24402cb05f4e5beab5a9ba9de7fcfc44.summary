by @entity0 a young girl who was raped by two boys she was playing @entity3 with was subjected to a tirade on online abuse accusing her of ' asking for it ' and ' lying ' about the assaults			1
the girl , from @entity9 , south @entity10 , was just ten when she was raped by boys aged 12 and 13 as they played the @entity13 computer game together			1
the boys , who are too young to be named , were sentenced at @entity14 last month , and the girl 's 35 - year - old mother hoped to rebuild her daughter 's shattered life			1
online abuse : after two boys were sentenced for raping a ten - year - old , she was accused of ' asking for it ' but soon after the sentencing - the boys avoided jail because of their age - a family friend of one of the boys wrote on @entity30 that the young victim ' asked for it '			1
a stream of abuse then followed , with one troller accusing the girl of crying rape when she had consented , and another saying it was her fault			1
the girl 's mother went to police but they told her they were n't able to help , and told her to talk to @entity30 , who told her the comments did n't breach their ' community standards '			1
the facebook page had nearly 200 comments on it by the time the girl 's mother contacted the person who set it up and persuaded them to take it down			1
last year she had had to cope with similar harassment after the mother of one of the boys posted the victim 's name and address on @entity30			1
she later took it down after police intervened			2
today the girl 's mother spoke of the nightmare she and her daughter have lived through since the boys were arrested over the rape last august			1
she told the @entity68 : ' i thought that after the guilty verdict in court we would get our lives back , but it has got worse			0
' it is heart - breaking for my daughter - she is a prisoner here			0
' judge @entity78 , left , did n't send the boys to jail but gave them curfews and tags instead - @entity85 mp @entity84 , right , has called the sentences ' pathetic ' and asked the attorney general to review them last month , the boys , who are both now 14 and were found guilty of rape after denying the offence , were given tags for three months and put under a curfew			1
they were also given rehabilitation orders with intense supervision			0
judge @entity78 told them : ' this is a very serious offence			0
had you been adults you would have been looking at a lengthy custodial sentence			0
' today the victims ' mother criticised the boys ' sentences as ' pathetic ' , a cause local @entity103 mp @entity84 has taken up			2
he has written to the attorney general asking for the boys ' sentences to be reconsidered			0
' i 'm absolutely appalled at the way this girl has been treated both in her community and by the judicial system , ' mr @entity84 said			0
and he expressed his disgust at what he called the ' sickening campaign of persecution ' the girl and her family had suffered			2
a spokesman for @entity119 said that the online comments about the girl were not criminal so they had no grounds to take action			1
they said : ' we endeavour to give victims of crime and their families all the support they need to live their lives safely and securely			0
' in this case we were made aware of some comments which appeared on a @entity30 page			1
officers visited the home of the victim and viewed the comments , which whilst distasteful , were not criminal in nature			2
' officers had no grounds to take formal action and in good faith suggested the victim take the matter up directly with @entity30			2
' we continue to support the family , and an officer has been dedicated to discuss and deal with any concerns they may			0
' a spokesman for the @entity149 told @entity150 : ' our case was clear that this was rape and the jury convicted for rape			0
' a @entity30 spokesman admitted the posts should have been taken down as implying a minor can consent to or ask for sex did breach their standards			2
they said : ' we encourage people to report things that they find offensive so we can investigate and remove if it breaks our rules			0
' unfortunately we do nâ€™t always get it right and on this occasion we should have removed the group			0
we are sorry for any upset or distress this may have caused			0
