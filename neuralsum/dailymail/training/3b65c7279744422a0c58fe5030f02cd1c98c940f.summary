i do n't know of anyone else making didgeridoos around here			2

' mr @entity38 first realised he could make a business of selling his creations after he moved to the @entity104			1
the father - of - four started making didgeridoos in the 70s as a hobby and it progressed from there into a business			2

i had to learn how to make them in tune , which took about three years			0
the thing about bamboo is that no two pieces are the same , so you have to get to know the material to get the tuning right			0
' i make my didgeridoos with bamboo , which is a lovely material ; it 's very resonant and easier to play than a hardwood didgeridoo , which would be made out of eucalyptus in @entity12			1
' versatile : talented musician @entity8 claims the didgeridoo is one of the easiest instruments to play he has visited the instrument 's native land and says his versions measure up to the originals			1
