the dawn of a new era of space travel may be upon us after @entity5 's @entity4 successfully tested a vehicle that will take tourists into space			1
mr @entity4 ' firm , called the @entity11 company , has long spoken of its desire to take paying astronauts into the cosmos			1
and now it has performed the first successful test of the vehicle they hope will make that dream a reality			1
the @entity26 vehicle rose to a height of 58 miles ( 94km ) - four miles short of space - before landing			1
it was unmanned , but will ultimately take six people into space the test took place from the company ’s launch site in @entity24			1
called @entity26 , the vehicle consists of a main booster rocket and a six - seater capsule on top , standing 60ft ( 18 metres ) tall			1
the @entity26 system will take astronauts to space on suborbital journeys			1
it includes a @entity44 carrying six astronauts atop a separate rocket - powered @entity46 , launched from the firm 's @entity48			0
following liftoff , the combined vehicles accelerate for approximately two and a half minutes			0
the @entity46 then shuts off its rocket engines and separates from the @entity44			0
the @entity46 will finish its flight , descend to @entity54 , and autonomously perform a rocket - powered vertical landing			2
the @entity44 will go on to coast to the edge of space , providing astronauts with a view to the curvature of the @entity54 and the beauty of our planet			0
after descent and re-entry into @entity54 ’s atmosphere , the @entity44 will land under parachutes no more than a few miles from the launch site			1
in addition , the @entity26 vehicle will provide opportunities for researchers to fly experiments into space and a microgravity environment			1
for this , the first test flight of the entire architecture , it was unmanned - but the company hopes to soon start taking customers into space			1
the cost of a ticket has not yet been announced , but estimates suggest it will be around £ 130,000 $ 200,000 - similar to a flight on @entity90 ’s @entity89			0
the difference , however , is that while @entity89 relies on using a plane to slowly rise into the atmosphere , @entity26 takes off straight up and lands back on the ground			2
this is known as vertical takeoff , vertical landing ( @entity98 )			0
and @entity11 is also much more secretive - with this successful test flight taking many by surprise			1
in video released by @entity11 , the booster - using liquid hydrogen and oxygen - lifts the @entity26 vehicle to an altitude of 58 miles ( 94km )			1
this is four miles ( six kilometres ) short of the official boundary of space - the @entity108 - although there does not seem to be any problems with reaching this boundary in future			2
once it reached its peak altitude , accelerating at @entity115 , the booster separated from the capsule			0
‘ the in - space separation of the crew capsule from the propulsion module was perfect , ’ mr @entity117 said in a blog post			0
‘ any astronauts on board would have had a very nice journey into space and a smooth return			0
’ the flight came as somewhat of a surprise because the company did n't make any announcements in the build up that it would be launching a rocket - unlike its rivals @entity89 and @entity133 who are very open about the tests they will be performing at peak altitude , 307,000ft ( 58 miles , 94km ) up , the main booster separated from the capsule			1
on the left , the booster can be seen falling away , while on the right a distant view of the separation is seen			0
the booster failed to land successfully but the capsule landed without a hitch ultimately , the flights will enable six people to go to space			1
while in space , huge windows will give the customers a stunning view of @entity54 ( artist 's impression shown ) , and they 'll also have several minutes of weightlessness , before the capsule falls to @entity54 and lands using parachutes here the capsule is seen returning to @entity54 on this test flight with its three parachutes			2
‘ any astronauts on board would have had a very nice journey into space and a smooth return , ' @entity5 's @entity4 said in a blog post announcing the successful flight the booster is designed to be able to land on the ground and be reusable , much like rival @entity133 ’s own reusable rocket system			2
on this occasion , however , the booster lost pressure in its hydraulic system and was not recovered			0
mr @entity4 said the firm was already working on an improved system to make sure the error does n’t happen again			0
‘ assembly of propulsion module serial numbers 2 and 3 is already underway - we ’ll be ready to fly again soon , ’ he said			0
in a video a small crowd was seen watching the successful flight from the company 's launch site in @entity24 - but for the most part the launch was kept a secret @entity4 ( pictured ) is better known as the ceo and founder of @entity5 , with a fortune of £ 22.5 billion ( $ 34.7 billion )			1
he founded his @entity11 company in 2000 @entity193 , the @entity194 co-founder and electric car maker , is competing against @entity4 to develop a re-usable rocket an isolated edge of vast @entity24 is home to a highly secretive part of the 21st - century space race , one of two being directed in the @entity201 by internet billionaires whose personalities and corporate strategies seem worlds apart			1
the presence of @entity209 , the brainchild of @entity5 founder @entity4 , barely registers in nearby @entity211 , a way station along @entity212 , a full decade after he began buying land in one of @entity24 ' largest and most remote counties			2
at the opposite end — of @entity24 and the competition — is the highly visible @entity133 venture , led by @entity194 co-founder and electric car maker @entity193			2
his company contracts with @entity222 to resupply the @entity223 and is building a launch site about 600 miles from @entity211 , on the southernmost @entity225 , with the much - publicized goal of sending humans to @entity228			1
@entity133 and @entity11 are among several @entity230 companies engaged in the private space business			1
both men have seemingly unlimited resources — @entity4 ' wealth is estimated at nearly $ 35 billion , @entity193 's at $ 12 billion — and lofty aspirations : launching a new era of commercial space operations , in part by cutting costs through reusable rockets			0
earlier this year a dispute over a design of a floating landing platform - which would be used to launch and land rockets in the middle of the ocean - was dragged through the courts			2
but a judge said the confrontation would be allowed to continue			0
in part they are racing to be the first to manufacture and successfully operate reusable rockets - making space flight cheaper			0
according to the @entity254 , @entity133 has been working on the technology for years , and in january attempted the unprecedented landing the first stage of its @entity259 rocket on a floating barge it calls an autonomous spaceport droneship			0
however the barge and the rocket exploded			0
@entity133 founder and @entity193 , center , and @entity24 governor @entity265 turn the first shovel - full of sand at the groundbreaking ceremony for the @entity133 launch pad at @entity272 , @entity24 , in september 2014 combined , the booster and capsule stand 60ft ( 18 metres ) tall , with a feather painted onto the side this is the walkway astronauts will ultimately use when the company stars its manned flights in this first test flight , the @entity26 vehicle rose to an altitude of 58 miles ( 94km )			1
this is four miles ( six kilometres ) short of the official boundary of space - the @entity108 - although there does not seem to be any problems with reaching this boundary in future the flight of the capsule , however , passed without a hitch and it successfully landed on the ground with the help of three parachutes			2
the company is keen on @entity98 because it is ‘ scalable to a very large size , ’ according to mr @entity4			0
and he noted that the company was already working on a larger vehicle , @entity26 ’s ‘ very @entity300 ’ , which is apparently many times @entity26 ’s size with five times as much thrust			1
the company has not yet revealed when it ’s next flight will be , or when manned flights will begin			0
' we wo n’t be publishing a calendar for our test flight programme			0
and , nothing further to contribute regarding pricing , ' a spokesperson from @entity11 told @entity314			2
but following this successful flight , many will be expecting the company to go from strength to strength .			2

his @entity11 company completed a successful test in @entity24
the @entity26 vehicle rose to a height of 58 miles before landing
it was unmanned but will ultimately take six people into space
the launch was conducted in secrecy before being released to the public
