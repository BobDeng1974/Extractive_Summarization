despite a collection of seemingly racist rants about ' negros , ' slavery and ' picking cotton , ' not everyone thinks @entity7 rancher @entity6 is a racist , and one of the people defending the one - time far - right - wing folk hero is one of his bodyguards - who happens to be black			1
@entity13 has been at @entity6 's side since his battle with the federal government began heating up in late march			1
according to @entity18 , the man he 's come to know over the last month is not a racist			1
in fact , @entity18 says he would take a bullet for @entity6			1

how does that strike you ? ' ' it does n't strike me any kind of way , ' @entity18 answered			2
' this is still the same old mr. @entity6 i met from the first day of all this happening			2
' @entity18 says the things @entity6 has been saying - ' wondering ' if ' negros ' were better off under slavery , and comparing himself to civil rights hero @entity46 , for example - do n't offend him			1
' mr. @entity6 is not a racist			2
ever since i 've been here he 's treated me with nothing but hospitality , ' @entity18 told the reporter			2

' he goes on to say that ' i would take a bullet for that man , if need be , ' and that he ' look ( s ) up to him just like i do my grandfather			0
' the cause : @entity18 says he believes in @entity6 's cause , which is why he is willing to give his life to defend him ' i believe in his cause and after having met mr. @entity6 a few times , i have a really good feel about him and i 'm a pretty good judge of character , ' @entity18 said			1
however , @entity6 's racist rants have led to public outcry and political allies distancing themselves - but @entity6 does n't see what all the fuss is about , claiming he is just like @entity46 and ' standing up against laws which destroy our freedom '			1
@entity6 has become something of a celebrity in his frontier , @entity7 stronghold since his showdown over cattle - grazing land with federal authorities earlier this month			1
he was quickly upheld as a hero by the right with senator @entity83 dubbing him a ' patriot '			0
however , that reputation is now in tatters after @entity6 's series of racist rants - and it appears he just ca n't help fanning the flames with further remarks			1
on friday , he invoked the heroic actions of @entity46 , the civil rights icon who was arrested in 1955 after refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man in @entity96 , @entity97			2
her actions sparked the @entity99 and were a defining moment of the civil rights ' movement			0

just like the @entity119 at @entity120 , we are saying no to an oppressive government which considers us to be slaves rather than free men			2
' i invite all people in @entity124 to join in our peaceful revolution to regain our freedom			2
that is how @entity124 was started , and we need to keep that tradition alive			0
' @entity6 earlier said that if people were offended by his use of the word ' negro ' or ' slave ' then ' @entity128 has n't got his job done yet '			2
the @entity136 father of 14 told @entity30 : ' if i say @entity138 or black boy or slave , if those people can not take those kind of words and not be ( offended ) , then @entity128 has n't got his job done yet ...			1
we need to get over this prejudice stuff			0
' later in the rambling interview , he whipped off his cowboy boot and said : ' i did n't want to put my foot in my mouth with the boot on			0

they did n’t have nothing for their kids to do			0
they did n’t have nothing for their young girls to do			0
' and because they were basically on government subsidy , so now what do they do ? they abort their young children , they put their young men in jail , because they never learned how to pick cotton			1
and i ’ve often wondered , are they better off as slaves , picking cotton and having a family life and doing things , or are they better off under government subsidy ? they did n’t get no more freedom			2
