fined : @entity1 has agreed to pay a $ 100 million ( Â£ 62.4m ) fine to the @entity2 and admit its traders engaged in reckless behaviour during the @entity6 trading debacle in 2012 the episode has proven to be one that just about every regulator the bank deals with has wanted to investigate and levy fines			1
the @entity29 , even after filing criminal charges against two former @entity1 traders who allegedly helped conceal the losses , is still investigating whether to bring any action against the bank			0

crisis : @entity40 ceo @entity39 ( pictured in 2009 ) was dubbed the @entity41 of @entity42 but has seen his reputation tarnished by the debacle the settlement with the @entity2 comes as @entity1 continues to deal with regulators and @entity9 authorities on a number of fronts			1
the bank is the middle of trying to negotiate a global settlement with federal prosecutors over its role in the packaging and selling of faulty mortgage - backed securities that could result in a potential $ 11 billion settlement			0
on friday , @entity1 announced it has set aside up to $ 23 billion in reserves to pay for all its potential legal bills to come			0
the @entity2 , in its case , charged the bank with violating a prohibition on manipulative conduct when it traded in the credit default swaps that the bank had built an outsized exposure to by early 2012 and then needed to quickly exit to try to minimize the losses			2
by selling a huge volume of swaps in a concentrated period , the bank 's traders ' recklessly disregarded ' the principle that legitimate market forces should set prices , the @entity2 said			1

the agency previously had to prove a defendant intended to engage in manipulate conduct , a bar so high that the commission was able to bring few cases under it			0
