do n't blame me : @entity1 last night said that @entity6 was at fault for political gridlock villain ? mr @entity1 said many @entity26 politicians were scared of mr @entity6 's influence the president , currently under pressure over issues such as @entity31 and the @entity32 , addressed three @entity9 fund - raising events in @entity34 last night			1
at a dinner party for 60 donors at the @entity38 home of producer @entity39 , mr @entity1 revealed how he had been repeatedly frustrated in his attempts to find common ground with @entity26 in @entity42			1
' what 's blocking us right now is sort of hyper - partisanship in @entity4 that , frankly , i was hoping to overcome in 2008 , ' he said			0
' and in the midst of crisis , i think the other party reacted , rather than saying now is the time for us all to join together , decided to take a different path			0
' my thinking was after we beat them in 2012 , well , that might break the fever , and it 's not quite broken yet			2
' but i am persistent			0
and i am staying at it			0
and i genuinely believe that there are actually @entity26 out there who would like to work with us but they 're fearful of their base and they 're concerned about what @entity6 might say about them			1
