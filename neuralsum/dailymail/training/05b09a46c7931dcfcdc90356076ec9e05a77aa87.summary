rake - thin : @entity1 in flat cap and jeans , rock star @entity0 steps out for lunch in @entity5 late morning on a bustling pavement in one of @entity10 ’s artier districts this week , a rake - thin man ambled along , a serene presence amid his frenetic surroundings			1
wearing a flat cap , wraparound sunglasses , a tatty , grey hooded top and carrying his lunch in a paper bag , he went largely unnoticed by the moneyed shoppers browsing the windows of the art galleries that line the street			1
it is an anonymity that @entity0 has increasingly come to love			2
while it is six years since his last public performance , the once prolific star has apparently not written a song since 2003			1
even more surprising , perhaps , his wife , @entity30 - born model @entity29 , recently let slip that @entity0 has quietly dropped his famous adopted stage name in favour of the one he was born with — plain @entity0			1
increasingly reclusive and consumed by a fear of flying that was only made worse by the 9/11 attacks on @entity5 , the @entity38 - born singer now rarely leaves his adopted home city			1
his days revolve around the £ 4 million loft apartment in the trendy @entity43 district , with its secure ‘ panic room ’ where his family can lock themselves should intruders break in			2
@entity0 spends his time painting , drawing and reading , and other than when he ’s walking his 11 - year - old daughter , @entity53 , to her nearby school , emerges only infrequently			1
he turned down a plea to appear at the @entity56 this year , despite his song heroes becoming the @entity58 ’ unofficial anthem			1
last month he made a rare public comment via @entity61 to deny involvement in a retrospective of his clothes and memorabilia for a major exhibition at the @entity67 in @entity38 next spring			1
@entity0 has offered the museum more than 60 iconic stage outfits , but curators of the much - vaunted show admit they have not even met him			1
increasingly , he will leave his flat only to search for 20th - century art in local galleries , or browse the shelves of the nearby fashionable bookshop @entity76			2
change of style : @entity0 , left , wearing a tatty , grey hooded top and wraparound sunglasses in @entity5 last week and , right , as @entity80 in the @entity81 low key : since having surgery in 2004 after collapsing backstage at a gig due to a clogged artery , @entity0 has stayed out of the spotlight blending in : @entity0 was just one of the crowd as he walked unrecognised no more @entity80 : wearing a hooded sweatshirt , jeans , and a grey flat cap with sunglasses , the only hint of his once legendary dress sense was a zebra print scarf tied around his neck little wonder his closest associates now openly say @entity0 has retired for good from a music world that still fetes him as one of its greatest and most individual talents			1
when the singer turned 65 in january , fans including @entity103 and comedian @entity104 joined an online forum begging him to make a long - awaited return			1
so far , the silence from @entity0 has been deafening			0
the blog he once wrote on his personal website has not been updated since @entity111 was notably absent in march when a plaque was erected in @entity38 to honour @entity80 , his one - time musical alter ego			1
it marked 40 years since @entity0 had posed outside 23 heddon street in @entity115 for the cover of his seminal concept album , @entity80			2
rarely seen : @entity0 , pictured with a female companion in @entity5 , turned down a plea to appear at the @entity56 @entity0 turned down an offer to attend the ceremony , and it was left to another of his celebrity fans , @entity124 of @entity125 , to do the unveiling			1
@entity0 ’s biographer @entity127 told me : ‘ although my heart tells me @entity0 will be back , my head tells me he wo n’t , and i do n’t think we will see him tour again			0
none of the musicians @entity0 worked with have heard from him			0
he feels he ’s made his mark and he ’s content with that			0
’ others in the know agree			0
recently , his long - time tour promoter @entity140 admitted he , too , believes @entity0 will not make a return			2
instead , @entity0 — whose last album , @entity144 , came out nine years ago — seems to be content to see out his years in self - imposed obscurity			1
his exile , say those close to him , is to a large extent the result of his heart attack in @entity151 during his last tour in 2004			0
as he was rushed to hospital for emergency angioplasty , the tour was cancelled and another , planned for 2007 , scrapped			0
until his brush with death , @entity0 , a long - time heavy smoker , insisted on a full @entity160 fry - up every weekend			2
now his wife of 20 years , @entity29 , prepares him a fat - free sunday brunch of egg - white omelette with shiitake mushrooms and steamed asparagus			1
and she told followers on @entity167 earlier this year that she has replaced his favourite mashed potatoes with healthier — if less appetising — pureed cauliflower with non-fat sour cream			0
naturally , he wants to be around to see his daughter , known as @entity172 , grow up			0
indeed , @entity29 paints an idyllic picture of their life at home in @entity10 and at their sprawling country estate in the @entity179 in @entity180			0
while she cooks , @entity0 jams on keyboards and drums with @entity172 , helps his daughter with her homework and insists she reads for at least two hours every evening			0
of course , a therapist might put @entity0 ’s all - consuming approach to fatherhood down to the mess he made of parenting his only other child , his son @entity191 , from his volatile first marriage to @entity193			2
taxi for @entity0 ! the star hailed a cab to complete his journey dressed down : @entity0 kept his head down as he stepped out , wearing a casual outfit of a hooded sweatshirt , jeans , flat cap and sunglasses successful : @entity0 with his supermodel wife @entity29			1
she runs a make - up and lifestyle company that turns over more than £ 15million a year @entity193 was often consumed with jealous rages over his infidelities during their ‘ open marriage ’			2
they divorced in 1980 , with the singer winning custody of @entity191			0
single again , @entity0 gradually turned into a skeletal junkie existing on a milk and cocaine diet			2
increasingly paranoid because of his drug addiction , he began moving around the world — from @entity217 and @entity218 to @entity151 in a bid to escape his demons , often with his son in tow			0
in the early @entity223 , he decamped to a house in @entity225 in an ultimately successful attempt to get clean — and had the number one hit @entity228			0
but it was only when his hairdresser introduced him to the twice - divorced @entity29 that he was finally able to settle down			2
after their first date in @entity233 , @entity0 had her @entity235 hotel room filled with her favourite gardenias			0
they married in @entity225 in april 1992 , and later moved to @entity5 , from where @entity29 , now 57 , runs a successful make - up and lifestyle company that turns over more than £ 15million a year			1
recently , she said : ‘ i am not married to @entity0 — i am married to @entity0			0
they are two totally different people			0
’ @entity242 , author of a major @entity0 biography , told me : ‘ support from fans for a new tour would be huge , but maybe he feels he ’s said it all			0
he missed out on @entity191 ’s life and wants to spend as much time as possible with @entity172			0
’ @entity0 , it seems , is happy to spend his golden years far from the public gaze he once craved .			1
