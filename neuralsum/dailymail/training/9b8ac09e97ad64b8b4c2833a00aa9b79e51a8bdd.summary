by @entity0 published : 12:12 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 13:34 est , 11 march 2014 use of the gallows has n't taken place in @entity5 since 1976 , even though there are currently 405 convicts on death row @entity5 is searching for a new hangman after the latest recruit got upset on seeing the gallows for the first time and quit immediately			1
the @entity12 appointed the new hangman , the third most qualified from 176 applicants , last week , months after two hangmen chosen late last year failed to show up for work			1
@entity16 , commissioner general of prisons said : ' we gave him one week 's training , but he resigned after seeing the gallows			1
' he said that he did n't want the job			2
' he told me that after seeing the gallows he got upset			1
' next time , we will show the gallows to the new recruits before giving them basic training			1
' according to reports , he would n't have been likely to hang anyone anyway as the job is mostly light administrative work only			2
the @entity33 island nation is a predominantly @entity35 country , and has not carried out an execution since 1976			1
despite this , there are at least 405 convicts who have been sentenced to the death penalty			2
however , there has been an alarming rise in child abuse , rapes , murders , and drug trafficking in the country since the 25 year war against the @entity50 separatists			0
since the war ended in 2009 , lawyers and politicians have pushed for the death penalty to be reintroduced following the dramatic rise in violent crimes			0
the history of the death penalty in @entity5 starts with the @entity59 restricted the death penalty after they took control of the island in 1815			1
it was limited to murder , and ' waging war against the @entity66 '			0
but after independence , the then prime minister @entity67 abolished capital punishment in 1956			0
but it was very quickly reintroduced after his assassination in 1959			0
president @entity72 has made several attempts to reintroduce the death penalty			0
in march 1999 , after spurts of violence near the end of her first term in office , she stated that the government would be reintroducing the death penalty but was forced to back down because of public protest			0
but on november 19 , 2004 , a judge , @entity84 , was gunned down as he arrived home from work			0
this caused president @entity72 to reinstate capital punishment immediately			2
@entity5 is a nation mostly based around the @entity35 religion , which is one of peace			1
but despite this , there has been a rise in violent crime causing many politicians and lawyers to call for a renewed use of the death penalty while there are less countries that use the death penalty than there are that do n't , @entity5 is by no means the only country to have legal capital punishment			1
of the 195 independent states that are @entity108 members , 51 per cent have abolished the death penalty			0
meanwhile , 4 per cent retain it for crimes committed in exceptional circumstances , such as war			0
25 per cent permit its use for ordinary crimes , but have not used it for at least 10 years and are believed to have a policy or established practice of not carrying out executions ( such as @entity5 ) , and 20 per cent maintain the death penalty in both law and practice .			2
