celebrity chef @entity0 has posted a 2,100 word rant on social media claiming that the modern @entity4 diet is behind the rise in autism			1
@entity0 , who is a judge on reality cooking series @entity7 , took aim at the @entity10 and the @entity11 of @entity4 ( @entity12 ) on wednesday as he promoted the so - called benefits of the paleo diet			1
his fiery rant , which was motivated by a rude comment from a dietician on his @entity19 page , challenged the idea of the @entity10 's tick and also questioned some of the beliefs held by the @entity12 - both of which have spoken out against the paleo diet			1
' why has our rate of autism jumped from 1 in 10000 children in 1974 , to 1 in 50 in 2014 , where do you think it will be in another 40 years if it is escalating at this rate ? this has grown rapidly since the guidelines have been in place ! ' @entity0 wrote			2
world - recognised autism expert , professor @entity55 , has been researching the disorder for 30 years and quickly dismissed the claims made by @entity0			2
' there is absolutely no evidence that diet is the cause of autism , ' prof @entity58 told women 's weekly			0
' throwaway lines can be damaging because parents will try anything to help their children			0
' she said while some parents do see improvements in autistic children after changing their diet , it is thought to be related to predisposed stomach problems			0
' a number of children with autism do have gastrointestinal issues so diet may improve that and then , because they are no longer in pain , their behaviour may improve , ' prof @entity58 said			0
while @entity0 claimed current autism rates in children was one in 50 , autism organisations say the figure for 2014 is one in 100			2
the chef 's fiery rant was motivated by a rude comment from a dietician on his @entity19 page but his 2,100 post was n't just limited to autism			1
he also listed a number of other issues he believes the two nutrition organisations needed to address			0
' is n't it interesting that the people trusted to be delivering health advice for the public have come out not once , not twice , but so many times over the last year or so that i ca n't keep up with it , with a media campaign to bring down the paleo way of life by saying it is dangerous , ' he wrote			0
' why is @entity4 fast becoming the most obese and unhealthy nations on earth ? is this because we are a nation of self - obsessed , weak - minded people with no self - control ? no. is it because we are a nation that for far too long has been told to steer clear of foods naturally high in fat , which naturally trigger our fullness hormone , and instead told to eat 6 - 8 servings of processed carbohydrate a day , and wonder why we are still hungry after eating 3 cups of rice or 6 slices of bread ? ' he said the @entity128 had ' ignited a spark that has been inside me , which is now a raging fire in my belly '			0
the @entity10 said they would not be engaging with @entity0 ' @entity19 post but continued to urge @entity4 not to go on any fad diet that eliminates any particular food group			1
' the paleo diet , which seems to be very topical at the moment , in general appears to encourage people to avoid carbohydrates and dairy and eat large amounts of meat and saturated fats , ' a statement read .			1

@entity0 linked the rise in autism to the modern @entity4 diet in a fiery @entity19 post promoting his paleo diet
the diet bans all types of dairy and grains , but promotes meat , eggs , vegetables and natural oils
the @entity7 judge took aim at the @entity10 and the @entity11 of @entity4
both nutritional organisations have spoken out against the paleo diet
