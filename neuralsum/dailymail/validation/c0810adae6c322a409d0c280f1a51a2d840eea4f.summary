mps and peers may have to abandon the @entity2 within 20 years unless a multi-billion renovation is given the go ahead , the commons speaker @entity4 has warned			1
mr @entity4 said a ' not inconsequential sum of public money ' was needed to keep the @entity2 ' fit for purpose '			1
he said it would be a ' huge pity ' to have to leave the @entity11 , but experts have warned up to £ 3billion of repairs to the crumbling building are needed			1
@entity4 said a ' not inconsequential sum of public money ' was needed to keep the @entity2 ' fit for purpose ' among the problems are leaking roofs and pipes , ancient electrics and plumbing , asbestos , subsidence , badly - damaged stonework and fire risks			1
speaking in @entity2 mr @entity4 said : ' this is a fabulous institution located in awesome surroundings			1
it must not have the ethos of a museum			0
' it will require bold and imaginative managerial leadership to ensure that we are a @entity37 fit for purpose and that this @entity40 legacy can be rendered practical for contemporary representation			1
' referring to the blaze that burned down the old palace of @entity2 in 1834 , mr @entity4 said : ' it would be a huge pity if we decided that by the time we had reached the 200th anniversary of the vast fire which consumed the old parliament and brought this one in to being , we had to abandon this site and look elsewhere in order to serve the public interest properly			1
' he added : ' yet i will tell you in all candour that unless management of the very highest quality and a not inconsequential sum of public money are deployed on this estate over the next 10 years , that will be the outcome			2
' the cost of repairing the houses of @entity37 could top £ 3billion , an examination of options for renovating the historic building has suggested			1
mps and peers may have to abandon the houses of @entity37 within 20 years unless a multi-billion renovation is given the go ahead among the problems are leaking roofs and pipes , ancient electrics and plumbing , asbestos , subsidence , badly - damaged stonework and fire risks the cost of repairing the houses of @entity37 could top £ 3billion , an examination of options for renovating the historic building has suggested here is just some of the work that needs to be done to the @entity2 to prevent a ‘ looming crisis ’ : asbestos the walls and floors are infested with the dangerous substance - putting all occupants of the @entity2 at risk			1
@entity89 much of the building needs re-wiring , and generators do not produce enough power @entity94 many original shafts are filled with wires , and a major failure of the ventilation system is judged to be inevitable			2
heating many boilers date from the 1930s , pipes are clogged with limescale and are in danger of fracturing – causing dangerous steam leaks which could close the @entity11 chamber for months flooding faulty guttering and broken pipes cause regular flooding , and the @entity112 belfry is particularly badly affected by water penetration			1
walls are damp and stained			0
@entity116 @entity115 a problem throughout the @entity2 , particularly as cast - iron roofs are coming to the end of their life			2
@entity121 several pieces of wood fall from the fourteenth - century roof of @entity125 every year , while in 1980 a heavy boss fell from the roof of the @entity129 chamber drainage pipes and culverts seriously overloaded because they are now expected to deal with more waste than expected			1
dr @entity134 said last year that it was '' not unreasonable '' to think the bill could top £ 2 billion , but @entity139 's @entity138 programme claimed that the '' working assumption '' of insiders was that it could be a billion more			0
the speaker also addressed the ' agony ' of the controversial process to recruit a new clerk for the @entity146 , insisting he had always believed that splitting the role in two was the right way to proceed			0
mr @entity4 led an appointment panel in an external search to replace sir @entity151 , who retired early as clerk last summer after a 40 - year commons career			2
the proposed appointment of @entity156 official @entity155 was abandoned by mr @entity4 after protests from @entity158 that she was not able to do the job because she had no knowledge of commons procedure			1
a committee led by former cabinet minister @entity163 recommended splitting the role , with a director general responsible for administration and the clerk left to manage the constitutional and parliamentary elements			0
mr @entity4 said : ' on taking extensive evidence , they could see that the management of the @entity146 was simply not fit for purpose and they set out constructive proposals to equip us for the modern world			2
' i am absolutely ecstatic that they reached the conclusions that they did , that they managed to obtain unanimity for their recommendations and that their findings were then accepted by colleagues without dissent in the debate in december and the legislation that came before the @entity146 last week			0
' my one regret about all this is that it was not possible to find the consensus required to commission the @entity194 a year earlier , because if we had it would have saved us the utter agony of a doomed first attempt			0
' finding a human being who was a parliamentary expert of the highest repute and a chief executive of stellar managerial form proved predictably impossible			0
' now that the role has rightly been separated - i argued all along that the clerk should not also be the chief executive and this has now been agreed by the @entity146 - i am confident that we will be able to find a clerk of the @entity146 whose constitutional qualifications would make @entity210 proud and a director general who can take on , full - time , the management of the @entity11			2
' the speaker also set out his plans for greater public involvement in the work of the @entity11			1
he said : ' democracy needs not only to be done but to be seen to be done to enjoy the weight it deserves			0
reconnecting parliament and the public is thus not some sort of public relations exercise but absolutely central to its status			0
' mr @entity4 said he was ' intrigued ' by the recommendation of the @entity227 for online public ' e-discussions ' before debates in @entity125 , the @entity11 ' second chamber			1
the speaker also repeated his criticism of the way @entity235 's questions was conducted , and called for the party leaders to improve the tone of the exchanges			0
he said : ' pmqs are what the public see and hear of @entity37 more than anything else			2
' my submission , supported anecdotally wherever i go around the country and by some polling evidence , is that the public disapprove of the decibel level and orchestrated barracking			0
' put simply , if the party leaders want conduct on a wednesday lunchtime to improve , it will			0
post-election there will be an opportunity to achieve change that the public would welcome			0
