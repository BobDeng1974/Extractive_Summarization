by @entity0 last updated at 2:02 am on 28th september 2011 families are typically £ 728 a year worse off than 12 months ago , a study showed yesterday			1
the decline – more severe than during the 2008 recession – comes amid warnings that the cost of living squeeze is about to get worse			1
the monthly @entity8 claims ‘ families have never had it so tough ’ with a 7.9 per cent fall in average household discretionary spending			1
this means that after covering must - pay bills for food , heat , light , and the mortgage or rent , the average family is left with just £ 162 a week for everything else			2
the figures are a further blow to claims that the economy is in recovery and come at the same time as @entity26 supermarkets launch a vicious price war to capture customers ' diminishing spending @entity30 's @entity8 found that the average family now has £ 162 disposable income per week , a 7.9 per cent fall since last year for someone on average earnings , the £ 14 a week fall equates to a pay cut of around £ 1,000 a year			1
the figures are the worst in the four - year history of the study , while the current cost of living squeeze is said to be the longest and deepest for at least 60 years			2
two other studies confirm the situation has profound consequences for families and the wider economy			1
the @entity45 found one third of those with a company pension scheme have stopped making contributions because they can not afford them , so threatening poverty in old age			2
@entity54 cuts : @entity55 has slashed 3,000 prices to appeal to cash - strapped consumers and the @entity58 said high street sales are down on this time last year , which could push some retailers over the edge			2
the @entity30 study found nine in ten of us say things are tougher now than they were this time last year			2
customers say utilities and fuel costs are the biggest pressure on income			1
the official @entity72 measure of inflation rose from 4.4 per cent in july to 4.5 per cent in august			0
these increases are way ahead of an average 2 per cent rise in incomes and pensions in the past year , which means @entity26 are getting poorer by the week			1
@entity30 offered some relief to consumers by announcing a 2p a litre cut in the price of petrol and diesel			0
it was immediately followed by @entity55 and @entity84			0
@entity85 ’s said it was cutting fuel prices at many stores by ‘ up to ’ 2p per litre			0
@entity30 ’s fuel price cut means there will be a national price cap across all its 188 petrol stations of 130.7p a litre for unleaded and 135.7 for diesel			0
the income tracker is compiled in partnership with the @entity97 and @entity98 , whose managing economist , @entity99 , warned there may be worse to come			1
‘ rising unemployment has added further pressure to household finances in recent months , compounding the squeeze on spending power caused by high inflation and weak earnings growth , ’ he said			0
‘ family spending power has fallen sharply compared with a year ago			0
with the @entity26 economy in a particularly precarious state at the moment , things could get worse before they get better			1
’ @entity30 asked customers what the government should do to help people			0
four in five said action to put money into people ’s pockets should be top of the agenda			0
two in five wanted a freeze on energy bills and a quarter wanted a cut in fuel duty .			0

' it 's clear from this record drop in disposable income that @entity26 families have never had it so tough '
