outraged : @entity1 fashion designer and @entity4 survivor @entity3 's angry letter about her mistreatment at the hands of @entity8 investigators and tabloids is hitting the auction block a wealthy survivor of the titanic sinking complains in a letter being auctioned this month of ' disgraceful ' treatment in the press during a @entity8 inquiry into the disaster			1
the may 1912 letter by aristocratic fashion designer @entity19 is being offered by @entity20 of @entity21			1
@entity22 and her husband were among a dozen people who survived in a lifeboat built for 40			1
tabloids dubbed it the ' @entity28 ' because scuttlebutt had it that her husband bribed the crew to row away from the sinking ship faster			1
in a private letter to a friend , @entity3 writes , ' we did n't seem to have done the right thing in being saved at all ! is n't it disgraceful			1
' according to @entity20 , the letter was composed the couple 's @entity41 resident as a @entity8 wreck commissioner 's inquiry into the accident was taking place			1
the couple were the only two passengers called to testify at the inquiry			2
in spite of their grilling in the press , the @entity50 were cleared by the @entity8 wreck commissioner 's inquiry , which found only that more passengers may have been saved had the lifeboat turned around			1
' correspondence from prominent passengers with such exceptional @entity4 content is rarely encountered — especially written so soon after the tragedy , ' said @entity63 , executive vp at @entity20			0
while little - known outside of fashion historian circles , @entity3 ’s contributions to the fashion industry far exceed her limited notoriety			2
@entity3 was not simply just a purveyor of hyper feminine clothes			0
it was a game - changer in the realms of fashion business practices , as well as marketing			2
@entity3 ( who often went by @entity3 , professionally ) created the first - ever designer collaboration with a two - season run for @entity76 appalled : the letter from @entity22 reveals her anger over presumptions she and her wealthy husband paid off crew members to quickly row away from the sinking @entity4			1
she was rescued in a lifeboat that held 12 people despite being built for 40 ' we did n't seem to have done the right thing in being saved at all ! is n't it disgraceful , ' she tells a friend in the strongly worded may 1912 letter she was also one of the first designers to stage runway shows , release a branded perfume , and issue coupons in magazines as a way to draw customers into her handful of international boutiques			1
@entity3 was founded in 1893 according to @entity98 , author of the self - published book @entity100 , as a way to support herself in the aftermath of her first marriage			0
@entity3 built @entity3 ’s name on attention - grabbing antics			2
she was the first designer to utilize celebrity culture as a method for attracting public recognition			2
@entity3 ’s sister , the novelist and film producer @entity112 , offered the designer an inside track to famous entertainers and the more renowned members of the @entity116 , whom she dressed in a time when performers were still considered painted lady - type figures			2
successful : despite the shrill tone the lady strikes in her letter , @entity3 was a shrewd and cunning business woman who gained renown in the fashion world in her day @entity3 ’s many publicity stunts earned her label a certain sense of notoriety — one which was tempered by her lofty social title , which she earned in her second marriage to @entity134 landowner and @entity136 fencer sir @entity135			1
‘ how she presented herself went a long way in the business , the whole idea that she was aristocratic allowed her to be so suggestive , ’ said @entity137 , a fashion history professor at @entity138 , @entity139			2
@entity3 ’s influence hit its peak in the @entity146 era , a time when ruffled extravagance was de rigeuer among the world ’s wealthy			0
but when the @entity153 hit , a need for simplified elegance suddenly arose			0
tasked with maintaining her relevance , @entity3 decided to expand her potential reach to the everyday person			0
in 1916 , two years after the war began , @entity3 teamed up with then mail order - only business @entity76 on a small co-opted collection			0
the designs -- which included daywear , special occasion items , outerwear , and even suits -- were ‘ very close to her couture aesthetic , super feminine with lots of ribbons , lots of layers , lots of lace , and sumptuous material like velvets , chiffon , and silks , ’ said @entity177			0
with inflation , the garments ( priced from $ 25 to $ 40 ) , would cost between $ 500 and $ 900 , which @entity177 says is ‘ very comparable to the cost of high - end ready - to - wear today			0
’ the designs , which were still custom - tailored ( customers had to fill out forms with their full - body measurements ) , were remarkably less expensive than @entity3 ’s couture pieces that , with inflation , would run in the ballpark of $ 5,000			0
@entity3 continued to design into the @entity188 , but ‘ she did n’t groom a successor , at that time once a designer would pass away the whole business would close			0
those who had diversified later on , like @entity194 , made sure there was someone to take over the business , ’ @entity137 added			0
the house of @entity3 entirely dissolved by 1933 , and lay dormant until 2005 when her great - great granddaughter decided to reinvigorate the house for the modern era			0
@entity202 : despite their lifeboat being fit for 40 , the @entity50 ' only held 12 survivors after the wreck			1
that , paired with speculation that @entity3 's husband bribed crew members to speed away without letting the boat fill , won titanic lifeboat no. 1 the nickname @entity202 in the press			1

aristocratic fashion designer @entity19 wrote of the ' disgraceful ' treatment she and her husband received in 1912
she and husband @entity135 were *accused* in the press of bribing crew to row faster after 12 were saved in their boat , which was built for 40
tabloids of the day dubbed it the ' @entity28 ' though a @entity8 wreck commissioner 's inquiry would later clear the couple of *wrongdoing*
