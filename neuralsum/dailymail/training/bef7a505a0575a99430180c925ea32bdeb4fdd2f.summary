her chronic anxiety , an effect of an obsessive compulsion to control her food intake , caused her weight to shrink dangerously low , to the horror of her family and friends			1
recovered : @entity4 's weight plummeted to to 5st 7lb because she thought basic foods were poisoning her			1
she was later diagnosed with a rare form of obsessive compulsive disorder and now weighs a healthy 9st 7lb having undergone therapy miss @entity4 was working as a freelance fashion stylist when her @entity20 began to manifest itself			1
she said : ' i was incredibly stressed , doing a job that i hated			2
the recession had hit and the work was drying up			2
' i was working so hard to make something of my freelance career , which involved a lot of rejection			0
i felt as if i had no control			2
' i began dictating to myself what i could and could n’t eat			0
as my behaviour developed , it became an ocd , where i thought practically everything was poison			0
' it was all rooted in my desire for control			1
' decline : @entity4 pictured while she was rapidly losing weight			1
her chronic anxiety , an effect of an obsessive compulsion to control her food intake , meant she only ate @entity43 , salt and vinegar crisps and pizza while @entity20 is treated as an entirely separate condition to eating disorders such anorexia and bulimia , it is known that patients with @entity20 tend to experience eating disorders more severely			1
miss @entity4 , of @entity54 , suspects her paranoia that food was harming her was made worse by the fact that she also suffers from @entity58 , which causes chronic fatigue			1
shrinking : @entity4 says her eating habits were rooted in her desire for control miss @entity4 said : ' i did n’t want to be thin			1
i was n’t avoiding eating to stay skinny			2
' instead , i was convinced that unless i restricted myself to the foods i had decided were ok , i would poison myself			0
' i drew up an " allowed " list and a " forbidden " list			0
before long , the " allowed " list had just three things - @entity68 , salt and vinegar crisps , and thin - crust pizza			0
' eventually , all i could manage was @entity43			2
my mum became really concerned			0
she would try to tempt me with new foods like macaroni cheese , but all i could do was sob into the plate , pleading with her and warning her that it would kill me			0
' at her lowest ebb in the spring of 2012 , miss @entity4 , who is 5ft 8in , weighed just 5st 7lb			1
the physical and emotional exertion was so great that she contemplated suicide			0
she said : ' i thought i was being an enormous burden on my parents , and i did n’t know whether i would ever get better			0
i could n’t see any way out			0
' an appointment with her gp finally put her anxieties in context and , after an intensive course of cognitive behavioural therapy , she finally began to put on weight			2
she said : ' i stood on the scales and the doctor said , " if you lose another half a stone , your organs are going to fail "			1
it was a wake - up call			0
' when the doctor diagnosed me with @entity20 i was surprised because i thought i would be described as having a simple eating disorder			1
' it never occurred to me that my behaviour - my systematic approval and disapproval of foods - was compulsive			0
' but once i heard that i had @entity20 , it all started to make sense			1
' he said it was rare for @entity20 to have the effect it had on me , but not unknown			1
