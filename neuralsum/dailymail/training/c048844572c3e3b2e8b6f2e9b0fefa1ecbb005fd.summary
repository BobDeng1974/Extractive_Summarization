the move from the socialist president , who is resisting budget cuts , came as it emerged profligate @entity3 bureaucrats have awarded themselves pay rises worth an average of £ 3,000 a year			1
in what was quickly dubbed ‘ @entity24 ’ by diplomats , mr @entity9 caused astonishment at an @entity3 summit by failing to turn up for talks with mr @entity1 , @entity29 leader @entity28 and @entity5 president @entity30			1
mr @entity9 claimed meetings with the leaders of other spendthrift nations – including @entity34 and @entity35 – had ‘ overrun ’ and did not appear for any of a scheduled hour - long discussion in @entity6			1
mr @entity9 was said to be furious that mr @entity30 was on the point of agreeing to demands from mr @entity1 and mrs @entity28 for a significant cut in @entity3 spending			1
the prime minister has repeatedly threatened to veto a seven - year deal unless @entity6 agrees to tighten its belt			1
rumours swept the summit that mr @entity30 was ready to agree to a budget ceiling of around £ 819billion – a cut of more than £ 60billion from his initial proposal of £ 881billion			0
if approved , it would be the first time in the history of the @entity3 that leaders have agreed to cut the budget			0
the @entity3 ’s last seven - year budget , which runs from 2007 to 2013 , had a ceiling of £ 847billion			0
arriving for talks , the prime minister said : ‘ frankly , the @entity58 should not be immune from the sorts of pressures we ’ve had to reduce spending , find efficiencies and make sure that we spend money wisely			2
’ rift : mr @entity9 ( right ) failed to turn up for talks at the @entity3 summit with mr @entity1 , @entity29 leader @entity28 and @entity5 president @entity30 demanding cuts : mr @entity9 was said to be furious that @entity5 president mr @entity30 was on the point of agreeing to demands from mr @entity1 and @entity28 for a significant cut in @entity3 spending he said the numbers on the previous proposal had been ‘ far too high ’ , warning : ‘ if they do n’t come down , there wo n’t be a deal			1
’ crucially , he has secured the support of @entity81 ’s most powerful leader , mrs @entity28 , as well as the @entity82 , the @entity83 and the @entity84			2
but although mr @entity1 has targeted the pay and perks of the 50,000 @entity3 officials , it also emerged that a longstanding levy on their salaries has been allowed to lapse			2
it means they will now receive automatic windfalls worth an average of £ 3,000 a year – an increase of 4.47 per cent , and pushing the average pay past £ 70,000 for the first time			0
@entity99 , senior political analyst at the @entity101 think - tank , said : ‘ the @entity3 budget negotiations have shown how difficult it is for member states to ask their taxpayers to continue to fund an unreformed @entity3 civil service			0
the prime minister , pictured with @entity84 's prime minister @entity108 said : ' frankly , the @entity58 should not be immune from the sorts of pressures we 've had to reduce spending , find efficiencies and make sure that we spend money wisely ' if member states are serious in reforming the @entity3 budget , @entity3 civil servants ’ pay , allowances and tax privileges all need to be looked at			0
’ @entity121 mp @entity120 , one of the prime minister ’s harshest critics , who led a @entity125 revolt over @entity3 spending , said : ‘ if the @entity123 comes back to the @entity11 with a real terms cut in the @entity3 it will be a historic political achievement			0
’ however , the talks could be scuppered due to the demands of @entity10 , which is targeting @entity11 ’s budget rebate , and @entity34 , which wants a higher overall @entity3 budget to which it makes lower contributions			1
mr @entity9 wants to slash the annual rebate for @entity11 won by @entity138 in 1984			2
@entity139 gave away a chunk of the rebate in 2005 , in exchange for a promise of reform of agricultural subsidies that never materialised , but mr @entity1 has vowed to defend what remains to the hilt .			0
