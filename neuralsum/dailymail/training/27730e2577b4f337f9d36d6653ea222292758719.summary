@entity29 and other fast - growing internet specialists , such as @entity31 and @entity32 , use the same ploy			2

the change , which comes into effect in april next year , could add £ 2 to the price of a blockbuster dvd , such as the @entity42 , taking it up to £ 12			1
a chart cd , such as @entity44 ’s 21 , could go up by £ 1.60 to around £ 9.60			1

‘ we are also protecting a significant amount of tax revenue			0
by making these changes , we are striking the best possible balance between the costs of collecting small amounts of vat and protecting the interests of @entity16 taxpayers and businesses			0
