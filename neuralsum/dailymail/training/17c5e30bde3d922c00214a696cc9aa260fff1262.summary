by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor deputy prime minister @entity2 said it was wrong to think @entity5 troops could be sent to ' sort ' the problems in @entity8 @entity5 will not repeat the ‘ mistake ’ of the @entity14 by sending troops to deal with the uprising by @entity12 - inspired militants , @entity2 warned today			1
the deputy prime minister rejected the idea of the @entity5 becoming involved in tackling the @entity17 group which has already seized @entity8 's second biggest city @entity20 and @entity21 's hometown of @entity22			1
today the group boasted it had full control of @entity24 while its leaders boasted it step up their drive towards the capital @entity28			1
more than a decade after @entity33 ’s decision to join @entity35 ’s invasion , leaders on both sides of the @entity31 are reluctant to become embroiled in a new conflict in @entity8			1
@entity8 prime minister @entity37 has appealed for help from the international community			1
but mr @entity2 insisted this would not involve @entity5 troops returning to @entity8 soil			1
speaking on his @entity44 phone - in , mr @entity2 said : ‘ we provide help to the @entity8 government			1
we provide training and equipment and so on			0
‘ i have no idea what the @entity8 government will be asking of others in terms of the material support they need or the training they need			2
‘ if in one way or another the invasion of @entity8 in the first place has contributed to the instability in @entity8 more widely , should we be going back in to try and sort it ? ‘ i do n’t think having made one mistake you repeat it by making another one			2
‘ that does n’t mean that i have a perfectly packaged solution for this			1
’ the ruthless rebel @entity12 splinter group this week took control of second city @entity20 and @entity21 ’s home city of @entity22 as part of an effort to set up a @entity74 militant enclave across the @entity8 / @entity76 border			1
foreign secretary @entity77 yesterday dismissed suggestions that the @entity5 had a duty to intervene because of its previous role in the @entity8 war			2
' you ca n't say the crisis was created by invading it and then we should invade it again , ' he said			0
' i do n't think that 's part of the solution			2
it is a democratic country with democratically elected leaders and that is something it never had before			0
' it also faces the challenges of extremism and that is something we have to support them in dealing with but ask them and expect them to take leadership in their own country			0
' militants have taken 48 hostages from the @entity109 consulate in @entity20 and @entity110 secretary general @entity111 urged the international community to ' unite in showing solidarity with @entity8 as it confronts this serious security challenge			1
' ' terrorism must not be allowed to succeed in undoing the path towards democracy in @entity8 , ' he said			2
@entity8 displaced families queue at a checkpoint in @entity122 , @entity123 after fighters from the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) captured key cities from government troops foreign secretary @entity77 has ruled out sending in @entity5 forces , in a repeat of @entity33 's 2003 invasion however , @entity8 - born @entity129 claimed the ' divisive sectarian ' rule of mr @entity37 had fanned the flames			1
mr @entity129 told @entity132 ’s today that the @entity133 might consider providing air support to @entity8 troops in efforts to retake territory			1
' this really goes back to the @entity133 policy in @entity8 when @entity140 was administering the country			2
he took a decision , backed by the @entity133 government , to disband the @entity144 - the ‘ de-ba’athification ’ process , ' he said			0
' he sent home 700,000 men with weapons , no jobs , no job prospects , predominantly @entity74 , to their families			0
' some of those people organised and this chap @entity153 , who is the emir of @entity17 , is one of those men			0
' it is compounded by @entity37 ’s divisive , sectarian policies			0
@entity37 is the commander in chief and the minister of defence - because he has n’t appointed anyone - so he decides who gets promoted within the army			0
' @entity161 mp @entity129 blamed the ' divisive sectarian ' rule of @entity8 @entity163 for fanning the flames of tensions in his country the premier had also withheld funds from @entity169 amid ongoing efforts to create a ' true coalition ' government bringing together all sides after inconclusive elections which gave no party a clear majority			1
' the @entity133 have sold @entity37 some fighter jets			0
i do n’t know whether they would go further and heed his call for further intervention with some air cover for the @entity8 military to be able to retake some of these cities , ' mr @entity129 said			0
the mp - who was among those who supported strikes on the @entity76 regime of @entity188 last summer which were effectively voted down by the @entity190 - said failure to act there had opened the door to groups such as @entity17			0
' i argued for very limited intervention to take the chemical weapons out of the game in @entity76 to protect the silent majority of innocent people , ' he said			0
' early intervention in @entity76 , supporting people who were working towards replacing @entity188 with a moderate democracy which is inclusive would have been the right move because otherwise the message you send to the silent majority is actually you do n’t care about them and that is where these groups thrive because they go in and they are brutal and they take over and fill that vacuum			0
