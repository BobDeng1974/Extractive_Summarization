@entity0 was such a disappointment to @entity2 less than three years ago that manager @entity3 was ready to dump him — and told a rival team he was going to be available			1
the @entity5 can reveal that on the eve of the @entity8 in august 2011 , @entity3 told a senior official from @entity10 that @entity0 was among riders whose contracts were expiring and who were not in @entity2 ’s plans for 2012			1
turnaround : in 2013 @entity0 won the @entity16 for @entity2 but two years earlier they did n't want him in the shadow : before 2012 @entity0 ( left ) was firmly in the shadow of @entity19 ( centre ) sources say both teams were staying at the same hotel in @entity24 , and the pair were discussing their rider requirements			1
@entity10 were interested in @entity2 ’s @entity27 but @entity3 said he was already planning to go elsewhere			2
‘ @entity3 then suggested that @entity10 might be interested in @entity31 , ’ said a source with knowledge of the meeting			0
‘ he made it clear things were n’t working out as envisaged and that @entity0 might be able to do a job elsewhere			0
’ @entity10 did not see @entity0 as the kind of rider they needed			0
touted : @entity0 was offered to @entity10 but they too were not keen on the @entity38 rider abandoned : @entity0 was almost dropped by @entity2 until a strong perfomance in 2010 changed their minds as it transpired , @entity0 rode the race of his life over the next few weeks , finishing second in a breakthrough event that changed the course of his entire career			1
@entity2 retained him and bumped up his £ 80,000 - a - year wages			0
he went on to became an integral part of @entity19 ’s @entity16 win in 2012 before winning it himself in 2013			2
@entity0 has credited his rise in part to diagnosis and treatment of bilharzia , a tropical disease he had been unwittingly carrying until late 2010 , when he embarked on a three - year battle to get rid of it .			0

in 2010 @entity2 offered @entity38 rider to @entity10
@entity10 were not interested so @entity0 remained
rider earned a new contract *supporting* @entity19
@entity0 went on to win 2013 @entity16
