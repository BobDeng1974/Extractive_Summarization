by @entity0 published : 18:31 est , 3 august 2012 updated : 12:14 est , 4 august 2012 a teenage lacrosse player was caught by his coach sneaking on board a plane early was forced to read a lengthy apology to the plane ’s passengers			1
@entity8 appeared hesitant before delivering the apology , but was coached by a @entity11 flight attendant to stand front and centre and face those that he ’d wronged			1
the entire blustering , uncomfortable apology of the @entity18 teenager is caught on camera			0
the flight attendant held up the @entity29 while he read			2
‘ my fellow travellers , ’ he began , ’ today i address you with great remorse			0
during the boarding process , i took advantage of this airline ’s kindness			0
’ he said that while some of his teammates were called to the front of the queue , @entity8 was not among them , but went ahead anyways			1
‘ this is not the way my coaches , teammates , or parents expect me to behave , and for all of this , i apologise			0
’ the story was first reported by @entity61 , which also provided video of @entity8 's apology			2
throughout the teen ’s speech , those in the cabin booed when he confessed to his actions , and cheered when he apologises			0
contrite : he concluded with : ' i am just a young man that thinks i ¿ m smarter than i am ' fin : he bashfully walked back to his seat after completing the apology ‘ i hope you will all find it in your hearts to forgive me , for i am just a young man that ( sic ) thinks i ’m smarter than i am			0
' enjoy your flight , ' he concluded , ' and remember to fly @entity11 , because they let my coach do this to me			1
’ many of the passengers seemed to be in good humour over it and applauded him as he made his way down the aisle to his seat			2
and one thing is for certain – one red - faced lacrosse player will not be jumping the queue anytime soon .			1

high school lacrosse player @entity8 jumped the queue to board plane more *quickly* , though it was *n't* his turn
his coach made him read lengthy letter of apology to passengers on @entity11 flight
