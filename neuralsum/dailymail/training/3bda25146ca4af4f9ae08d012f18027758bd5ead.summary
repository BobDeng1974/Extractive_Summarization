by @entity0 and @entity1 weather officials in @entity3 say a mysterious presence that showed up on its radar the last few nights has turned out to be of the insect variety			1
a mysterious green formation showed up on the @entity10 's radar that looked to be rain			1
it was no storm , but a swarm of grasshoppers over @entity3 's @entity15 for the fourth night in a row on friday			2
insect swarm : the grasshoppers showed up as a green cloud on radars , prompting technicians to check they were still functioning in the absence of any rain meteorologist @entity24 says the swarm got caught up in winds heading southwest and is being carried as high as 1,000 feet , well above the height of the city 's tallest buildings			1
@entity24 says the grasshoppers likely hatched weeks ago and are now grown , leading to their ability to trigger radar images			0
officials say last year 's monsoon season and a drier winter created the ideal environment for the grasshoppers to hatch			2
there was n't enough rain to kill the eggs so they all hatched , creating the worst infestation in 20 years			1
infestation : a garage door is covered in the insects , which hatched in record numbers because of a dry winter biblical proportions : @entity3 residents will have to put up with the bugs until they move on technicians initially thought their equipment was malfunctioning when they saw several unexplained clusters			1
' we really thought that our radar was broke , ' @entity52 , a forecaster from the @entity10 told @entity55			0
' so we sent our technicians out there a couple of times and we could n't find anything wrong so we had to call the @entity61 in @entity62			0
' some citizens want the state to spray insecticides for the insects , but @entity67 , extension agent at @entity68 says it will be ineffective			0
' it is a nuisance to people because they fly into people ’s faces while walking , running , and biking			0
they are hopping into people ’s homes and garages , they splatter the windshield and car grill while driving , and they will eat people ’s plants , ' @entity67 told @entity55 , but that ' this , too , shall pass			0

weather officials were *baffled* by a green cloud that showed up on radars in @entity3
the cloud looked like rain ***-*** but there was none , prompting technicians being dispatched to check the radars
it was actually a huge swarm of grasshoppers
*due* to a dry winter , many more grasshoppers have hatched than usual ***-*** the most in 20 years
there is n't anything the state can do about it ***-*** residents must wait until they move on
