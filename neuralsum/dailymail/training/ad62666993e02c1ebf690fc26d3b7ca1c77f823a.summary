a blind man who had to leave his job when he could no longer see his computer has been told he is fit for work again - in a letter written in small print			1
@entity7 , 62 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , took early retirement from his job as a local government clerk in a social services department because increased use of computers in his office meant he could no longer do his work			1
after 28 years ' service in local government mr @entity7 , who has been registered blind after being diagnosed with congenital glaucoma before he was two , had to leave work and rely on benefits			1
' @entity23 trick ' : mr @entity7 , whose wife is also blind , had to wait until his carer could read the letter out to him but earlier this month he passed a test set as part of the government ’s new welfare reforms to assess those who should or should not still remain off work and claim state handouts , and was told he should go back to work			1
the tests found he could lift one of his arms above his head , pick things up , stay in the same place for an hour , could control his bladder and ' stay conscious ' whilst awake			0
as a result mr @entity7 , who reads using braille and uses a white cane to get around , was sent a letter saying he no longer qualifies for his monthly £ 350 @entity47 because he ' does not have limited capability for work			1
' he said : ' it ’s a rotten trick			2
what was just as upsetting was i had to wait for a support worker to come and read the letter out to me - it seemed like the final insult			2
' admittedly two days after i got it read to me i had the braille version , but it ’s not the point			2
the letter to mr @entity7 , whose wife @entity60 , 64 , is also blind , said : ' i understand that this decision may come as a shock to you , however i should explain that entitlement to employment and support allowance is not based on someone ’s health or disability itself			1
taken early retirement : mr @entity7 , from @entity8 , uses braille to read and a white stick to get around ' it is based on what a person is capable of doing rather than assuming their health condition or disability automatically prevents them from being able to work			1
' mr @entity7 , who has not worked since he took early retirement from @entity81 12 years ago , said : ' i ’ve been unemployed for this long so it ’s going to be very difficult to go back to work now			1
nobody wants to employ disabled people , and certainly not visually impaired people at that			0
' ' i understand the government wanting to get the bone idle back to work , but i worked hard in local government for the best part of 30 years despite my disability , and i did n’t even choose to leave my job in the first place			1
' technology moved on so quickly and i felt the workplace did n’t cater for the likes of me , so there was nothing i could do but take early retirement			2
' i do n’t know what i ’ll do now			0
i have support workers who come twice a week and help me with paperwork and read things out that are n’t in braille and help with the cleaning and shopping - and i wo n’t be able to afford that without this money			2
' mr @entity7 , with his wife @entity60 , 64 , at home in @entity8 , says : ' what if they tell me to become a bricklayer ? ' the @entity116 lists a series of tasks which the recipient must say whether or not they can do them			1
a statement from a healthcare professional said : ' the healthcare professional discussed these descriptors with mr @entity7 at the assessment and it was confirmed that he does not have any problems with these activities and therefore these descriptors are not appropriate			1
' it went on : ' you can move unaided more than 200 metres on solid ground , including using a wheelchair			0
you can stay in one place standing for one hour without having to move away			0
you can raise at least one arm above head height			0
' what happens if i walk down to the @entity138 and they give me a job as a bricklayer ? ' - @entity7 , 62 , who was registered blind 60 years ago and now has been told to go back to work ' you can pick up and move objects such as an empty cardboard box or carton of liquid			1
you can use a computer keyboard or mouse and a pen or a pencil with at least one hand			0
' mr @entity7 said : ' you must score 15 points to be deemed unsuitable for work and i scored nine			1
what am i going to do at my age ? ' what happens if i walk down to the @entity138 and they give me a job as a bricklayer ? ' i ’m going to appeal but if that ’s unsuccessful , which it may very well be , my lifestyle is going to be drastically changed			0
' mrs @entity165 , a former bank telephonist , said : ' i think it ’s a disgrace			0
he ’s a 62 - year - old blind man , for god ’s sake			2
how can he just go back to work now ? ' there ’s young people out there who ca n’t get work , never mind people his age and with his condition			2
a @entity180 spokesman said : ' it is important that we do n’t simply write people off			0
there is strong evidence that working can be beneficial for many people who have a health condition			0
' but we also want to ensure that those who need it get the right support , which is why a decision on whether someone is well enough to work is taken after consideration of all the supporting medical evidence provided by the claimant			0
' anyone can appeal against a decision			0
before the appeal is heard we review all decisions , taking into account further information provided			0
