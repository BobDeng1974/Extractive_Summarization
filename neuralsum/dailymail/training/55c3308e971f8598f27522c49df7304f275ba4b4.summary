another 7,500 are severely harmed after being wrongly diagnosed , given incorrect drugs or poorly cared for			2
experts warn that such mistakes will increase because already overstretched staff will be unable to cope with the higher numbers of patients coming into hospitals			1
health secretary @entity2 has admitted that there may still be ‘ pockets ’ of poor care like that revealed in @entity21 in 2008 , where hundreds of patients died needlessly			1
figures obtained by @entity26 in a @entity28 documentary to be aired tonight show that in 2011/12 , a total of 2,864 patients died following mistakes by hospital staff			1
this is up almost 5 per cent compared to the previous year when there were 2,726 deaths			2
errors include elderly patients being misdiagnosed with cancer when they had heart failure , and being given pointless treatment while they deteriorated			1
in other cases nurses or midwives failed to notice chest infections in newborn babies which could have been cured with antibiotics			2
dr @entity47 , of the @entity48 , who has carried out studies on hospital safety said : ‘ doctors , nurses , and managers do not realise the level of harm that ’s going on hospitals			2
‘ most hospitals are now having more and more patients coming through the front door			1
the money is at standstill , if not reducing			0
‘ the number of staff are therefore at the same level , they ’re having to do more work – and work harder and faster			1
‘ the research is very clear that where staff have to work extremely hard they are much more likely to make mistakes			1
’ death rates at 12 @entity71 hospital trusts are alarmingly high , says an annual guide from health information firm @entity73			1
those with above average death rates include @entity76 , @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 and @entity88			0

this is slightly higher than the preceding 12 months when there were 7,497 such cases			2
@entity95 , of the charity @entity96 , warned that the current system for monitoring patient safety ‘ is n’t fully fit for purpose ’			0
he said on the @entity26 programme that poor care – similar to that which led to the scandal at @entity21 hospital in 2008 – existed across the @entity106			1
up to 1,200 patients are thought to have died at the hospital from mistakes and neglect between 2005 and 2008			1
mr @entity95 , whose organisation receives 3,500 calls a year , said : ‘ we see elements of what happened at @entity21 in hospitals all around the country			1
‘ again we see regulators and commissioners , all thinking or wanting to believe that patient safety was somebody else ’s responsibility			0
and it ’s a terrible indictment of how the current system still is n’t fully fit for purpose			0
’ overstretched : poor care was revealed in @entity21 in 2008 where hundreds of patients died needlessly shocking : in 2011/12 a total of 2,864 patients died following mistakes by hospital staff ( file picture ) in a statement issued to the programme , the health secretary said : ‘ whilst failings in care at @entity137 have shocked many , we can not say with confidence that some of those failings do not exist in pockets elsewhere in the @entity71			1
’ he added : ‘ whilst the majority of patients receive excellent care from the @entity71 , we still have much to do to ensure quality of care is considered as important as quality of treatment throughout the system			1
’ @entity26 – how @entity152 ? will be screened tonight on @entity153 at 8.30pm			0
chest infection : tragic @entity155 with his sister @entity156 @entity155 died in hospital from an infection which could have been cured by antibiotics			0
his parents were repeatedly dismissed by midwives and nurses who insisted he ‘ looked fine ’			0

it later emerged that @entity155 had picked up a chest infection from his mother @entity170 who had been put on antibiotics immediately after the birth			0
@entity155 died in november 2008 , nine days after he was born at @entity173 , @entity174 in @entity173 , in @entity86			2
an inquest later heard how if he had been given antibiotics there was a 90 per cent chance he would have survived			0

he also said they had conspired to try to cover - up their mistakes			2
