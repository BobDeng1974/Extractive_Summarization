the higher the heels were , the more a woman 's gait , including the movement of her knees , changed , @entity6 research found wearing stilettos may not only be painful at the time			1
it could also raise the odds of arthritis in years to come			0
a study found that walking in three - inch heels causes changes to gait similar to those seen in ageing and arthritic knees			1
the finding could help explain why osteoarthritis is twice as common in women as men			1
the @entity22 researchers said : ‘ because women and men are observed to have similar knee biomechanics during barefoot walking , gender differences in footwear , specifically high - heeled shoes , have been implicated as a possible factor for the higher incidence of osteoarthritis in women			1
’ the most common form of arthritis , osteoarthritis , caused by wear and tear of cartilage that helps our joints take the strain of bending , lifting , gripping and kneeling , affects more than eight million @entity42			2
stiff , swollen and painful joints can make walking difficult , with stairs particularly tricky			0
the @entity6 researchers studied the gait of 14 women as they walked in different types of shoes , from flat trainers to heels that left the women teetering just over three inches off the ground			1
the higher the heels were , the more their gait , including the movement of their knees , changed			1
writing in the @entity59 , the scientists said being overweight may make things even worse			0
they added : ‘ many of the changes observed with increasing heel height and weight were similar to those seen with ageing and osteoarthritis progression			0
‘ this suggests that high heel use , especially in combination with additional weight , may contribute to increased osteoarthritis risk in women			2
’ other recent research has shown that when a woman slips on a pair of heels , it takes , on average , just over an hour for her feet to start to hurt			1
the survey , for the @entity81 , found that women are three times as likely as men to cram their feet into uncomfortable shoes – and that as a result , nine out of ten have suffered problems from bunions and corns to sprains and strains			2
experts warn that the prolonged wearing of high heels can also trigger stress fractures and trapped nerves			0
on the plus side , studies show that men are more likely to help a woman wearing heels than one in flats			2

but it takes women one year and seven months to show their partner their true selves , a study shows			1
most of the 1,000 women polled said that the longer they remain in a relationship , the less obsessed they are with appearing flawless at all times			0
but some 40 per cent admitted they deliberately hide the details of their beauty regime from their partners , and a third said they always want to keep up the pretence that they are naturally glamorous			0
one in 20 even admitted they have never allowed their man see them without a full face of make - up on			0
the research by make - up and beauty company @entity134 revealed that men are oblivious to the lengths their loves go to			0
a quarter of the 1,000 men polled said they have no idea what their partner ’s beauty regime entails .			0
