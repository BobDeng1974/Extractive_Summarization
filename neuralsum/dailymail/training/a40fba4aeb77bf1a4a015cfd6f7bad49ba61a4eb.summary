a blood test will soon allow doctors to tailor breast cancer treatment individually in a breakthrough which they hope will save thousands of lives			1
until now , medics have relied on scans to tell them whether a tumour is responding to therapy			2
but a test developed at @entity11 could give them the earliest warning yet that a chosen approach is ineffective , allowing them to try an alternative			1
it could be available for widespread use in less than three years , and the makers hope it will not only save or extend patients ’ lives , but minimise the unpleasant side - effects associated with many treatments , such as chemotherapy			1
breakthrough : a blood test developed by scientists at @entity11 could provide an early warning that certain breast cancer treatments are ineffective in the study , backed by @entity30 and published in the @entity31 , researchers took regular blood samples from 30 women with advanced breast cancer			1
they looked at three markers in the blood to see if they reflected advancement or regression in the disease			2
one of the indicators , ‘ circulating tumour @entity43 ’ , was detected in 29 of the 30 participants where changes in their cancer had been identified			2
although the tests were carried out on women with metastatic breast cancer – an aggressive form of the disease which has spread to other organs – scientists suggest it should work on all breast cancer sufferers , allowing for tailored treatments			0
in 2010 , 49 , 564 women and 397 men were diagnosed with breast cancer			0
a total of 11.633 died in 2010 , 49,564 women and 397 men were diagnosed with breast cancer , with 11,633 deaths			0
dr @entity62 , who is based at @entity30 ’s @entity63 , said : ‘ the main objective of the blood test is to see if someone is responding to their treatment and if not then switch them to an alternative therapy			1
‘ hopefully this tailored approach will translate into better survival rates or in the case of those with metastatic cancer , extend their lives for as long as possible			1
‘ the next step is to integrate this technology into a clinical trial			0
‘ we anticipate it should be routinely used within the next two to three years			1
’ currently , doctors monitor the progress of treatment by using scans to observe how the cancer is responding			1
the blood tests give an earlier and more detailed ‘ real time ’ picture of changes taking place in the body			0
lead author professor @entity93 added : ‘ this study highlights the potential of personalised cancer medicine			0
‘ fragments of @entity43 are shed by cancer cells when they die , meaning they can be detected in blood samples using sensitive new sequencing techniques			0
the levels of tumour @entity43 tell us how the cancer is responding to treatment			1
’ professor @entity106 , @entity30 ’s chief clinician , said : ‘ these results hold the promise of a system that could allow us to modify someone ’s treatment as their cancer changes , and they suggest an exciting way to quickly get hold of the personal details of a cancer , to target it for the most effective therapy			1
’ a breakthrough drug for women with an aggressive form of breast cancer could prevent their condition worsening for an extra six months			0
up to 10,000 women a year could benefit from the drug pertuzumab which today gets a licence for use in @entity129 from the @entity130			0
it works against the @entity133 - positive form of the disease and doctors say it could transform treatment in the same way as the ‘ wonder ’ drug @entity140			2
trials show women on combination treatment of pertuzumab , herceptin and chemotherapy lived on average for 18 months without their disease worsening , compared with 12 months for those not taking the new drug , also known as @entity151			2
dr @entity152 of the @entity153 in @entity154 said : ‘ i ’ve seen the disease getting worse in front of me and then women recovering when they have pertuzumab			0

test developed at @entity11 could save thousands of lives
it could also minimise unpleasant side effects from treatment
@entity164 could hit *hospitals* in under three years
