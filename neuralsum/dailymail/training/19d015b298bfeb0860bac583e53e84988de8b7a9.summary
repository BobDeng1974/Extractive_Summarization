by @entity0 a father attacked his baby son in hospital while the little boy was being treated for injuries he had inflicted in a previous violent outburst , it has been revealed			1
the child was taken to @entity9 in @entity10 when he was less than three weeks old where medical staff found he had suffered severe head injuries and ‘ forceful shaking ’			1
while he was still being treated for his injuries his father attacked him again - leaving him with extensive bruising			1
the shocking details of the father ’s violence against the child emerged as a family judge banned him from seeing his son - saying the baby would be in ‘ real danger ’ if any further contact took place			1
judge @entity34 , sitting at @entity33 , said the injuries suffered by the boy could only have been caused by the father and it was ‘ not possible ’ they were accidental			1
after the initial outburst , the child had been unresponsive for about an hour , but the father did not take him to hospital - saying he did n’t know where it was - and waited for the baby ’s mother to return home			2
the baby was initially treated for an infection , but scans revealed bleeding on the brain and social workers became involved after doctors suspected the infant had been assaulted			2
while he was still in hospital recovering from those injuries , the baby suffered further harm			0
the father called in a duty nurse as he was changing his son ’s nappy and claimed he had ‘ tripped ’ on the wheel of a cot and dropped the baby face down on the bed			1
after demonstrating to the nurse how he had fallen , the father said : ' i can not believe this has happened '			0
the judge said doctors were ‘ deeply suspicious ’ of both sets of injuries and , following extensive tests which ruled out natural causes , @entity68 launched care proceedings			2
the council did not take any issue with the mother ’s care and accepted she is a ‘ concerned and loving parent ’ who is capable of caring for the baby			0
during the family court hearing , the father ’s version of events was ruled out by doctors , who said it was simply ‘ not possible ’			0
medical staff also concluded that both sets of injuries could not have been caused by anything other than deliberately inflicted trauma			0
judge @entity94 said the father ’s evidence was ‘ neither credible nor reliable ’ , adding that his failure to alert the mother sooner when the baby first fell ill was an attempt to cover up the harm the child had suffered at his hands			2
civil case : judge @entity34 banned the father from seeing the child at @entity33 , saying the child would be in ' real danger ' if they were to remain in contact she said : ' there can be no other explanation as only the father was present and therefore only he knows what happened			1
' he left it to the mother and grandfather to raise their own concerns and to seek help for the baby , unaided by him			0
' the only explanation is that these were inflicted injuries , as all the medical evidence now supports			0
' she found that both sets of injuries could only have been caused by the father and ordered that he should have no contact with the baby			0
the judge said : ' those findings having been made , it makes any contact - supervised or otherwise - in the immediate future a very real risk and danger for the child			1
' i have to bear in mind that , on the second occasion , this baby was in a place of safety yet came to be injured by severe bruising over his head and body , the explanation given by the father simply not being a possibility			2
' as such , for the time being , there can be no safe contact between this child and the father			0
