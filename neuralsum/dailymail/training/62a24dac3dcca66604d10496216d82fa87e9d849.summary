by @entity0 published : 05:51 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 05:51 est , 3 june 2013 a new method of carrying out male circumcision without the need for surgery has been approved by the @entity6			1
the @entity8 circumcision device uses an elastic band to cut off the blood supply to the foreskin until it dies and falls off , or can be cut off painlessly			1
it is hoped the device will help to reduce the spread of @entity15 in @entity16 because being circumcised reduces a heterosexual man ’s risk of becoming infected by 60 per cent			1
the @entity8 device works by using an elastic band to cut off the blood supply to the foreskin which causes it to die meaning it falls off , or can be cut away painlessly			1
it takes two nurses just four minutes to fit the device the technique does not require a general anaesthetic and is believed to be safer than surgery			2
the @entity30 reports that the device can be put in place by two nurses who require little training , it only takes four minutes to apply , it is disposable , and there is no need for sterile conditions			1
it is also cheap compared to surgery and the device is easy to ship and store			0
the manufacturer also claims there are no needles involved and no loss of blood , the patient can return immediately to their daily routine , and it does not require the use of unsightly stitches or sutures			0
@entity53 , the social enterprise that created @entity8 , claims that 25 million people have already died of @entity56 and that another two million people are infected every year			2
in 2007 , the @entity6 reported that male circumcision in high risk parts of @entity60 can reduce the risk of hiv infection by 60 per cent			2
the reason for this is that the foreskin acts as @entity15 ’s main entry point to the body during penetrative sex between an uninfected man and an @entity15 - infected person			2
this is because the inner surface of the foreskin contains a higher proportion of the cells that @entity15 targets , such as t - cells			0
it is hoped that the device will slow the spread of @entity15 in @entity16 as heterosexual men in high - risk areas are 60 per cent less likely to become infected if they are circumcised it also has less keratin , a protein found in the skin , which has a protective effect			1
circumcision can also reduce the likelihood of genital ulcers , which increase @entity15 risk by creating a break in the skin through which the virus can enter the body			0
in addition , any small tears in the foreskin that occur during sex make it much easier for the virus to enter the body			0
however , surgical circumcision requires surgeons working in sterile surgical conditions – something which is often not available in the parts of @entity16 where @entity15 is most prevalent			1
in 2011 @entity107 , the @entity108 , the @entity6 , the @entity109 , and the @entity110 launched an action plan to carry out 20 million voluntary circumcisions by 2015			0
they believe this will save 3.4 million lives and us $ 16.5 billion in long term healthcare costs			0
@entity53 believes that the @entity8 offers a ‘ safe , simple and scalable ’ way of achieving this goal .			0

the @entity6 has approved the @entity8 device for use
it works by using an elastic band to cut off the blood supply to the foreskin
this causes it to die , meaning it falls off or can be cut away painlessly
takes two nurses four minutes to apply and does *n't* need sterile conditions
@entity136 hoped @entity8 will slow the spread of @entity15 in @entity16
men who are circumcised are around 60 *%* less likely to become infected
