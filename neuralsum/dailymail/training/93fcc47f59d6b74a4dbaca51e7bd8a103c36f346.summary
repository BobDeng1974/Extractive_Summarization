so , when the day came , he donned the shadow warriors ' distinctive black apparel , face covered in the manner of the medieval assassins , strapped a plastic sword to his back , and hopped on his bike			1
but as he pedalled the @entity25 , @entity27 seafront on his way to work at the @entity29 , a startled member of the public took fright and dialled 999			2

' i just said " it ’s a costume , it ’s a toy " while i had my arms in the air			2
the officers were from the armed response unit , they had tasers			0
' i kept as calm as i possibly could but i was quite scared			0
