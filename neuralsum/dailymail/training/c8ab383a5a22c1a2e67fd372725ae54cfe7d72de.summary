by @entity0 published : 04:40 est , 19 march 2013 updated : 06:26 est , 19 march 2013 a @entity2 actress has been digitally recreated as part of a groundbreaking virtual head that could replace the text emoticons we use today			1
researchers say the interactive computer face , based on 31 - year - old soap actress @entity9 , can display six emotions including happiness , anger , and fear			1
the lifelike figure , which generates voice and facial expressions from typed text , can combine these basic emotions to create hundreds of others			1
talking head : @entity2 actress @entity9 , 31 , is the basis for the most expressive ever talking head , just developed by researchers at @entity24 and tests showed that the virtual head 's emotions are so convincing that observers found it easier to read her emotions than those of the actress she is modelled on			1
researchers spent several days recording ms @entity9 's speech and facial expressions - best known as @entity37 in the @entity39 series @entity2			1
the new system - also called @entity9 - bears a striking resemblance to the ship 's computer in the @entity45 sci - fi comedy @entity46			1
its inventors say it could be used as a digital assistant for smartphones - or even as a more lifelike equivalent to the commonly used emoticons			1
for example , users could write the text message ' i 'm going to be late ' and ask the computer to set the emotion to frustrated			2
their friend would then receive a message with the computerised face repeating saying it in a frustrated way			0
future generations of the technology could even be personalised with users ' own faces and voices			0
it is hoped that the technology will also be used to help autistic and deaf children to read emotions and lip - read			2
expressive : researchers say the interactive computer face can display six emotions			0
@entity79 shows @entity9 making angry expression ; on the right , she is showing a sad expression researchers say the face is the most expressive controllable avatar ever created - replicating human emotions with unprecedented realism			1
' this technology could be the start of a whole new generation of interfaces which make interacting with a computer much more like talking to another human being , ' said @entity24 engineering professor @entity94			0
' it took us days to create @entity9 , because we had to start from scratch and teach the system to understand language and expression			2
' now that it already understands those things , it should n't be too hard to transfer the same blueprint to a different voice and face			0
' combinations : but the lifelike figure , which generates voice and facial expressions from typed text , can combine these basic emotions to create hundreds of others			1
@entity79 is a happy expression ; right , afraid he added : ' present day human - computer interaction still revolves around typing at a keyboard or moving and pointing with a mouse			2
' for a lot of people , that makes computers difficult and frustrating to use			0
' in the future , we will be able to open up computing to far more people if they can speak and gesture to machines in a more natural way			0
' that is why we created @entity9 - a more expressive , emotionally responsive face that human beings can actually have a conversation with			1
' the future of communication ? its inventors say it could be used as a digital assistant for smartphones - or even as a more lifelike equivalent to the commonly used emoticons tests showed the computer @entity9 was an even better actress than the real @entity145 , with 77 per cent of people recognising the virtual expressions compared to 73 per cent recognising the actress 's expressions the researchers created mathematical algorithms which gave them the voice and image data they needed to recreate expressions on the digital face from text alone			1
@entity9 's voice has six basic settings - happy , sad , tender , angry , afraid and neutral			1
tv star : @entity9 , 31 , plays the role of @entity37 in the @entity39 soap opera @entity2 the user can adjust these settings to different levels , as well as altering the pitch , speed and depth of the voice			1
by combining the levels it is possible to create a practically infinite amount of emotional reactions			0
combining happiness with tenderness and slightly increasing the speed and depth of the voice , for example , makes it sound friendly and welcoming			0
and a combination of speed , anger and fear makes @entity9 sound as if she is panicking			0
@entity9 has performed well in tests with researchers getting a 77 per cent success rate of 20 volunteers recognising the emotion she was displaying			0
bizarrely the recognition rate for the real - life ms @entity9 was only 73 per cent			2
the program used to run @entity9 is just tens of megabytes in size meaning it can be easily incorporated into even the smallest computer devices , including tablets and smartphones			2
the head is the result of collaboration between researchers at @entity202 's @entity201 and the @entity24 's @entity203			0
futuristic @entity205 comedy @entity46 , starring @entity206 , ran for eight series over an eleven year period before it was axed in 1999			0
but the series returned in 2008 , with a three - episode production was commissioned by the digital channel @entity212 and a new series in october 2012 .			0

system generates voice and facial expression from typed text
based on @entity2 actress @entity9 - and it 's also called @entity9
can replicate wide range of human emotions with high level of realism
potential digital assistant for smartphones , ' face messaging ' and more
next - gen *software* will allow users to personalize with own face and voice
