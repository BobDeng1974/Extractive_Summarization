76 - year - old @entity5 died on saturday , two weeks after being hospitalised			1
serving as president of @entity14 , @entity5 was described by his family as ' an amazing dad , husband and grandpa '			2
he becomes the 27th person to be killed by the mosquito - borne virus in the @entity22 , of 694 cases - the sharpest spike in case numbers seen since 2004 that is baffling experts			1
. ' it is not clear why we are seeing more activity than in recent years , ' @entity28 of the @entity29 told @entity33			2
' regardless of the reasons for the increase , people should be aware of the west nile virus activity in their area and take action to protect themselves and their family			2
' there is no medication to treat @entity10 virus , symptoms of which include fever , headache , body aches , joint pains , vomiting , diarrhea or rash			1
no vaccinations exist , either			0
the majority of cases have been recorded in @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
in @entity59 panic has deepened since a judge declared the epidemic to be a public health emergency			2
an aerial assault was launched on the blood - sucking insect population for the first time in 45 years in a bid to combat the spread			1
aircraft loaded with insecticide have sprayed parts of the north east of @entity72 , after the virus killed 10 people and left at least 230 more ill. although commonplace in other major cities , the efforts have provoked a debate in the @entity59 area between health officials trying to reduce the risk of disease and residents concerned about the dangers posed by the chemical cloud drifting down from above them			1
preparing for action : an aircraft carrying insecticide is loaded with fuel before taking off to spray parts of @entity72 as part of the battle against the spread of the @entity10 virus battle : an aircraft sprays insecticide over part of @entity72 ' i can not have any more deaths on my conscience because we did not take action , ' @entity59 mayor @entity98 said			1
aerial spraying is also being used elsewhere , including in neighborhoods in @entity106 and @entity107 , @entity108 , to combat the spread of @entity10 virus			1
cases of @entity10 have also been reported in the @entity112 area , with officials spraying the nearby town of @entity115 with insecticide			1
two people have been taken ill with the virus in @entity115 , while the @entity112 suburb of @entity120 has reported its first case			2
state of emergency : the culex quinquefasciatus mosquito is associated with transmission of the @entity10 virus nearly half of all @entity10 cases in the @entity22 so far this year are in @entity55 , however , according to the @entity29			1
if the trend continues , 2012 will be the worst @entity10 year in the southern state 's history			1
the hot , dry weather has created ideal conditions for some species of mosquito			1
the heat speeds up their life cycle , which accelerates the virus 's replication process			2
and during a drought , standing water can quickly turn stagnant when it 's not flushed away by rain or runoff			0
@entity59 mayor @entity98 , pictured with his wife @entity144 , has declared a state of emergency in his city parts of north @entity59 are being sprayed with insecticide to combat the spread of the virus a gravid trap ( left ) , in a field near @entity152 in @entity59 , is part of the mosquito control efforts by the @entity157 first lieutenant @entity156 ( right ) examines a mosquito through a microscope at the @entity160 in @entity161 ( file picture ) @entity163 , mosquito technician at @entity165 , holds a trap while collecting mosquitoes covering up : @entity168 is seen wading into waist - deep water to guide protective tarps over koi ponds at the @entity172 ponds ' protection : the arboretum had crews out working to cover about 8,000 square feet of ponds with tarps to protect the aquatic ecosystems from insecticide that will be sprayed over the city from aircraft both the mayor and @entity72 judge @entity184 have declared a state of emergency and voiced their support for the use of aircraft to battle the virus			1
yet even with the threat of infection , the spraying has sparked widespread opposition from people who fear the chemicals could be harmful			2
because of the severity of the outbreak , the @entity196 is stepping in to oversee the effort and to pay for it			0
research : mosquito technician @entity202 looks through the mosquitos as local , state and federal officials are set to meet to discuss options for responding to the growing number of @entity10 cases prevention : the mosquitoes seen in a laboratory will help researchers fight the disease 's spread sorting : these dead mosquitoes await sorting at the @entity72 mosquito lab ' this year is totally different from the experience @entity55 has had in the past , ' state health commissioner dr. @entity216 said			1
' if it 's nuisance mosquitoes , we ask the city or county to pay part of that			2
but in the midst of this disease outbreak , it 's easier for us to go ahead and do it			0
' a national spraying company called @entity230 was set to deploy two to five @entity232 twin - engine planes for three hours of spraying			2
close eye : mosquito tech @entity234 is seen sorting the mosquitoes beneath a microscope at the @entity72 mosquito lab critics have questioned whether the approach is scientifically proven to reduce @entity10 cases			1
but at least one study in @entity108 concluded that the odds of infection are about six times lower in treated areas than in those that are untreated			0
still , some residents fear the chemicals could harm their children , pets and useful insects such as honeybees and ladybugs			0
plans : @entity59 mayor @entity98 talks about aerial spraying to curb the spread of @entity10 virus while standing before one of the @entity232 aircraft being used to administer the insecticide @entity262 areas : a map of @entity72 highlights the areas that were planned to be sprayed by air on thursday night @entity266 released from the planes , synthetic pyrethroid , mimics a naturally occurring substance found in chrysanthemums			1
the @entity271 has said that pyrethroids do not pose a significant risk to wildlife or the environment , though no pesticide is 100 percent safe			0
about eight - tenths of an ounce of chemical is applied per acre			0

stronger strains of the virus can inuce nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea			0
the most dangerous form can lead to unconsciousness , sometimes approaching near - coma , and death			0
up to 80 per cent of human infections do not show any symptoms			0
@entity10 emerged as a distinct virus around 1,000 years ago , developing into two distinct forms			1
one has been transmitted in @entity316 and around the world , while the other has been confined to @entity316 - although it has been recently detected in horses @entity319			0
the label says it 's toxic to fish and other types of aquatic life , and it contains distilled petroleum			0
@entity326 , who lives in @entity59 and works for an environmental consulting firm , has questioned the move			2
' one ounce an acre does n't sound like much , but we will spray at least 2,000 gallons all over the city , ' @entity326 said			0
' a 2,000 - gallon oil spill would be significant			0
' i 'm concerned that we 're breeding resistant mosquitoes that next time will have @entity337 fever or something worse			2
' @entity340 , which includes humid , mosquito - filled @entity341 , has used aerial spraying once a year since 2002 , the year the virus was first detected in @entity55			1
' we ca n't be everywhere at all times , ' mosquito control director dr. @entity343 said			0
' aerial treatment is a way to supplement what we do on the ground			0
' most people infected with @entity10 virus wo n't get sick , but about one in 150 people will develop the severe form of the illness			1
symptoms include headache , high fever , neck stiffness , disorientation , coma , tremors , convulsions , muscle weakness and paralysis			0
@entity364 , 14 , spent eight days in intensive care with the most severe form of @entity10 virus			1
her mother , @entity367 of @entity369 , said she does n't approve of aerial spraying and wishes local leaders would do more to educate the community			0
' we 've been desensitized to @entity10 virus , ' mrs @entity367 said			1
' it 's been ingrained in us that it affects older people and infants			0
' i think they need to pass out insect repellent , mention it in back - to - school drives			0

76 - year - old @entity5 died on saturday , two weeks after being hospitalised
27 people have been killed by the virus , of 694 recorded cases
@entity389 used to spray mosquitoes with insecticide over @entity59 for the first time in nearly 50 years
around half of all cases of @entity10 in the @entity22 this year have been in @entity55
hot , dry weather has created an ideal environment for the mosquitoes to breed
