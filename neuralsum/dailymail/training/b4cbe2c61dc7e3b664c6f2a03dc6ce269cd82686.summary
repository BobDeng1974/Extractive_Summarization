i know them very well and it is incredibly hard to be in their company , because they are so distraught			2
it is hard to be near them because they are so devastated			0
' i can tell you that they are grieving for those who 've lost their lives before their own son			2
they really are , that 's where they are			2
i ca n't imagine the confusion there must be in that ? ' these are eloquent people and they can hardly get a sentence out			0
' speaking about the family and his own interactions with @entity3 , he said : ' i have been with them from the very start of all this			1
they are great people and close friends			2
' i always looked forward to coming to @entity1 because there was n’t a moment when they did n't want to entertain you			0
and they had a kid , a kid called @entity3			1
heartbroken : @entity85 is seen on saturday , the day after his son went on a murderous rampage ripped apart : @entity85 is pictured left with his daughter @entity88			1
@entity89 , @entity88 and her mother , @entity9			1
the parents are said to be more devastated about the six other victims than about the death of their own son ' he was painfully shy , could n't look at you straight in the eye and looked at your feet			1
if you asked me last week i would have said he was one of the most reserved , self - contained guys you could ever meet			0
family friend @entity28 ' i remember a couple of @entity105 ago i was having dinner with them			2
i went outside for a breather and there was @entity3 , on his own and he was the loneliest figure i think i have ever seen			1
' i remember thinking at the time , he was totally alone , a figure of solitude			0
i apologized and asked if i was interrupting and walked away			0
he was that kind of shy guy who you never talked to because he was so on his own you felt you were intruding even asking him a question			0
' and he insisted his friends had done everything they possibly could to avert the massacre , even racing up to the campus to try to intervene after seeing his chilling @entity123 video in which he reveals his bloody plans			0
victims : @entity3 's first victims included his roommates @entity128 , left , and @entity129 , right gunned down : @entity130 , left , was also found stabbed to death in their home - although he did not live at the house - while @entity135 gunned down @entity136 , right , when he opened fire at a deli loss : @entity139 , left , and @entity140 were standing outside a sorority house when they were shot mr @entity28 said : ' he was in therapy from the age of nine and to the very last moment they were in a chase to save their son			1
they raced up to try to save him , it 's everyone 's nightmare			2
you 're driving up to @entity17 and you hear a black @entity154 is involved			0
' @entity28 since the shocking incident it has been revealed that police had contact with @entity3 three times while he was living in @entity160 , but they failed to see any warning signs			1
on one occasion , a family member called and asked officers to check on @entity3 because they were worried about his mental state			1
in his warped 141 - page manifesto , he describes the incident , saying : ' if they had demanded to search my room ... ( t ) hat would have ended everything			2
for a few horrible seconds , i thought it was all over ...			0
[ @entity174 ] he police would have searched my room , found all of my guns and weapons , along with my writings about what i plan to do with them			0
sadness : students mourn the students who were killed by @entity3 in a candlelit vigil at the weekend ' i would have been thrown in jail , denied of the chance to exact revenge on my enemies			1
i ca n't imagine a hell darker than that			0
' but @entity3 ’s parents do n't blame the authorities at all			1
mr @entity28 said : ' they do n't place any blame on the police , because @entity3 fooled everyone , no one knew the man he was turning into			1
' he seemed a sensitive guy , there was nothing aggressive about him , there was no anger			0
no one recognizes the person portrayed in the manifesto			2
he did n’t act in that way , he was just in his own world			0
he did n’t once speak about guns			0
' if you look at the amount of therapists they took him to , it is clear he did all he could			0
he 's writing with anger , but he constantly references how they tried to make him feel better			0

@entity8 and @entity9 are more distraught about the deaths of their son 's six victims , a close friend told @entity223
the friend added that @entity3 was always quiet and on his own
on the day of the killings , his parents rushed to find him after receiving his manifesto but heard about his shooting spree on the radio
