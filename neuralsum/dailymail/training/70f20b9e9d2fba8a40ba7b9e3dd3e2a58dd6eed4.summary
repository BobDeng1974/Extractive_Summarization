by @entity0 published : 13:01 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 14:33 est , 6 march 2014 the asteroid , named p / 2013 @entity3 , was first spotted by the @entity5 and @entity6 sky survey in september an asteroid breaking up in space has been filmed for the first time			1
@entity11 images of the giant rock self - destructing over a period of several months were captured by astronomers			1
it smashed into ten smaller pieces which will eventually disintegrate into fragments , a few of which will one day reach @entity21 's atmosphere as meteors and burn up in the sky			1
up to 365 metres wide , each with ' tails ' caused by dust lifted from their surfaces and pushed back by the pressure of sunlight , they are drifting apart slowly ruling out a spectacular collision with another asteroid			1
analysis of the pictures taken by @entity36 's @entity35 3 suggests the space rock may be spinning fast enough to burst apart			0
professor @entity38 , of the @entity39 , @entity40 , said : ' seeing this rock fall apart before our eyes is pretty amazing			0
' the crumbling asteroid , named @entity3 , was first spotted by the @entity5 and @entity6 sky survey telescopes last 15 september and regarded as an unusual , fuzzy looking object			1
two weeks later it was spotted by the @entity48 on @entity49 revealed three bodies moving together embedded in a dusty envelope almost as wide as @entity21			1
professor @entity38 said : ' the @entity48 telescope showed us this asteroid was worth looking at with @entity36			0
' its superior resolution revealed there were really 10 embedded objects , each with comet - like dust tails			1
the four largest rocky fragments are up to 365 metres wide			1
this picture was taken in october 2013 scientists do not think the asteroid was destroyed in a collision with another object because the way it is breaking apart			2
they also think it is unlikely the asteroid fell to pieces due to pressure of interior ice warming			2
instead , they said the break - up was probably the result of the effect of sunlight over many years causing the asteroid to spin until it became unstable and ruptured			1
this phenomenon , known as the @entity93 effect , has been debated by scientists , but never previously observed			0
the @entity36 data published in @entity96 found the fragments are drifting away from each other at just a mile an hour - less than walking pace			2
the asteroid began disintegrating early last year , but new pieces continue to emerge			2
it is unlikely to have been hit by another asteroid because the impact would have been much more violent			0
the most likely explanation for its breakup is the effect of sunlight , which increases the rotation rate causing centrifugal force to pull the asteroid apart			1
this possibility , known as ' @entity93 torque ' has been discussed by scientists for several years but , so far , never reliably observed			0
the asteroid began disintegrating last year , but new pieces continue to emerge			0
it 's unlikely to have been hit by another asteroid because the impact would have been more violent			0
here is it is pictured on 15 november the most likely explanation for its breakup is the effect of sunlight , which increases the rotation rate causing centrifugal force to pull the asteroid apart			1
the the asteroid is pictured on 13 december for this to happen , p / 2013 @entity3 must have a weak , fractured interior , probably as the result of a number of ancient but non-destructive collisions with other asteroids			1
most small asteroids , in fact , are thought to have been severely damaged in this way , giving them a ' rubble pile ' internal structure			0
p / 2013 @entity3 itself is probably the product of collisional shattering of a bigger body some time in the last billion years			1
the asteroid 's remnant debris , weighing in at 200,000 tons , in the future will provide a rich source of meteoroids			0
most will eventually plunge into the sun , but a small fraction of the debris may one day enter the @entity21 's atmosphere to blaze across the sky as meteors			2
here is is pictured on 14 january with @entity36 's recent discovery of another active asteroid spouting six tails , astronomers are seeing more circumstantial evidence the pressure of sunlight may be the primary force that disintegrates small asteroids less than a mile across in the solar system			0

professor @entity38 co-discovered the @entity174 beyond @entity175 in 1993			0
the area , which contains more than a billion objects and was once believed to be empty space , has fundamentally changed the modern perception of the solar system .			0

the asteroid , named p / 2013 @entity3 , broke up over a period of several months
it smashed into 10 pieces and some fragments will one day reach @entity21
each piece has a comet - like dust tail and the largest is 365 metres wide
one explanation for breakup is the effect of sunlight , which increases its rotation speed causing the asteroid to pull apart
