a technical glitch delayed the social networking company 's market debut by 30 minutes on friday and many client orders were delayed , giving some investors and traders significant losses as the stock price dropped			1
the exchange operator is facing lawsuits from investors and threats of legal action from brokers			2
@entity24 : @entity4 may lose the @entity6 listing entirely after having just obtained it four of the top market makers in the @entity5 - @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity32 's @entity31 - collectively have probably lost more than $ 100million from problems arising from the deal , said a senior executive at one of the firms			1
@entity28 and @entity29 are each claiming losses of $ 30million to $ 35million , potentially overwhelming a $ 13 million fund the exchange set up to deal with potential claims			1
@entity4 also has to contend with the outside prospect that it could lose the @entity6 listing entirely after having just obtained it			1
@entity6 shares ended regular trading on thursday up 3.2 per cent at $ 33.03 , about $ 5 short of their offering price			1
mishap : a technical glitch at @entity4 delayed @entity6 's market debut by 30 minutes on friday and many client orders were delayed , giving some investors and traders significant losses as the stock price dropped action on the stock , however , has essentially become secondary to the fallout from the @entity5 - its price , its size , its execution and questions about selective disclosure of its financial prospects			1
regulators including the @entity66 , the @entity67 and massachusetts secretary of the commonwealth @entity68 are now looking into how the ipo was handled			1
the @entity70 is also reviewing the @entity71 familiar with the situation said many investors are now finding out , nearly a week after the fact , that their orders were not executed at the prices they thought			1
@entity78 , in a statement , said it was working with regulators and market makers on its clients ' issues ' and we will continue to do so until we are confident that @entity4 has done everything it can to mitigate the impact to our customers			0
' decline : one prominent plaintiffs lawyer said what happened with @entity6 was reminiscent of the dot - com bubble @entity93 is also still tending to trade orders placed by brokerage customers on friday , two people familiar with the situation said			1
@entity4 has said all orders were returned by 1:50pm edt last friday , but a @entity98 source said it did not get trade information in a ' systemic , orderly way			2
late thursday , the company held a call with its brokers and told them adjustments would be made to thousands of trades so that no limit orders would be filled at more than $ 43 a share for stock from the ipo day , a person familiar with the call said			1
while brokerages may have received confirmation of trades made on friday , many were still handling customer disputes over what price they received on the trades , officials said			0
the question is ' who is going to eat the cost ' of compensating those investors , said @entity123 , a financial adviser with @entity125 - based @entity124 , which has $ 200 million in assets			1
one prominent plaintiffs lawyer said what happened with @entity6 was reminiscent of the dot - com bubble			1
' this is just another spin on the same game of unfair treatment of individual investors , ' said @entity135 of @entity136			2
he chaired the plaintiffs ' committee in an @entity5 class - action suit challenging the role of investment banks in more than 300 ipos between 1998 and 2000			2
the litigation ended in a $ 586 million settlement in favor of the @entity146 claims by market makers @entity28 and @entity29 could end up dwarfing some of the brokerage issues , though			1
' they are certainly facing the specter of some significant lawsuits if this pool is not enough , ' a source familiar with @entity28 's situation said of the @entity4 claims pool			0
@entity29 has sent its losses to @entity4 for potential compensation , a source familiar with the matter said			0
@entity29 's hedge fund was not affected			0
the head of trading at @entity163 said it still had no idea when @entity4 would respond to requests for accommodation - essentially , compensation for the order problems - or if those requests would be honoured			0
cleaning up : @entity6 's ipo has caused a mess that is currently being investigated by two congressional panels ' were gon na be looking at a loss on our books ' if @entity4 does not honor the requests , @entity173 said			1
' we basically made most of our clients whole because @entity4 told us to go through the process and file for accommodation			0
if @entity4 does not accommodate us we 're going to end up taking a loss			0
' ' i do n't know that i want to put a dollar amount on that but it 's not nearly as significant as @entity28 's ( $ 30 - $ 35 million ) , ' he said			2
@entity29 and @entity28 , as market makers to the @entity4 , honor their clients ' buy , sell and cancellation orders			0
the orders are supposed to be processed by the exchange within milliseconds , but there was a nearly two - hour delay in processing @entity6 orders at the @entity4			2
during that time , market makers had no idea where their orders stood			0
and in reality , the price clients bought or sold at was sometimes different than the price they actually got			0
for example , @entity6 shares began trading with an opening cross price - the first price at which those not in on the ipo could buy or sell - of $ 42 per share			1
if an order to sell 10,000 shares at $ 42 went in at that time , but was n't filled until later in the day when shares were trading at around $ 39 , a market maker like @entity29 or @entity28 would make up the difference - in this case , at a cost of $ 30,000.fewer problems @entity218 analysts who cover exchanges said @entity4 's legal liability should be limited , though			2
according to the analysts , securities rules give @entity4 wide discretion in determining what , if any , compensation it should pay to customers who claim that they suffered losses due to trading execution			0
under exchange rules , @entity4 's liability regarding client losses from certain trading issues is limited to $ 3 million a month			2
market makers will be arguing that @entity4 was so grossly negligent that its actions during the ipo opening override the limits , said a source with knowledge of @entity28 's situation			0
zucked : @entity239 saved $ 174 million by cashing out tens of millions of shares of @entity6 stock early friday when the price was above $ 38 a share other firms said they did not have similar problems to those of @entity28 , raising questions about the scope of the losses			1
' the problems were where people were trying to cancel orders ; we did n't have that , ' said @entity255 , equity strategist at @entity256 in @entity257			0
' because we did n't have a problem does n't mean there were n't problems			0
' @entity261 said its market making operations realized losses of ' well under a million dollars			0
' @entity265 had a ' small number ' of the ' tens of thousands of clients ' who traded @entity6 whose issues still have not been resolved , a spokesman said			2
' each one requires some analysis to resolve , which can be time consuming			0
' shares of @entity4 fell 1 cent to $ 21.80 on thursday			2
as of thursday 's close the stock was down 5.2 per cent from its last close before the @entity6 debacle			1
over the same period @entity280 is down just 0.1 per cent			0
