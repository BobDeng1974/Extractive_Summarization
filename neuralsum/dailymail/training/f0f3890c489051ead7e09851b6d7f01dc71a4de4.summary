border officials have come up with a new way of encouraging illegal immigrants to go home : asking them nicely			1
a £ 10,000 advertising campaign designed to tempt illegal immigrants to leave the @entity5 without facing arrest and deportation was launched yesterday – and immediately branded ‘ breathtakingly stupid ’			1
it is the latest attempt by the @entity9 to target nearly 200,000 people thought to have stayed in @entity5 illegally after their visas expired			1
ministers said the campaign offered migrants an ‘ alternative to being led away in handcuffs ’			0
the advert states : ‘ in the @entity5 illegally ? go home or face arrest			1
text home to 78070 for free advice , and help with travel documents			2
we can help you return home voluntarily without fear of arrest or detention			0
’ @entity29 : vans bearing signs asking illegal immigrants to text the government are being driven around @entity33 vans carrying campaign posters will be driven around @entity33 over the coming days , carrying a warning message for illegal migrants			1
the advert calls for illegal immigrants to text ‘ home ’ to 78070			1
if they do , the @entity9 will give them free advice on how to go home , and help getting a new passport if they need one			0
however the advert also comes with a warning – that anyone who refuses to go will face arrest			2
a source said it was ‘ a lot cheaper getting them on an @entity51 flight than spending £ 11,000 removing someone from the country ’			0
officials said the campaign , which cost £ 10,000 , would pay for itself if just one migrant returned home			2
but @entity59 mp @entity58 said : ‘ the breathtaking stupidity of the people in charge of our immigration system knows no bounds			2
overstayed : the @entity9 believes 200,000 people may still be in the @entity5 after their visas have expired ‘ if they still made @entity68 , then @entity69 would be proposing this			1
‘ it actually is an indication of a weakness that we ’re having to implore people to leave the country			2
the fact is there is absolutely zero effort made by law enforcement agencies to get people out when they have come in to the country unlawfully			0
’ ‘ it ’s also a measure of their desperation			0
’ in addition to the advert , leaflets carrying the same message will be left in newsagents , money transfer shops and internet cafes migrants are known to go to , and adverts placed in local newspapers			0
two vans will be driven around @entity97 , @entity98 & @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 this week showing the advert and displaying figures on how many illegal migrants have been arrested recently in each area			2
help : illegal immigrants who text the new number will be offered free advice on how to get back home immigration minister @entity112 said : ‘ we are making it more difficult for people to live and work in the @entity5 illegally			1
every single day our enforcement officers are arresting , detaining and removing people with no right to be in the @entity5			1
‘ but there is an alternative to being led away in handcuffs			0
help and advice can be provided to those who cooperate and return home voluntarily			0
‘ this pilot is just another part of the reforms of the immigration system that have cut out abuse and seen net migration drop to its lowest levels in nearly a decade			0
the @entity131 being introduced later this year will build on this work by restricting illegal migrants ’ access to benefits and services			0
’ more than 28,000 illegal migrants returned home voluntarily last year – but official estimates suggest there are nearly 200,000 illegal overstayers still in the country after their visas have expired .			1
