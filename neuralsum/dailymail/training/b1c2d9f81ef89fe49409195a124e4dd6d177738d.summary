@entity0 has called on his @entity2 players to ‘ stand up and deliver ’ as he prepares for a hostile afternoon at @entity3 with one protest group having printed 35,000 cards demanding he be sacked			1
the @entity7 – beaten 4 - 0 at @entity8 last weekend to leave them propping up the @entity10 table - face @entity11 on saturday			1
before the match the people behind the website sackpardew.com will attempt to distribute the @entity16 cards calling for the manager to be dismissed			2
@entity0 's @entity2 have performed poorly since january when they sold @entity18 @entity2 fans have never really taken to @entity0 and are now calling for his head they hope the cards – and upwards of 200 anti-pardew banners – will then be displayed inside the stadium			1
tyneside - based firm printnortheast told @entity26 they were happy to provide the 35,000 cards free of charge in support of the protest			1
however , we understand the demonstration will not force owner @entity33 into ending @entity0 ’s four - year tenure and he will be given time to turn results around , regardless of the outcome against @entity11			1
the @entity2 boss , though , wants his under - performing players to snap from their early - season slumber and ease the pressure on himself this weekend			1
‘ i do n’t know about patience , this is a time to stand up and deliver really , ’ said @entity0 when asked if his side – with seven summer signings – needed time to gel			1
‘ saturday is an important game for us because we ’ve had a difficult start			2
‘ even if we ’d got a point ( at @entity8 ) it would have been an okay start because i think we ’ve had some tough games			2
‘ but now we have a game at home where the pressure is really going to be on us			0
’ @entity2 owner @entity33 handed @entity0 an eight - year contract less than two years ago @entity56 has been strongly linked with replacing @entity0 should the position come available @entity0 says that he takes responsibility for the start which has seen @entity60 pick up just two points from four games , as he reflected on the horror show at @entity64 ’s during which fans chanted throughout for him to go			1
‘ it was a tough day to take , ’ he said			0
‘ as a group and individually we ’re better than that , and i take responsibility for that			0
‘ it was a heavy defeat when we were looking for so much more			0
it was a tough day for our fans , a tough day for the team and , certainly , a tough day for me			0
’ @entity2 conceded inside the first minute in their last home game – a 3 - 3 draw with @entity76 – and also fell behind early at @entity8			2
a repeat on saturday would intensify the poisonous atmosphere which is already anticipated			0
and @entity0 went on : ‘ we have spoken about how important making a good start is			1
‘ but that ’s something that we ca n’t do			0
we conceded very early against @entity76 as well			0
‘ that will put us on our guard for saturday to make sure it ’s something we do ( start well )			2
‘ the worry ( also ) is how many goals are we going to score ? we ’re aware of that			0
we need to find a formula which will get us some goals			0
