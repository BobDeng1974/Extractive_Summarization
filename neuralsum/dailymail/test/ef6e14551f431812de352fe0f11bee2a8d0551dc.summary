from alien coffins to fossilised lizards , conspiracy theorists believe they have found all manner of strange items in @entity6 's images of @entity7			1
now , one alien hunter claims to have spotted what he believes to be a bunker on the red planet , with armed people peering out of its windows			1
@entity15 says he made the ' stunning discovery ' in a photograph released by @entity6 and taken by the @entity7 rover opportunity			1
it was a massive panoramic window built in the inside wall of the crater , ' @entity15 told @entity39			1
' you can see a person behind the bunker 's window , ' the 58 - year - old added			1
he claims that the ' bunker ' ' could also be a corridor leading to a bigger bunker '			1
' also , not far from this bunker are missiles , rockets and structures deployed in a circle , ' he says			1
' bunkers have been spotted in previous @entity6 pictures , some might be caused by shadows or lack of resolution that does n't give enough detail to clearly see if the structure is a bunker or not , ' @entity62 , author of the @entity63 , told @entity64 @entity15 says he made the ' stunning discovery ' in a photograph released by @entity6 and taken by the @entity7 rover opportunity pictured from left to right , are structures , missiles and rockets @entity71 claims he found in @entity6 's image @entity71 claims he became curious about a ' dark spot ' on the rim of the @entity31 he had found in the original image , and so took a closer look ' others have claimed that bunker pictures were taken by the @entity80 , @entity82 orbital vehicle			1
' these were explained as being of erosional features or caused by the way the pictures were stitched together			2
' whatever the " mundane " explanation i think we are more fascinated by the idea that there are people secretly living beneath the surface of @entity7 and they are part of some secret space program			0
' such a project would need vast resources and would be very hard to keep covered up , yet many think this is what is happening and that these activities are being carried out in conjunction with one or more alien species			0
' the latest discovery follows a spate of supposed ' sightings ' of @entity7 civilisation			0
last year , a @entity107 - based @entity63 hunter spotted what he believed to be a ' decorative ' box on the red planet			1
other objects found in images of @entity7 include what some @entity63 hunters claim to be a fossilised iguana ( left )			2
stock image of an iguana is pictured right the so - called ' coffin ' was found by @entity119 from @entity120 as he trawled through a library of pictures sent back by the @entity7 rover curiosity			1
the image pictured inset has been edited the ' coffin ' was discovered by @entity119 from @entity120 as he trawled through a library of pictures sent back by the @entity7 rover curiosity			1
many scientists believe that seeing strange objects , such as a ' coffin ' on @entity7 , is simple a case of pareidolia			0
this is a psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random places			0
it is a form of @entity138 , which is when people see patterns or connections in unconnected data			0
there have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places , especially the faces of religious figures			0
many involve images of @entity153 , the @entity154 and the word @entity156			0
for example , in september 2007 a callus on a tree resembled a monkey , leading believers in @entity162 to pay homage to the @entity165 god			0
another famous instance was when @entity154 's face was a grilled cheese sandwich			2
images of @entity153 have even been spotted inside the lid of a jar of @entity172 and in a potato			2
' this little box sure does look like a modern coffin concrete liner , ' he wrote on his @entity177 channel			0
' as well as the stonework on the back part of the hill that looks like stairs or some left over stonework from some old civilisations constructions			0
' alien researcher @entity185 of the @entity186 said he believes the coffin was made from a stone - like substance			1
' what would it take to get @entity6 to turn the rover around and examine the contents of this box ? , ' he said			1
but while its strong lines have captured the imagination of @entity63 bloggers , scientists believe sightings such as this are down to a psychological phenomenon called @entity202			0
this describes the brain 's response to seeing faces and other significant objects in random places			2
it has evolved so that human eyes can spot faces within their environment , and to help them recognise friends in a crowd			0
scientists claim we also tend to use this ability to ' enrich our imagination ' and recognise meaningful shapes , even when they 're not there			2
' i stand ready to be convinced that i have possibly hallucinated			0
i wo n't mind being told that i 'm wrong , ' @entity222 says			0
last year , @entity63 enthusiasts claimed to have spotted @entity225 's head on the @entity7 surface			1
they say a panoramic image from 2005 taken by the @entity228 shows a rock shaped uncannily like his head			2

radical claim was made by 58 - year - old @entity234 , @entity15
spotted ' bunker ' in an image taken by the @entity6 rover opportunity
' you can see a person behind the bunker 's window , ' @entity15 claims
@entity6 expert says the ' bunker ' is simply *effect* of shadows in the image
