seven decades of separation has seen even the language of @entity2 split into two different dialects			0
the two countries , though enemies , are tied together by history , by family and by language - but only to a point			1
@entity10 have incorporated many @entity12 words and phrases into their language while isolated communist @entity15 has eliminated words with foreign origins and created homegrown substitutes			1
@entity15 defector @entity20 - ok ended up going without water during a meal in the @entity24 because she was too shy to admit she did n't understand the term ' self - service ' for those south of the divide , @entity12 - based words like ' shampoo , ' ' juice ' and ' self - service ' are common			1
but they mean absolutely nothing to defectors from the insular @entity15			2
when @entity37 - ok first arrived in @entity2 after her defection in 2002 , she was told by a waitress at a restaurant that water was ' self - service , ' an @entity12 phrase she had not heard before			2
she ended up going without water during her meal because she was too shy to admit she did n't understand			0
' i worried the waitress would look down on me , ' she told the @entity47			0
she started out working at restaurants but struggled to understand customers			0
' i thought they spoke a different language , ' she said			0
but she gradually picked up the new vocabulary and uses words like ' stress ' and ' claim ' that are not heard up in the @entity2			0
similarly , people in @entity58 are confused by homegrown @entity15 words like ' salgyeolmul , ' which literally translates to ' skin water ' - but is just ' lotion ' in the @entity24			1
the @entity64 's 70 - year split has created a widening linguistic divide that produces misunderstandings , hurt feelings and sometimes even laughter			0
the @entity2 's isolation near - worship of the ruling @entity71 ( pictured centre , leader @entity72 ) has also skewed the language the gap has grown so wide that about a third of everyday words used in the two countries are different , according to scholars			1
@entity2 are generally able to understand each other given that the majority of words and grammar are still the same but the differences show how language can change when one half of the country becomes an international economic powerhouse and the other isolates itself , suspicious of outside influences			2
the huge cultural influence of @entity93 through its military presence , business ties and @entity96 has flooded the @entity10 vernacular with words borrowed from @entity12			1
' @entity99 ' uses @entity12 words in non-standard ways , like ' handle ' for steering wheel , ' hand phone ' for cellphone and ' manicure ' for nail polish			1
in @entity15 's view , this is just further evidence that the @entity24 is an @entity93 cultural colony			2
the @entity2 's isolation and near - worship of the ruling @entity72 family has also skewed the language			2
@entity10 use the @entity12 loan word ' juice ' but @entity15 say ' danmul , ' or ' sweet water			1
' @entity10 watch a ' musical ' but @entity15 see a ' gamuiyagi , ' or ' music and dance story			1
' ' @entity120 ' is the revered title for @entity2 's founding leader and his son , but in the @entity24 it 's a historical term referring to a medieval regional or faction leader			0
the sea creatures that @entity10 call ' cuttlefish ' are known in @entity15 by the word @entity10 use for ' octopus			1
' the term ' elderly person ' is considered neutral in the @entity2 , but pejorative in the @entity24			0
@entity10 wash their hair with ' shampoo ' but @entity15 use ' meorimulbinu , ' or ' hair water soap			1
' the word ' dongmu ' is used in @entity15 to refer to a revolutionary colleague , but @entity10 seldom use the term			1
a ' dosirak ' is @entity10 word for a lunch box while @entity15 call it ' gwakbab			1
' @entity10 use the @entity12 loan phrase ' skin lotion ' but it 's ' salgyeolmul , ' or ' skin water ' in the @entity2			2
@entity145 have different spelling and pronunciation rules for the first syllable of some @entity15 words , so the common family name is ' @entity151 ' in the @entity24 but ' @entity152 ' in the @entity2			1
@entity10 often end their conversations with phrases like ' let 's have lunch someday ' or ' @entity157 for drinks soon , ' but @entity15 defectors who have just arrived often take those as literal invitations and expect a follow - up phone call to arrange the appointment			1
source : @entity47 ' @entity120 ' is the revered title for the @entity2 's founding leader and his son , @entity166 , the father of the current ruler , @entity166			0
but in the @entity24 it 's used to refer to a faction or local leader from centuries ago			0
misunderstandings can arise to seemingly innocuous @entity15 phrases like , ' let 's do lunch sometime , ' which those in the @entity24 frequently use as a friendly ending to conversations , even with casual acquaintances			2
but newly arrived @entity15 defectors take such invitations literally , and are often dismayed or offended when they do n't get a follow - up phone call			2
' if someone uses such empty words in @entity15 , they 'll see their relations with others cut off and be branded as a faithless person , ' said a defector who asked not to be identified because of worries that doing so would put family members in the @entity2 at risk			2
linguists say it takes about two years for @entity15 defectors to feel comfortable conversing in @entity2			0
over the past 10 years , there have been efforts to produce a joint dictionary containing 330,000 words from both countries - a rare example of co-operation			0
but as is often the case , political tensions have interfered with progress			0
the meetings only resumed last july after a more than four - year hiatus following the 2010 sinking of a @entity10 warship			0
a new round of meetings , tentatively set for last month , has n't been held as @entity15 bristled over the annual springtime joint @entity93 - @entity2 military drills			0
even language experts from the two countries can have trouble understanding each other			0
during last year 's meeting in @entity216 , @entity10 linguist @entity214 said he tried to explain how @entity10 use the @entity12 word ' glamour ' as a noun to refer to a voluptuous woman , but @entity15 scholars had difficulty understanding its usage .			1

two countries are tied together by history , by family and by language
but a third of everyday words used in the two countries are different
@entity10 incorporate @entity12 words and phrases into their language
but in communist @entity15 , words with foreign origins are eliminated
