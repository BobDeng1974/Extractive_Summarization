he was stripped of his @entity8 passport but appealed and yesterday won his case at the @entity24			1
judges said taking his passport away was unlawful because it left him ‘ stateless ’ – in effect without a home country			1
hard at work : coalitions forces in @entity5 were believed to be the target of @entity12 's plots @entity12 , whose case is legally aided , has already won more than £ 50,000 in compensation and legal costs from the @entity3 over his three - year detention in @entity5 by coalition forces			1
the court found his internment amounted to a breach of his right to liberty			0
now ministers face the prospect of having to issue a new passport and allow the father of eight and his family back in			2
mps reacted with fury to the judgment			0
@entity54 , a senior member of the @entity55 , said : ‘ the public will be entitled to think there is something extremely wrong with the law in a case like this – when it appears national security and public safety can not be properly taken into account			0
’ @entity65 , 56 , came to the @entity8 in 1992 with his first wife and sought asylum			1
in 1998 they and their four children were given the right to remain here indefinitely and in 2000 were given @entity8 nationality			2
at that point , he automatically lost his @entity5 passport because the laws of that country did not allow dual nationals			1
after divorcing his first wife he married again in 2002 and while still married took a third wife			0
he lives in @entity80 with his third wife and all eight of his children			0

using legal aid , he launched a series of appeals to try to get it back			0
he won his case at the @entity102 last year which ‘ reluctantly ’ ruled in his favour			0
one judge said the outcome was ‘ deeply unsatisfactory ’ because of the threat ministers say he poses to @entity8			0
judges were told the reason for stripping him of his passport was the ‘ atrocities ’ the @entity113 terrorist group he belonged to planned against coalition soldiers			1
he is accused of recruiting terrorists and smuggling explosives and detonators for roadside bombs			0
home secretary @entity121 appealed to the @entity24 , which yesterday ruled he must be given his passport back			1
lawyers for mrs may argued that @entity12 could have applied to the @entity5 authorities to restore his nationality and that he had a right to a new @entity5 passport			2
the court found that @entity8 law does not allow the secretary of state to strip someone of their passport if they do not have another – even if they could apply for one from another country			1
before the 2002 @entity138 ministers could make someone stateless if they were considered a sufficient threat to @entity8 , but that power was revoked			2
