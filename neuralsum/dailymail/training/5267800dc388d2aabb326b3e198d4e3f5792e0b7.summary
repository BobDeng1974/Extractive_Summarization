by @entity1 reporter published : 14:17 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 15:27 est , 29 january 2014 a leaked version of the @entity5 ’ cheerleading squad handbook has been labeled as ‘ unbelievably sexist ’ and ‘ illegal ’			2
excerpts from the secret etiquette handbook were obtained and published by the @entity8 , many of which outline how ‘ @entity11 ’ must behave while eating in public and socializing with team players			1
criticized for being more concerned with the raiderette ’s reputations than their safety , the handbook outlines rules for fraternizing with advice on how to avoid getting caught in a ‘ date rape ’ scandal – rather than how to avoid the assault itself			0
strict code : a handbook provided to the @entity5 ' ' @entity11 ' cheerleading squad has been leaked , and subsequently called - out for its ' unbelievably sexist ' rules in excerpts published by the paper , the squad handbook ’s dating advice reads : ‘ there have been a few relationships between the two groups that have resulted in a few happy marriages and lovely children			1
however , we have also had more situations where , quite frankly , the @entity5 organization and the @entity11 narrowly escaped ruined reputations			1
’ it continues : ‘ one such example concerns a player who gave @entity42 parties every year and many of the @entity11 attended			1
this same player was suspended from the team for drug use but also arrested for date rape			0
for you on the squad who have attended those parties , just think how narrowly you missed having your photo in all the local papers and / or being assaulted			0
’ of this , feminist - geared website @entity54 commented : ‘ the [ handbook ’s ] advice within is so obvious and condescending that it would really only be appropriate when attempting to advise an alien from outer space on how to act human			0
’ @entity62 has a similar outlook , and has labelled the etiquette guide as ‘ unbelievably sexist ’			1
according to the @entity8 , the @entity5 are one of the few @entity67 teams that allows dating among cheerleaders and players			2
but they do strongly discourage it , even threatening in the guide : ‘ some teams who previously had cheerleaders do not now have them ( @entity76 )			1
because of morality problems with their squads , they decided cheerleaders were too much trouble to deal with			2
’ ' the handbook ’s advice is so obvious and condescending that it would really only be appropriate when attempting to advise an alien from outer space ' it also includes lines like , ‘ there ’s not a female alive ( or male either ) who does n’t like attention			0
but you need to learn to deal with attention you receive from the public ( and especially the players ) without it getting out of hand and going to your head			0
’ the handbook advises the cheerleaders to find out if players are married before becoming their friends , saying that many will ' lie ' about their marital status and that it is the @entity11 's job to find out the truth			1
appearance is also one of the handbook 's main topics			0
cheerleaders are told to always be ready to make a lasting first impression by maintaining their appearance – a stipulation that includes a perfect manicure			2
raiderettes are instructed to keep nail polish remover pads in their cars in case of emergency			0
aside from cheering at home games , @entity11 are expected to make multiple personal appearances each season – some of which may involve eating an unsavory meal			1
in these cases the squad is advised : ‘ if you do n’t like your meal , try a little of everything and strategically move the rest around your plate			0
’ war of wages : a rookie cheerleader known as ' @entity137 ' has filed a suit against the team on her squad 's behalf , claiming that its cheerleaders are paid less than $ 5 per hour outlines for @entity11 salaries are also included in the guide , requiring cheerleaders to sign a contract that , according to squad members , makes them accept a wage that does not meet government - regulated hourly minimums - a payment that prompted a rookie raiderette known as ‘ @entity137 ’ to file a lawsuit against the team ’s owners last week on the squad ’s behalf			1
' just think how narrowly you missed having your photo in all the local papers and / or being assaulted ' according to the suit , @entity11 are paid less than the government minimum			1
dancers must attend practice three times per week , cheer at ten seasonal home games , conduct multiple personal appearances , and travel for special photo shoots			2
they are only paid for their appearances at games , at $ 125 per match – adding up to a total of $ 1,250 in seasonal earnings			2
when taking all of the unpaid practices , appearances , and additional time into account , @entity137 has estimated that she and her squad members are paid less than $ 5 an hour			0
her legal counsel has pointed out that it against the law to make dancers sign an already - illegal contract			0
it is also unlawful to only pay the dancers at the end of the season , rather than in incremental amounts			0
the @entity5 will not provide comment on the lawsuit or the leak of its @entity11 handbook .			1

the ' etiquette guide ' was leaked amid a lawsuit filed by cheerleaders last week
the lawsuit alleges that @entity11 are paid well under the national minimum wage
