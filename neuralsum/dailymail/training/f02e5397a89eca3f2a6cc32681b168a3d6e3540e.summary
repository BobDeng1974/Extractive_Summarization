by @entity1 reporter published : 14:55 est , 27 february 2014 @entity3 : 17:55 est , 27 february 2014 a sculpture depicting @entity5 as a homeless man sleeping on a bench outside a church has polarized opinion in a @entity11 town			1
the piece by @entity14 artist @entity13 was given to @entity16 's @entity15 in @entity17 by residents who wanted to honor a fellow church member , who passed away in 2007			1
and even before its arrival , it caused divided reactions			0
already versions of the sculpture , entitled ' @entity5 ' , were rejected by cathedrals in @entity26 and @entity27 , but last november pope @entity28 blessed and accepted it into @entity30			1
' we 're reminded of what our ultimate calling is as @entity14 , as people of faith , to do what we can individually and systematically to eliminate homelessness			1
part of a faith commitment is to care or the needy			0
' the bronze sculpture , which costs up to $ 2,975 depending on its size , shows a figure lying beneath a blanket , with his feet visible			1
they have scars from where he was nailed to the cross			0
a plaque next to it reads ' @entity5 ' and says that the inspiration came from @entity66 : 25			0
on his website , @entity13 says the sculpture is a ' representation that suggests @entity70 is with the most marginalized in our society '			1
approval : rev. @entity74 , the rector at the church , said it reminds people to look after the homeless closer to @entity79 : rev. @entity39 said the statue represents the most marginalized people in society dislike : but resident @entity84 said she did not think the sculpture represented @entity5 there is also space to sit on the bench , which makes it interactive , and other residents say they believe it has brought them closer to @entity79			1
' it brings me right up here with him , yeah , ' said @entity96			0
' it gives me an overwhelming sense of peace and comfort			0
' but resident @entity84 told @entity43 she called police the first time she drove by it			1
' i was concerned for the safety of the neighborhood , ' she said , adding that she did not like how it portrayed @entity5 as a ' vagrant '			0
' @entity5 is not a helpless person who needs our help , ' she said , ' we need someone who is capable of meeting our needs , not someone who is also needy			0
' famous fan : pope @entity28 is seen blessing a smaller version of the sculpture at the @entity117 last november @entity118 : the artist , @entity13 , is pictured left meeting the pope , who praised the sculpture creation : @entity13 , pictured , said the piece suggests ' @entity70 is with the most marginalized in our society ' despite some reservations , there are no plans to remove it			1
reverend @entity39 added to @entity131 : ' it 's here because it ’s wonderful art that reminds , with this beautiful ( church ) structure here , that our faith is expressed through our concern and care for the homeless			2
we think it ’s the perfect place for it			0
' in november , he took a wooden version of the same sculpture to the @entity117 to present it to @entity28			2
' the first thing he did when he saw my sculpture was pray , and then he blessed the piece , ' @entity13 told @entity150			2
' to have @entity28 bless your sculpture is one of the most amazing experiences possible			2
' the model will stay in one of the @entity117 houses , and the artist is hoping to find an outdoor location near to @entity160 for a full - sized bronze version			0

@entity165 sculpture by @entity14 artist @entity13 shows @entity5 beneath a blanket lying on a bench
last year , cathedrals in @entity26 and @entity27 rejected versions of the sculpture , but pope @entity28 accepted one into @entity30
the rector at the church in @entity17 , @entity11 believes it represents those who are marginalized in society and reminds people to care
but some residents say it does not represent @entity5 - and have even called the police after thinking it was a real man
