by @entity0 published : 18:19 est , 26 december 2012 updated : 11:18 est , 27 december 2012 hundreds of gun owners are exchanging their firearms for gift cards to buy groceries in @entity5 in a buyback program aiming to get weapons off the streets			1
lines of cars and people stretched around the block in the first hours of the exchange on wednesday morning to take advantage of a guns - for - groceries exchange program that was moved up in the wake of the @entity18 school shooting			1
police officers filled bins with a variety of rifles and handguns outside the @entity24 and the @entity26 @entity25			1
' no @entity51 checks , we 're not taking down license plates , people drive up , they have a gun in their trunk , we have one of our gun experts take that gun out , make sure it 's safe , they walk over , get a gift card , and away they go			2
it 's very quick and painless , ' @entity62 @entity61 told @entity64 @entity5			2
handguns , rifles and shotguns could be exchanged for $ 100 @entity69 gift cards			1
assault weapons earned a $ 200 card			1
officials were mindful of both the massacre of students and teachers in @entity76 , @entity18 , as well as a gunman 's ambush that killed two firefighters in @entity80 , @entity81 on @entity82			0
@entity83 received : a police officer walks away with three rifles received by the program that had already pulled in hundreds of firearms in the first hours tragic inspiration : police officers load bins containing guns onto a truck during the gun buyback whose date was moved up after the mass shooting at @entity96 earlier this month positive effect : since the program 's creation in 2009 , there has been a 39 per cent drop in gang crimes and 22 per cent drop in calls reporting shots being fired ' all of us are still mourning the tragedy at @entity76 , @entity18 , ' said mayor @entity108			1
' so many young innocent children were mass - murdered in the way that they were , and now the assassination of two firefighters ... just breaks the heart of so many of us , particularly in this holiday season			0
' the program was originally scheduled for may but in wake of the december 14th shooting rampage at @entity96 , mr @entity108 decided to do it now			2
the last buyback program netted about 1,700 guns			2
since the program 's creation in 2009 , there has been a 39 per cent drop in gang crimes and 22 per cent drop in calls reporting shots being fired according to police			0
process : when drivers pulled up the unloaded weapons would be removed from their trunks by gun inspectors before they were taken away and a gift card presented in exchange worth : a police officer inspects one of the guns where automatic weapons would receive a $ 200 grocery store gift card and shotguns , handguns and rifles $ 100 gift cards argument : a report by the @entity147 in 2004 argued that exchanges like this one typically collect weapons least likely to be used in criminal activities @entity151 , a participant in the program earlier in the day , was asked what inspired her to stop by with her weapons			1
she had this to say to @entity64 : ' to turn in some ammunition , and guns that may be stolen from our house and you know someone may do something really bad with them			0
and that 's why i 'm turning them in			0
' in 2004 a report by the @entity147 , however , argued the exchange 's positive effect on gun violence			0
it found : ' the theory underlying gun buyback programs is badly flawed and the empirical evidence demonstrates the ineffectiveness of these programs ' they argued that the majority of guns received are those least likely to be used in criminal activities			0
they consisted of guns that are old , malfunctioning , or those owned by people with express little value in owning a gun .			0

program offers $ 100 grocery store gift cards for handguns , rifles and shotguns and $ 200 cards for assault weapons
in the first hours they reported netting nearly 500 fire arms and 31 assault weapons between two @entity5 locations
