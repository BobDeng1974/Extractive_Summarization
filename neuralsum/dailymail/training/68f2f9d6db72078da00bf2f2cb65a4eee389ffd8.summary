by @entity0 the first openly gay football player to be drafted by the @entity2 has prompted backlash after the moment when he kissed his boyfriend was broadcast across @entity6			1
@entity7 celebrated his selection by the @entity9 by hugging and kissing his partner , former @entity11 varsity swimmer @entity10 , knowing that the @entity6 cameras were there waiting for his reaction			1
for some viewers , it showed joy and others took it as an offense			0
for the networks that carried and repeatedly aired the scene , it was business as usual			0
the call : both @entity7 and his boyfriend @entity10 cried tears of joy as they received the good news and would soon share a kiss that made pro sports history celebratory : @entity7 and his boyfriend kissed in front of the @entity6 cameras which were broadcasting the moment nationally historic : @entity7 was in his agent 's @entity39 home when he received the call on saturday producer @entity42 , who oversees @entity2 draft coverage for @entity6 , said that in the extensive preparation for @entity7 's possible draft , they never thought that it was a possiblity that they should account for - in spite of the fact that straight players regularly kiss their significant others once being drafted			1
‘ we never had one discussion about , " what if he 's drafted , his partner 's there and they kiss ? " honestly , it never came up , ' mr @entity42 said			2
together : both @entity7 and his partner were athletes at the @entity62 he suggested a possible generational split over how much it matters			1
' when i got home last night and saw the attention ( it was receiving ) , it kind of threw me , ' he said			0
' we 're a young production crew and quite honestly it was just another moment in the years we 've done this			0
' in the truck , we were only saying , " wow , this is great emotion here			0
' no one stepped up and said , ' oh , wow , do we really want to be showing this ? ' " the same holds true for the @entity76 , which had an agreement to show the video taken by @entity6 at the @entity39 home of @entity7 's agent and first aired by @entity81 - owned @entity6			1
' we had no discussion on the @entity76 side about how or how much or how little we would show , if or when @entity7 was selected , ' said @entity84 , @entity76 senior coordinating producer			2
' we were certainly not blind or deaf to the cultural significance , ' but draft day can be similarly life - changing for all the players and those close to them , he said			0
' we try to tap into that with all these kids			0
' timing amplified and extended the story 's play on both networks , since it came near the draft 's conclusion and the networks could stick with @entity7 instead of quickly moving on to another pick			2
if the display of affection had been edited by @entity6 , @entity42 said , it would have been inconsistent with more than three decades of draft - day coverage that includes a long string of players kissing their girlfriends			2
happy man : @entity7 announced that he was gay months before the draft , but now that he has been selected , he will be the first openly gay member of the @entity2 context : though gay marriage and homosexual kisses have become more commonplace in certain entertainment shows , some argue that the hyper - masculine world of football is not ready for the shift ' we 're there to document the moment , not make a political statement , ' he said			1
@entity120 president and ceo @entity121 said she was thrilled that @entity6 and the @entity76 carried the couple 's display of affection			1
' as media and corporations continue to embrace and support @entity129 people , it 's almost second nature that there is n't a mechanism to think twice about , " could that be controversial , is that overstepping ? " ' @entity133 said			0
the growth of gay marriage and news coverage of ceremony - sealing kisses by gay and lesbian couples has become increasingly commonplace			0
the quick pecks between @entity7 and @entity10 — they even shared cake , wedding style — were similar , but different			1
context is everything , and the context is the hyper - manly sport of football , where muscles and toughness reign and , until @entity7 , the only sexuality openly displayed was hetero			1
' the definition of masculinity shifted today , whether consciously or not , because during the hyper - masculine @entity2 draft , a man kissed another man on national television			2
the @entity2 and the media are expanding everyone 's consciousness , ' said @entity161 , a former @entity2 player who is the executive director of @entity162 , an advocacy group aimed at getting homophobia out of sports			1
landmark moment : @entity7 and his boyfriend @entity10 partied saturday night away in @entity167 after the draft to write off negative reaction as bigotry is to oversimplify it , @entity161 said			1
' people are used to seeing two people being intimate during the @entity2 draft			2
just not these two people , ' said @entity161 , who is gay			0
' it 's not necessarily people being homophobic			0
i think people push back naturally because it 's so much out of the norm			0
' @entity7 's embrace of @entity10 was instinctive , not a plotted - out statement , said @entity183 , the vice chairman of @entity184 and public relations expert has been working with @entity7			1
' once you make that leap as a gay person ( to come out ) , you want to live your life openly and freely and not use a filter of what 's appropriate according to social norms , ' @entity183 said saturday			2
' if today is about anything , it 's about being able to do that and being authentic			0
' @entity196 : the highly decorated @entity7 disappointed at the scouting combine , causing his draft stock to plummet reaction to the video was mostly positive , @entity84 said , although he acknowledged that the expression of gay affection is at odds with some people 's beliefs			2
some online postings deplored the kiss as inappropriate for family viewing ; others were even harsher in their distaste			0
but it 's inevitable , @entity84 said , that for football and sports in general ' it 's an image that will last			0
' @entity7 , who was not certain to be drafted and was taken with the 249th overall pick out of 256 , still has to prove himself to make the team , but he 's already helping to make a difference off the field			1
when @entity42 's wife explained to their 7 - year - old son that dad was busy working on something that was controversial , @entity7 's kiss on tv , the boy replied : ' is it because they 're not married ? '			1
