@entity0 need their plans for a new stadium to be approved if they wish to keep up with the @entity5 's top sides , according to @entity7 boss @entity6			1
spurs revealed it was ' highly unlikely ' their plans for a proposed 56,000 - seater ground adjacent to @entity12 will be completed ahead of the 2017 - 18 season , following a legal challenge by one of the landowners			1
asked if @entity18 's side needed their new stadium to keep up with the league 's elite teams , @entity6 replied : ' financially , for sure			1
you can not be in a business where you turn down 15,000 or 20,000 people every week			0
if your competitors have more financial power than you , at some stage you have to make a decision			0
construction workers clear space for the new @entity0 stadium despite a legal challenge delaying progress @entity6 believes @entity0 need the money a new stadium would bring in order to keep up ' it looks like everybody makes this decision now , because when you look at @entity41 , @entity42 , [ they ] want to increase their capacity			1
@entity44 go to a bigger stadium next season so if you stay in a smaller capacity , it 's even more difficult			2
' @entity7 went through a similar ordeal 15 years ago , as work on the 60,272 - seater @entity50 was delayed until 2004 , before the @entity51 made the switch from @entity53 two years later			1
' i just think it 's much more difficult today , ' said @entity6 , ' because we built our stadium at a price that you could n't afford it anymore			2
we managed to build our stadium by subsidising it with our own resources			0
that is much more difficult today			0
' @entity7 's improved financial position as a result of their @entity50 move has allowed them to spend big on players like @entity68 international @entity67 , who signed from @entity69 in 2013 for a fee of Â£ 42.5million @entity71 was the @entity51 ' marquee signing this summer , as he joined from @entity74 giants @entity73 ticket sales from @entity7 's 60,272 - seater @entity50 , pictured , have helped them challenge financially the delay to @entity0 's plans means they will need to find a temporary home for one season while the stadium is built			1
a number of venues have been mooted - including stadium : mk in @entity86			0
one option that has been emphatically ruled out is the @entity89 vice-chairman @entity88 has said @entity0 would be barking up the wrong tree if they asked for permission to share the ground , which the @entity44 are due to move into in 2016			2
@entity88 ( centre ) admits it is unlikely @entity0 would be allowed to share the @entity97			0

@entity0 's plans to build a 56,000 - seater ground next to @entity100 have been hit by a legal delay after a challenge by a local landowner
@entity6 said @entity0 need the ground to be built if they wish to stay on a level playing field with the best sides in the @entity5
@entity0 say it is ' highly unlikely ' the new stadium will be built in time for 2017/18 , meaning they will need to share a ground for a season
@entity7 experienced similar delays before moving to the @entity50 in 2006
