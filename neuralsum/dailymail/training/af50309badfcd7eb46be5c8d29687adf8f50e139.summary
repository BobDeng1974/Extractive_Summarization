a college dropout has been hailed a unique maths genius - after his brain was damaged in a brutal attack by muggers			1
@entity6 , 41 , was left concussed after he was ambushed outside a karaoke club and repeatedly kicked in the head			1
now , wherever he looks , he sees mathematical formulas and turns them into stunning , intricate diagrams he can draw by hand			1
he is the only person in the world known to have the skill and experts say it was caused by his head injury			1
incredible : mr @entity6 can produce a visual representation of the formula pi , the infinite number which begins with 3.14 beautiful mind : @entity6 sees mathematical formulas and turns them into stunning , intricate diagrams he can draw by hand they believe the damage to mr @entity6 's brain has left him with a ' remarkable gift ' for figures , much like the brilliant mathematician @entity28			1
mr @entity6 , who works behind the counter at a furniture store in @entity31 , in the @entity33 state of @entity34 , told @entity35 : ' i ’m obsessed with numbers , geometry specifically			1
' i literally dream about it			0
there ’s not a moment that i ca n’t see it , and it just does n’t turn off			0
' mr @entity6 does not have a phd , a degree or even a background in maths			2
instead , his talent was born out of a true medical mystery that scientists around the world are still trying to unravel			0
ten years ago , mr @entity6 was only interested in two things : working out and partying			2
one night he was walking out of a karaoke club in @entity31 when he was set upon by muggers who beat and kicked him in the head repeatedly			2
the unlikely genius thought he was going to be killed as his attackers went for his $ 99 leather jacket			0
' all i saw was a bright flash of light and the next thing i knew i was on my knees on the ground and i thought , " i ’m gon na get killed " , ' he said			0
at the time , doctors said he had a concussion , but within a day or two , mr @entity6 began to notice something remarkable			2
complicated : mr @entity6 draws complex diagrams called fractals , comprising hundreds of shapes which are the same or similar to the whole picture a college dropout who could not draw became obsessed with producing intricate diagrams , but he had no idea what they were			1
' i see bits and pieces of the pythagorean theorem everywhere , ' he said			0
' every single little curve , every single spiral , every tree is part of that equation			0
' striking : mr @entity6 became obsessed with drawing diagrams , but had no idea why mr @entity6 draws diagrams called fractals			1
he can produce a visual representation of the formula pi , the infinite number which begins with 3.14			0
he said : ' a fractal is a shape that when you take the shape a part into pieces , the pieces are the same or similar to the whole			0
' so say i had 1,000 pictures of you , that were little and i put all those little pictures of you in the right spot to make the exact same picture of you , but bigger			0
' much like @entity28 , who was played by @entity110 in the 2001 film , @entity111 , researchers believe mr @entity6 has a remarkable gift			1
detailed : mr @entity6 's drawing of a hand is based on a complex mathematical formula to better understand how his brain works , neuroscientist and philosophy professor @entity116 and her team flew mr @entity6 to @entity120 to run a series of tests			1
a scan showed damage that was forcing his brain to overcompensate in certain areas that most people do not have access to			2
prof @entity116 , who is based at the @entity128 at the @entity129 , said the result that mr @entity6 is now an acquired savant , meaning brilliant in a specific area			2
circles of life : mr @entity6 hopes to teach others that maths is as beautiful and natural as the world around them ' savant syndrome is the development of a particular skill , that can be mathematical , spatial , or autistic , that develop to an extreme degree that sort of makes a person superhuman , ' the professor added			1
mr @entity6 said his goal was to get out of the furniture store and into the classroom to hopefully teach others that maths is as beautiful and natural as the world around us			1
genius : researchers believe mr @entity6 's brain damage has left him with a ' remarkable gift ' for figures , much like the brilliant mathematician @entity28 , who was played in a @entity159 movie by @entity110 , pictured			1
when asked if he thought his talent was a burden or a gift , he said it was a mixture of both			0
' sometimes i would really like to turn it off , and it wo n’t , ' he said			0
' but the good far outweighs the bad			0
i would not give it up for anything			0
' mr @entity6 sells his pictures , which can also be viewed here .			2

furniture store worker @entity6 suffered brain damage in assault by muggers
head injury made him ' obsessed ' with mathematical formulas and turning them into stunning diagrams
researchers compare him to maths genius @entity28
