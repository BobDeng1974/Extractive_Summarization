by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter by far the most captivating character in the far - flung saga of @entity6 state senator turned accused arms trafficker @entity7 is the flashy suit wearing , mustachioed ' reformed ' @entity10 crime boss @entity9			1
the beloved @entity7 's arrest shocked residents throughout a community that largely adored him wednesday , but the flashy suit and mustache @entity14 's was simply another twist in his life 's tale of ruthless crime and redemption			1
but just how much of a twist remains a source of debate			0
while the @entity27 's exhaustive report on his crimes call @entity9 the @entity31 leader of a fearsome triad , local authorities think his days of power have long ago devolved to a life of petty crime			1
they say @entity9 's gang lured state sen. @entity7 into its clutches through money and campaign contributions in exchange for legislative help , as @entity7 sought to rebuild his campaign coffers to run for @entity6 secretary of state			1
checkered history : @entity9 has been in and out of prison since arriving to @entity6 from @entity51 in 1976			2
he was by most accounts a brutal enforcer for a fearsome @entity10 - based triad			2
but the 54 - year - old has claimed to have gone legit since serving out his last stint in 2003 born in @entity51 in 1960 , @entity9 came to the @entity68 at 16 and was reportedly nicknamed ' shrimp boy ' by his grandmother , in part due to his small stature			1
after dropping out of high school , @entity9 rose within the ranks of the local @entity76 gang and became the hired muscle who shook down illegal gambling parlors in the narrow alleyways of the nation 's oldest @entity81			2
his star rose even higher after he and his crew survived an infamous 1977 shooting at a @entity81 restaurant that left five dead and about a dozen people injured			0
@entity9 then spent a few years inside @entity88 for a robbery conviction , and after his release , he started working with the @entity51 - based @entity92 triad , one of numerous @entity43 underground societies linked to organized crime			1
@entity9 has admitted that as a gang leader , he ran prostitution rings , smuggled drugs and extorted thousands of dollars from business owners in the 1980s			0
' he was given like an unofficial position of being a leader , but to say he was sophisticated , no. he was more like a forceful brute , ' said @entity103 , a former @entity104 of justice agent who spent years investigating @entity9 in the early 1990s			0
' if he did n't get his way , he would just beat the door down and that was how we put cases on him			0
' @entity112 figures : the 5 - foot - 5 and forever smiling @entity9 is seen her with then - mayor @entity114			2
he began appearing at events for at risk youth where he urged them , sometimes to the applause of figures like sen. @entity121 , to stay away from gang life crime boss ? the @entity27 says their investigation revealed @entity9 was the revered @entity125 of an international crime syndicate the entire time he was touting his own story of redemption although he ultimately was convicted of gun charges and sentenced to 25 years to life in the 1990s , @entity9 cut a deal to win release and returned @entity81 several years ago , pledging to stay straight			1
his work with at - risk youth soon won accolades from prominent politicians including former city mayor @entity114 and @entity68 senator @entity121			1
that 's when @entity9 's own political star had begun rising			2
around 2008 , he began meeting with at - risk youth to talk with kids about how to stay on the straight and narrow said @entity142 , executive director of the youth - led violence prevention organization @entity144			1
' he was n't just the average guy on the street corner when he had that life , he was somebody you would n't mess with			0
and he 's little so people were like , " damn , that little guy had that much power ? " ' said @entity142 , who said @entity9 's redemption story helped change hundreds of young lives for the good			2
in 2009 , @entity9 summed up his journey toward redemption in a press conference at @entity159			0
' all the criminal past i had , i can not deny that , ' he said through his ever - present grin			0
' but today i do not represent crime			0
i do not represent violence and gangs			0
' the many faces of shrimp boy : while authorities never believed he 'd cleaned up his act , @entity6 investigators are slow to believe the @entity27 's blanket assertion that @entity9 was a full fledged @entity81 crime boss ' he was given like an unofficial position of being a leader , but to say he was sophisticated , no. he was more like a forceful brute , ' said @entity103 , a former @entity177 agent who spent years investigating @entity9 in the early 1990s			1
' if he did n't get his way , he would just beat the door down and that was how we put cases on him			0
' while the local authorities never believed claims @entity9 had cleaned himself up , @entity103 told the @entity185 that his other claims -- of his vaunted status within his international crime operation -- were no more based in reality			1
' the local gangsters have a saying : ' follow the shrimp if you do n't want to eat , ' @entity103 told the @entity185			0
