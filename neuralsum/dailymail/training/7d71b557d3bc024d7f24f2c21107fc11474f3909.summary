by @entity0 published : 08:11 est , 11 december 2012 updated : 10:57 est , 11 december 2012 a woman slumps in her chair in a darkened hall in the aftermath of a party , the very picture of the loneliness and isolation some people feel after the last song is played and the celebrations are over			0
the picture is one of a series of miserable and disturbing - but often oddly amusing - images created by a pair of @entity18 artists who use cardboard boxes to build scenes showing the bleak side of the human experience			1
@entity24 photographers @entity25 , 28 , and @entity26 , 30 , use 20 boxes per scene to painstakingly produce the disquieting scenes in a bid to showcase their talents and break into the advertising industry			1
lonely : a glum girl in a party dress sits by herself in the aftermath of a party			0
the scene was created by two @entity18 artists using cardboard and models in another a rifle - wielding child in his pyjamas coldly peers down at the bloodied body of the home invader he has just gunned down by the chimney - jolly old @entity44			1
they say the realistic scenes , which include a woman nonchalantly smoking while surveying a car that has ploughed through her kitchen wall , are intended to strike a balance between tragedy and humour			1
each bizarre scene takes between two and four days to create			1
' when people first see these images there is an element of surprise , ' said @entity25			1
definitely on the naughty list : @entity60 is taken out by a young boy mistaking him for a burglar			0
@entity63 : a woman smoking a cigarette watches a @entity66 that has smashed the walls of her cardboard kitchen ' they usually do n't spot the cardboard at first			2
' we needed to show the skills you have to master to produce advertising photography			0
' these include creating complex lightning and being able to make realistic photomontages			2
' darkness : a girl shines a torch on a mysterious pile of rickety dollhouse furniture in this scene light : a semi-naked man watches his clothes burn in his cardboard flat , which also begins to smoulder in the blaze he added : ' so we first came up with making scenes in realistic miniatures houses with doll house furniture but it was too realistic so we decided to break it with a very common and recognisable material - cardboard			1
' it 's fun to see that even now , people do n't notice at first that these scenes take place in a miniature setting			2
' @entity25 explained how he was able to create these extraordinary scenes using dollhouse miniatures bought from a nearby model shop			1
dark : this strange tableau of an older and younger man is both uncomfortable and saddening a woman in her tattered living room gazes blankly into space			0
each scene takes between two and four days narrative : a pregnant woman and her baby outside a ramshackle cardboard house			2
@entity25 says he wants people to create their own stories to go with each scene darkness and light : a child stands in the street in a corrugated cityscape in this macabre image he said : ' there is no hidden message			0
we want to make people to make their own stories for each image			0
' it may be a bit depressing but i hope we are somewhere between tragedy and humour			0

*startlingly* *lifelike* images made using cardboard boxes
@entity18 artists create darkly comical scenes
they used cardboard as early attempts with dollhouses were ' too realistic '
