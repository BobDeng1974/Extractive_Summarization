by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 has firm belief that @entity4 can again turn him into a grand prix winner - just not this year			1
@entity2 's return to @entity7 this season has been a bitter disappointment as it was firmly expected he would provide team - mate @entity10 with a run for his money			1
but the change in the regulations and the introduction of the new power unit has left @entity4 trailing , and @entity2 with a car that for the most part he has not enjoyed driving			1
improvements : @entity2 recorded a season best sixth for @entity4 in @entity23 last time out still got it : @entity2 claims he still has the speed and can win races with @entity4 in the future of the 142 points @entity4 have accrued in the championship to date , @entity2 has collected just 27 of them			1
eight of those came from his best result of sixth in the last race in @entity23 at the end of last month prior to the current summer break			2
to boot , it was from one of his worst grid positions of 16th due to a qualifying gaffe by the team that cost him a place in the second session			0
@entity2 , the 2007 world champion with @entity4 , knows much still needs to be altered with the car and within the team before his situation changes drastically for the better			1
' it 's been a hard first part of the year , ' said @entity2			2
' i know i 've not lost speed from last year , so it 's been disappointing to fight against the issues and problems we 've had			0
' i hope the second part of the season will be much better than the first , but one slightly better day does n't change an awful lot			0
in the shade : despite finishing sixth , @entity2 still trailed team - mate @entity10 ( left ) in @entity23 who came home in second behind race winner @entity63 ( centre ) and ahead of @entity65 ( right ) better times : @entity2 rejoined @entity4 this season having last raced for them in 2009			1
the @entity67 won the world championship while with the @entity7 outfit two years earlier ' it does n't take away the mistakes , the things we have to improve , to make us work much better as a team			1
' there are a lot of things that need to be done to make sure we are where we should be			0
' yet @entity2 firmly believes the team are on the right track , even if progress is slow , which is why he has one eye on next year , not just the final eight races of this season to come			1
' i believe in people and the team , that we can put ourselves where we should be , and there are some signs , ' added @entity2			2
' they 've been putting people in the right areas , and i 'm sure in the future it will pay off big time			0
' we know where we are , what we have to do , but there 's a long way to go to be where we want to be , as a team , as @entity4			2
' we have to make big steps for next year , to keep improving things , and i know we have good plans			0
' we just have to go step by step to improve the issues we have and hopefully we can put things in the right order for me to be happy all the time with the car			0
' that will then allow the team and myself to progress to where i feel we should be and to try to win races			0
