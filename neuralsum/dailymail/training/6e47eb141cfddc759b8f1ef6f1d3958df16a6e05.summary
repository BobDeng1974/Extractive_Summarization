the wife of @entity2 president @entity1 has caused outrage after posting happy snaps of her charity work on @entity6			1
@entity8 - born @entity7 is seen preparing and serving food to refugees alongside mobile kitchen volunteers			1
in what appeared to be a bid to win back favour across the clone , @entity1 opened the @entity6 account in july , but it did not take long before it backfired			0
backfire : @entity2 first - lady @entity7 posted pictures of herself volunteering at a mobile kitchen , serving refugees which were not kindly received eyes closed : @entity7 's @entity6 posts have been seen as an act of ignorance of the sufferings of the @entity2 people the @entity2 president waves to crowds in pictures posted to @entity6 , despite the horrific war sweeping the country although some users comment on @entity36 's ' beautiful soul ' a majority of the comments are less forgiving			1
' i love ur designer clothes and shoes ... paid for by the blood of your people ! seriously , u make @entity44 look like an angel compared to you ! , ' wrote one @entity6 user			0
others comment on the ' hypocrisy ' of @entity36 being pictured caring for young people when tens of thousands of children have died in the two - year @entity2 war			2
to this date , more than 100,000 people are believed to have been killed in the conflict since it started in 2011			0
@entity7 posted a series of images of her day preparing the @entity60 meal with volunteers from @entity62 earlier this month supporting her husband : @entity7 and her husband grin broadly at another meet and greet , with grim - faced minders conspicuously in the background she must have a good stylist : the always impeccably - coiffed @entity7 shakes hands with a @entity2 woman at a university graduation ceremony but as millions have fled the fighting to neighbouring states , the @entity2 regime appear to have stepped up their attempts to show a life - as - normal image for the president			1
in his @entity6 account - where pictures were first posed on july 24 - the leader can be seen smiling , doing paperwork , meeting children and waving to cheering crowds			1
@entity86 , deputy director for @entity87 in the @entity88 and @entity89 , said @entity91 's @entity6 account was something different to previous leaders like the deposed @entity95 president @entity94 and @entity97 dictator @entity96			0
he said : ' i think it is a generational thing , i am not aware older leaders like @entity94 and @entity96 used social networking , but the @entity2 regime has always been keen to show a business - like image to the world			1
' i am not surprised by this account , but it is a parallel between the regime attempting to want to show a sense of normality and the reality for the people subjected to the bombs , arbitrary arrests , human rights abuses and violence			2
' @entity1 is not going to show the millions of people displaced , it 's not going to show attacks on civilians			2
' an @entity120 campaigner said : ' no amount of photos or tweets or @entity125 posts will ever wash away the stain on the @entity2 government 's record ' hospital visit : a concerned - looking mrs @entity7 talks with a woman presumably injured in the fighting which has rocked @entity133 for more than two years as another patient looks on cynicism : @entity6 users stated their incredulity at the pictures @entity133 campaign manager , @entity139 , said : ' on one level you 'd have to say that it 's not surprising to find any government , even the rigid and oppressive one in @entity144 , using social media to broadcast and frame its own narrow world view			1
' image obviously matters in a cult of personality and the illusion of relative stability is important in president @entity1 's " love me or i 'll kill you " strategy			0
' naturally , we 'll find no trace here of the horrifying reality on the ground in @entity133 - of the torture chambers or places of execution			0
seeing the @entity163 in hospitals only reminds you of the fact that @entity2 government hospitals have been used as places of torture			0
' no amount of photos or tweets or @entity125 posts will ever wash away the stain on the @entity2 government 's record			0
' i 'm on your level ... mrs @entity7 meets schoolgirls with their teacher in what appears to be a school gym be prepared : mrs @entity7 meets children from what appears to be the @entity2 version of the scouts it 's what all the cool kids are using ... the @entity6 home page of the @entity2 presidency			2
