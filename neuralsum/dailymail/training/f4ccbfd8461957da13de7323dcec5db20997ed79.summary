@entity10 telephoned his deputy @entity11 during the hit show on saturday evening and they agreed that @entity14 should get double what he was entitled to if he did the ' honourable ' thing and quit			1
after the £ 1.3m deal was done , which also included a £ 877,000 pension pot , ms @entity11 went back to watching dancers like @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , the @entity8 confirmed to @entity27			2
@entity4 's pay deal has caused huge controversy and the admission the offer was sealed in this way could cause more damage to the @entity8			1
' @entity34 was consulted on saturday evening as a member of the @entity36			0
during the broadcast of @entity9 she took a call from the chairman for this and then returned to watching television afterwards , ' a @entity8 spokesperson said			1
' there was not a formal meeting of the @entity36 but each member of the @entity36 was consulted			0
' ms @entity11 is married to @entity8 technology correspondent @entity46 and was economics editor for @entity48 for eight years			2
meanwhile the @entity8 was locked in an extraordinary standoff with @entity50 and @entity51 last night over the ‘ unacceptable ’ £ 450,000 double pay - off to the former director general			1
mps on all sides voiced outrage over a ‘ reward for failure ’ as it emerged mr @entity4 had been paid double the cash he was entitled to in order to ‘ conclude matters quickly ’			1
@entity63 ’s deputy leader @entity62 urged mr @entity4 to give up half his pay - off – £ 225,000 – saying it was impossible to justify			1
deal : @entity8 vice chairman @entity11 was called by her boss @entity10 during @entity9 - they agreed on @entity4 's deal and then she went back to watching the show strictly business : @entity23 stunned the judges with her routine on saturday - an episode watched by @entity11 as she helped agree @entity4 's pay deal strictly one payoff : @entity34 , @entity10 's deputy , sent this @entity78 picture as she prepared to watch reality show @entity9 and sign off former director general @entity4 's £ 450,000 pay off deputy prime minister @entity81 also said it was difficult to justify , saying today : ' mr @entity4 was offered this money , he did not need to take it			1
' he told @entity86 's @entity85 that it was ' up to the @entity8 to justify , as @entity10 sought to , why they took the decision '			2
mr @entity4 resigned on saturday night , saying he was doing the ‘ honourable ’ thing by taking responsibility for @entity92 ’s disastrous investigation into child abuse			2
@entity95 chief executive @entity94 is said to be the early favourite to replace @entity4 as the next director general			1
@entity94 joined the @entity8 as a trainee after graduating from @entity99 and helped launch @entity50 , @entity100 and by 34 was editing the 9 o'clock news			2
he then went on to hold several senior executive roles before going to the @entity95 in 2001 - two years after a failed application to be director general			0
he did not apply last time but an insider said he is ' respected inside and outside the @entity8 ' and could be ideal to steady the ship			0
his pay - off came after just 54 days in the job , making it worth more than £ 8,000 for every day he served			1
he also leaves with an £ 877,000 pension pot. but culture secretary @entity112 told mps it was ‘ not right ’ for mr @entity4 to be handed such a massive pay - off and urged him to ‘ consider whether it is appropriate for him to accept those payments ’			1
mrs @entity112 , who invited the @entity119 to investigate the deal said it was a ‘ reward for failure ’ , adding : ‘ the circumstances of his departure make it hard to justify the level of severance money agreed			0
’ ministers say they are powerless to block the payment but hope to shame mr @entity4 into giving up part of it , as they did with the vast pension owed to @entity134 boss @entity133			2
a @entity51 source said the payment was ‘ hard to justify ’ , adding that it was now ‘ a matter for @entity4 ’s conscience ’			0
earlier , the @entity8 chairman @entity10 claimed the decision to hand mr @entity4 a pay - off worth a year ’s salary was necessary to ensure his swift resignation and co-operation with a series of internal inquiries			1
outraged : @entity63 ’s deputy leader @entity62 , left , and culture secretary @entity112 , right , told @entity113 it was unacceptable for disgraced @entity4 to keep all of his £ 450,000 pay - off mr @entity4 ’s contract entitled him to only six months ’ severance pay if he resigned			1
but @entity10 suggested that mr @entity4 would have been sacked if he had refused to quit – in which case he would have been entitled to a 12 - month pay - off			1
@entity10 ’s explanation irritated @entity51 and led to fresh calls in @entity50 for his resignation			0

he refused to be drawn on mr @entity4 ’s pay - off , @entity179 , head of the @entity180 , which helped @entity92 produce the child abuse report , resigned from his post , @entity63 ’s deputy chairman @entity183 was urged to apologise for using parliamentary privilege to make separate claims that a senior @entity169 was involved in child abuse			1
humiliation : @entity4 , flanked by @entity8 chairman @entity187 , announces his resignation to the media over the ' unacceptable ' @entity92 broadcast which wrongly implicated a senior former conservative in a child abuse scandal during an emergency debate in the @entity194 four mps called for @entity10 to go			2
@entity197 , a @entity169 member of the @entity196 said the former @entity169 chairman had been ‘ asleep at the wheel ’			0

she said @entity10 had ‘ a key role in ensuring this crisis is handled successfully ’			0
@entity169 mps @entity212 and @entity214 said the crisis of trust raised questions about the future of the licence fee			0
mr @entity212 said : ‘ this latest debacle will bring forward the day when the @entity222 people will have the freedom to decide for themselves whether to pay for the @entity8			2
’ other mps insisted the crisis must not be used as an excuse to dismantle a much - loved institution			0
@entity228 claimed an @entity230 bias within the @entity8 helped explain the haste with which @entity92 attempted to ‘ smear ’ members of the @entity235 government without proper checks			0
mp @entity237 described the @entity92 investigation as a ‘ vengeful and spiteful ’ attack on @entity235 and her legacy			0
@entity167 called for everyone involved in the broadcast to be sacked immediately			0
