by @entity0 published : 13:19 est , 18 october 2012 updated : 05:04 est , 19 october 2012 a killer was caught on camera stalking his victim minutes after she was refused a lift home by police			1
@entity7 , 24 , was filmed walking a few yards behind @entity8 in the residential street in which she would meet her death			1
six minutes later he is pictured running away after battering the 28 - year - old mother of two to death with a lump of concrete			1
the officers told the jury they advised her to get a taxi , adding : ‘ we are not a taxi service			1
’ she then tried to board an out - of - service bus before heading toward the road in which she was murdered			2
one after the other : ms @entity8 ( left ) was seen quickly passing a @entity18 camera , soon followed by @entity7 ( right ) spotted again : later , @entity7 ( top left ) was seen on the same camera running back in the opposite direction her body was found in an alleyway the next morning			1
miss @entity8 is believed to have been killed there after refusing @entity7 ’s demands for sex			1
speaking outside court , ms @entity8 's stepfather @entity51 said the family held @entity54 responsible for putting her in the path of her murderer that night			1
he said the police could have used their powers to take ms @entity8 home when she jumped into their car , as she was clearly intoxicated and in need of assistance			1
‘ instead they were dismissive of her and , in the words of the defence barrister mr @entity65 , she was treated as an inconvenience , ’ mr @entity51 said			0
‘ the two officers simply pointed her in the direction of home and watched her stagger off for a few seconds until she disappeared from view			2
‘ it is the family 's opinion that @entity8 was failed by @entity54 that night ( who had ) the chance to ensure a vulnerable young woman , worse the wear for drink , was taken to a place for safety			1
' so the police , in our opinion , failed @entity8 and their advice to take a taxi put her right in the path of her murderer			1
’ mr @entity51 added that a bus driver and a colleague , who drove past ms @entity8 and swerved out of her way when she stepped into the road and tried to flag the vehicle down , were also accountable			2
‘ the bus was not in regular service , ’ he said			0
‘ it was effectively a taxi for other bus drivers finishing their shifts and did not come off duty until 5am that day			0
’ he added : ‘ i was always led to believe that bus drivers would give free passage to children and vulnerable adults if it was needed			0
@entity8 flagged them down and was asking for help and was ignored			2
‘ the bus driver who was a passenger on that bus reported during the trial they get drunk people a lot flagging them down and it was normal			0
‘ so too it seems was their callousness and disregard for public safety whilst at the same time expecting their custom			0
’ a second camera had earlier captured @entity7 watching miss @entity8 wandering apparently the worse for drink after a family gathering			1
yesterday he was jailed for life with a minimum term of 20 years after being found guilty of murdering @entity121 and sexually assaulting another woman he dragged off the street a month later			0
the man who found miss @entity8 ’s body was awoken by her cries of ‘ get off me ’ but went back to bed when he failed to find anyone outside			2
a post-mortem examination found she died of head injuries			0
at the time of the attack – in july 2011 – she was living in @entity133 , @entity25 , with her partner and sons , aged seven and one			1
the court heard that @entity7 ’s second victim was also walking home after a night out in @entity25 when he grabbed her by the throat and dragged her into the grounds of a college where he assaulted her			1
she persuaded @entity7 not to harm her further and was able to recall enough of the encounter to help police identify him			2
the 22 - year - old said yesterday that she believes she survived the attack by remaining calm and trying ‘ to convince him i liked him ’ – promising that she would meet him again on another day			2
@entity7 was found guilty of false imprisonment , false imprisonment with intent to commit a sexual offence and sexual assault in relation to that attack and was handed a concurrent four - year jail term			1
passing sentence , mr @entity157 said @entity7 had ‘ effectively stalked ’ miss @entity8 , putting on gloves and a hood before following her down a garden pathway			1
he added : ‘ only you know what happened in that dark alleyway , but it is clear you cornered and attacked her			0
you subjected @entity8 to a savage attack , bludgeoning her over her head , causing injuries from which she would die alone and defenceless			2
’ after the verdict , detective chief inspector @entity170 of @entity54 said many officers were asked for lifts home and the two in this case had acted in accordance with protocol			1
the victim ’s mother , @entity179 , said her grandchildren could not understand ‘ why their mummy is n’t around ’			0
plea for help : ms @entity8 was seen on a bus cctv camera trying to wave it down just minutes before she died assistance plea : the driver of the out - of - service bus was taking staff members home when he spotted her dangerous : the driver claimed he was forced to brake and swerve to prevent the bus from hitting ms @entity8 @entity8 's mother @entity179 said : ' @entity8 ( right ) was a beautiful little girl , who grew into a strong - willed and determined young woman			1
she lived for her two sons , and played a big part in our family life			0
' her murder has devastated everyone and it has been so difficult for us all , and especially her boys to understand why their mummy is n’t around			0
' @entity204 , who is now nine , keeps asking questions about what happened and who did this			0
while it does n’t change the fact she ca n’t see them grow up , it will be slightly easier now to explain to him that the person who did this has been sent to prison			0
' @entity8 had an extremely loving nature			0
she is missed every day and somehow we have to find a way of living without her			0
' i would also like to thank my family and friends for their support , the prosecution , dci @entity170 , @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 from victim support			0
' video : ms @entity8 seen on a bus cctv camera trying to wave it down			0
