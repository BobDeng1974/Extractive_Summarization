by @entity1 expert dr @entity0 dr @entity0 busts the myths about what makes a contented newborn the first four months of a baby ’s life can be a testing time for parents and caregivers			1
the wide range of confusing , and sometimes conflicting advice available can create even more anxiety at an already stressful time			1
@entity13 and infant health expert dr @entity0 cuts through the confusion in her new book @entity16			1
the mother - of - two has busted the top six myths about caring for newborns			1
babies need to be taught how to sleep babies do n’t need to be taught how to sleep – sleep is a normal biological process , which ca n’t be forced			1
it is not under conscious control			0
sleep is actually controlled by two biological sleep regulators and our job is to remove obstacles that are often put in the way of healthy sleep			2
parents may be told that if they do n’t teach their baby to sleep now , that child will become a poor sleeper later in childhood , with negative effects on learning and development			1
but this is simply not true , if you look at the latest evidence			0
dr @entity45 believes that babies do n’t need to be taught how to sleep – sleep is a normal biological process which ca n’t be forced myth 2			1
feed / play / sleep cycles are the best way to get your baby into a good sleep routine sleepiness at the end of a feed is caused by the hormones of satiety and relaxation , and is a sign that the normal biological sleep regulators are kicking in			2
sleepiness at the end of feeds is a powerful biological cue ; by deliberately ignoring this cue and not letting your baby fall asleep at the end of a feed , which is often what parents are told to do , we interfere with the healthy function of the sleep regulators			1
the sleep may not last for long but catnapping during the day is quite normal for babies			2
dr @entity45 ( pictured with her baby ) says sleepiness at the end of feeds is a powerful biological cue myth 3			1
back - arching , breast refusal and vomiting are signs of gastro - oesphageal reflux disease ( @entity83 ) in this age group back - arching at the breast , pulling off of the breast or refusing to feed actually signal a feeding problem , one that can be helped by a health professional who is trained in clinical breastfeeding support			2
vomiting ( once medical conditions like pyloric stenosis have been ruled out ) is normal and peaks at about four months			0
dr @entity45 says back - arching or pulling off of the breast , or refusing to feed , can actually signal a feeding problem myth 4			1
burping helps settle babies burping is a practice that spread around the world with the @entity101 , but is unnecessary			0
babies relieve themselves of any wind naturally from any position , just like you and me			0
if it seems to be working for you , that ’s fine – but if your baby is unsettled , i usually recommend not burping , because it disrupts that lovely sleepiness at the end of the feed which allows the baby ’s biological sleep regulators to kick in			0
dr @entity45 does n't recommend burping , because it disrupts the sleepiness at the end of the feed which allows the baby ’s biological sleep regulators to kick in myth 5			1
babies need a quiet , dark sleep environment free of stimulus many families are told that their baby is unsettled because of over-stimulation , but this is not true			2
this false belief can be traced back directly to the concern doctors felt at the beginning of the 20th century about the effects of electric lighting , motor transport and radio on children ’s developing brains , and has persisted despite lack of evidence			0
in fact , all the new neuroscience research suggests that under - stimulation of the senses from long periods spent in quiet , dark rooms during the day represents the greater risk			0
research suggests under - stimulation of the senses from long periods spent in quiet , dark rooms during the day represents the greater risk myth 6			0
sleep breeds sleep this adage is a misinterpretation of the fact that a baby who is relaxed and content falls asleep easily ; that is , calm breeds calm			0
but sleep ca n’t be forced , and babies ’ sleep needs are incredibly varied			2
your baby might need half as much sleep as the baby next door in the same 24 - hour period , and both babies are normal			2
removing the obstacles to sleep – like long naps during the day in artificially dark and quiet rooms , or following a feed / play / sleep routine – will help your baby ’s natural sleep regulators do their job			0
