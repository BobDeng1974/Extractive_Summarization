they roared their team on in expectation of the win			0
the @entity4 is rarely a placed for fiery passions but the home fans make an exception here for north @entity10 derbies			2
and those @entity12 fans knew the victory should be theirs			1
@entity12 had largely dominated against their neighbours			1
they had by far the best of the attacking play			2
they had a sprinkling of delightful offensive options in @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , a trio that would grace almost any team in the world			0
only @entity30 and @entity31 , giants in the @entity29 defence , stood between them and three points			1
surely those points would come ? surely such an array of talent should be enough to overpower teams such as @entity29 ? @entity12 forward @entity38 ( left ) scores the equaliser against @entity29 @entity12 's @entity38 celebrates scoring the equaliser against @entity29 at the @entity4 @entity12 : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 ( @entity47 28 ) , @entity38 , @entity48 ( @entity22 45 ) , @entity49 ( @entity20 63 ) , @entity21 , @entity50			1

and yet it was not to be			0
@entity12 ’s infamous brittleness had cost them again			1
games they should win , they draw ; games in which they ought to be competitive , they end up being comprehensively beaten			0
it is almost pointless to single out the individuals — last night it was @entity47 , losing the ball in front of his own penalty area — as almost all the team are serial offenders			1
spurs will be grateful for their draw			0
but until @entity93 can address the vulnerabilities he has in shielding his defence — and he shows no sign of wishing to do so — there will be many more @entity97 like this			0
there was much speculation as to whether @entity21 would feature in his favoured central role — or be shunted out to the left			0
as it was , he started out wide , but swapped the position regularly with @entity49 , the two of them undertaking the wide left duties as though it were an undesirable job - share			2
and this derby felt a very @entity110 affair early on			0
certainly the tackling was of a certain vintage			0
@entity38 and @entity49 received yellow cards , all too keen to make their impression — literally — on @entity29 , before @entity63 added his own @entity117 mark , cautioned for a late challenge on @entity45			1
and the football was of variable quality in that first half			2
what there was , was mainly created by @entity12			2
@entity50 was the first to inject some class into the game with a lovely flick past @entity128 and , leaving the @entity129 in his wake , he was only denied by the assiduous covering run of @entity30			0
@entity50 shot unconvincingly at @entity31 on 22 minutes but it was n’t until 28 minutes that @entity12 conjured another clear chance			1
@entity48 raced down the right and released @entity50 , who touched the ball back to @entity49 , who in turn struck the ball ferociously from the edge of the box with @entity31 well positioned to save			1
@entity49 attacked @entity29 ’s penalty area on 32 minutes , eventually falling under a challenge from @entity142 and apparently twisting his ankle badly			1
whether he was tripped or stumbled was a moot point , but referee @entity75 opted for the latter interpretation			0
@entity29 midfielder @entity146 scores the opening goal against @entity12 on saturday @entity29 celebrate @entity146 opening the scoring against @entity12 at the @entity4 @entity149 miles @entity12 110.9 68.9 @entity21 90 11.0 6.8 @entity150 90 10.5 6.5 @entity45 90 10.4 6.5 @entity29 115.3 71.7 @entity63 90 11.9 7.4 @entity61 90 11.6 7.2 @entity62 90 11.4 7.1 yet @entity12 remain a delight for positive - minded opponents			1
if @entity29 had more confidence or incision in their attacking positions they would surely have made more of the wide spaces in around @entity12 ’s defensive line			1
time after time players mis - controlled , stumbled over the ball or lost possession			0
typical of their first half was the opening for @entity68 on 38 minutes			2
set up nicely by @entity63 , he simply prodded the ball too far in front of him			0
similarly , from a tight angle but with a clear sight of goal , @entity146 pulled his shot lamely wide on 45 minutes			1
shortly before that @entity169 chance , @entity12 created the best move of the match , @entity48 executing a lovely dummy before feeding @entity38 , whose strike from outside the box tested @entity31 to the full on 44 minutes			1
sadly it was @entity48 ’s last significant contribution , the @entity178 limping off before half - time , joining @entity46 , who had been withdrawn injured on 30 minutes			1
@entity61 was doing his utmost on his @entity182 debut , having impressed against @entity183 in the @entity184 in midweek			0
but though he pressed forward , troubled @entity12 with driving runs on occasion , it was a big ask to pit against one of the finest midfields			2
both he and @entity146 were struggling to impose themselves			2
and @entity12 started the second half with similar attacking intent to the first			1
substitute @entity22 ghosted past his man and forced @entity30 to divert his cross-shot for a corner			0
then @entity49 found @entity21 , with the @entity196 forcing a good save from @entity31 from 12 yards			2
yet @entity12 ’s fragility when in possession is almost the defining feature of their football in the later @entity93 years			2
so it would prove again			0
@entity47 was caught by @entity64 on the ball just outside his own area on 56 minutes			1
the @entity204 found @entity63 , who played in @entity169			0
with @entity41 to beat , the @entity129 did n’t disappoint , pulling the ball confidently past the keeper before turning to celebrate directly with a cupped ear in front of the @entity12 fans in a glorious breach of the usual etiquette , which earned him a booking			1
@entity12 , stirred , almost responded immediately , @entity43 rising ever upwards to head a free - kick goalwards			2
for a moment it appeared he had scored before @entity31 scrambled the ball away off the line			0
@entity12 , though , had dominated the attacking play and it seemed unlikely they would be denied for 90 minutes			1
so it proved on 75 minutes , when @entity63 scuffed a clearance , which fell to @entity20			0
the @entity221 dragged the ball back to @entity22 but his shot was deflected and the chance seemed to end in calamity , when @entity50 hit an embarrassing air shot just yards from goals			0
but amid the confusion caused , @entity38 was following up and smashed the ball high into the net from six yards			1

@entity251 *captain* @entity46 and @entity48 were both been forced off in the first half with injury
@entity49 turned his ankle when pressing into the @entity29 penalty area , where he looked to be tripped by @entity142 , but after limping off for treatment was able to play on
@entity29 took the lead on 56 minutes when @entity146 raced clear and *slotted* the ball under @entity41
@entity38 smashed home an equaliser for @entity12 in the 74th minute
