but by 4.30pm , she was holding her new baby in her arms			0
and the 25 - year - old @entity10 , who has lived in the @entity12 since 2012 , had no idea she was even pregnant , let alone at 37 weeks			1
surprise : @entity15 , pictured with her newborn baby girl @entity16 , gave birth at 37 weeks , despite not knowing she was pregnant or having any symptoms the former @entity22 resident said despite feeling ' a little bit off ' in the morning , it was not until about 11am that stomach pains grew strong enough to worry her , @entity19 reported			1
by 1pm the pain was so serve , ms @entity4 decided she needed to go home			1
fearing the pain was appendicitis , ms @entity4 eventually called an ambulance and arrived at hospital by 2.30pm			1

' i definitely did n’t think i was pregnant , that was for sure			0

surprise : @entity15 , pictured with her newborn baby girl @entity16 , gave birth at 37 weeks , despite not knowing she was pregnant or having any symptoms when she arrived at the hospital , ms @entity4 was initially told the pain could have been a result of a stomach bug			1
' it was n’t until the midwives were like " no , feel here " , and said i was fully dilated			0
they started telling me to push , and i said " push what ? what are you talking about ? " , ' she said			0

' you just never expect it to happen to you , it ’s one of those things you read in the paper , ' she said			0
obstetrician dr @entity73 , from @entity71 at @entity72 in @entity22 , said while ms @entity4 's unexpected birth was rare , it was not unheard of			1
the doctor added that while @entity16 's weight was normal for a baby , although on the lower end of the normal range , it would have helped conceal the her in the womb			2
in more than 20 years of doing obstetrics , dr @entity73 said he had only seen three or four cases where this type of pregnancy had occurred			0
the doctor said he was aware of a woman in her 40s who attributed a lack of periods to menopause and a woman falling pregnant shortly after giving birth , who believed an absence of periods was due to breast feeding			2
