the giant internal organ reportedly weighed a colossal 6lbs ( 2.7kg ) - and was 20 times bigger thanit should have been			1
it was was extracted from a 45 - year - old suffering from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( @entity13 )			1
this condition causes fluid - filled cysts to grow in the kidneys , so they expand in size			1
surgeons have removed the kidneys , which weighed as much as a newborn baby , from a 45 - year - old man with a genetic disease			1
scan shows the kidneys , which had grown to 20 times their normal size incredibly , a week after his initial operation at @entity29 's @entity28 , a second kidney weighing 5.5lbs ( 2.5kg ) was removed			1

in the early stages , there may be no symptoms and the cysts wo n't be noticed until adulthood			0

two thirds of adults with @entity13 will develop high blood pressure , and 1 in 12 will develop small brain aneurysms			2
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( @entity13 ) is an inherited condition that causes small , fluid - filled sacs called cysts to develop in the kidneys			1
although children are born with the condition , @entity13 does not usually cause any noticeable problems until the cysts grow large enough to affect the kidneys ' functions			1
in most cases , this does n't occur until 30 - 60 years of age			0
when @entity13 reaches this stage , it can cause a wide range of problems , including abdominal pain , high blood pressure , blood in the urine , urine infections and kidney stones			2
eventually , kidney function gets worse and worse , until so much is lost that kidney failure develops			0
