if you always have room for dessert – and maybe even a second helping – you are about to be handed the perfect excuse			0
it may be in your genes			0
scientists say that millions of @entity7 carry a rogue stretch of dna that stops them feeling full and leaves them craving sugary and fatty foods			1
the @entity13 gene , carried by more than half of the population , was discovered several years ago			1
but while researchers knew it made people fat , they did n’t know how it did so			0
scientists have shown that a rogue stretch of dna carried by millions of @entity7 stops them from feeling full after eating			1
the ' hunger gene ' prevents a drop in the hunger hormone ghrelin after eating now they have learned that it keeps people feeling hungry , it could lead to new ways to tackle the obesity crisis			1
the 16 per cent of the population that carries two copies of the rogue dna are 70 per cent more likely to become obese than those without the gene			1
a rogue stretch of dna - the @entity13 gene - carried by millions of @entity7 stops them from feeling full after eating			1
people with this dna particularly crave sugary and fatty foods			1
half of @entity7 carry the gene and they are 30 % more likely to be obese			1
16 % of @entity7 carry two rouge copies of the rogue dna and they are 70 % more likely to be obese			1
they eat up to 200 extra calories a day and are almost half a stone heavier than their average counterparts			0
and for those with the ‘ hunger gene ’ dieting is doomed to failure			2
even those who have inherited just one flawed @entity13 gene – 49 per cent of the population – are 30 per cent more likely to be obese			1
the @entity7 - led research team asked young men with and without the genetic flaw to rate their hunger before and after a meal			2
volunteers ’ blood samples were then tested for ghrelin , a hormone that triggers feelings of hunger			1
levels of ghrelin are usually high before we eat , and fall afterwards			0
but in the men with the ‘ hunger gene ’ , levels remained relatively high after eating			2
they also felt hungrier than the others			0
next , the volunteers were shown pictures of various foods after they had eaten and asked how appealing they seemed			0
and despite just having had a meal , those with the gene still found cakes , pastries , chips and burgers highly tempting			0
the scientists then used mri scanners to peer into the volunteers ’ brains			0
those with the ‘ hunger gene ’ lit up more at the thought of fatty and sugary foods , the @entity90 reports			1
people with the @entity13 gene particularly crave sugary and fatty foods - explaining why some people find dessert irresistible , no matter how much they have already eaten study leader dr @entity101 , of @entity102 , said that some of us were simply ‘ biologically programmed to eat more ’			1
she added : ‘ not only do these people have higher ghrelin levels and therefore feel hungrier , their brains respond differently to ghrelin and to pictures of food			0
it ’s a double hit			0
’ the work , which was funded by the medical research charity the @entity113 and the @entity114 , could speed research into new obesity treatments			0
despite the scale of the obesity crisis , there is only one prescription - strength weight loss drug available in the @entity7			2
but drugs are not the only weapon against the hunger gene			2
dr @entity101 said : ‘ we know that ghrelin , and therefore hunger , can be reduced by exercise like running or cycling or by eating a high - protein diet			2
’ professor @entity131 , an obesity expert from @entity133 , agreed the research would spur on the search for new treatments			0
it could also help in targeting any drugs to those who would benefit the most , he said .			0

a rogue stretch of @entity142 stops millions of @entity7 feeling full after eating
people with the rogue dna - the @entity13 gene - crave sugary and fatty foods
16 % carry 2 rogue copies of the dna and are 70 % more likely to be obese
49 % carry one flawed @entity13 gene and are 30 % more likely to be obese
people with the ' hunger gene ' do not experience a drop in hormone ghrelin after eating as they should - this hormone triggers feelings of hunger
