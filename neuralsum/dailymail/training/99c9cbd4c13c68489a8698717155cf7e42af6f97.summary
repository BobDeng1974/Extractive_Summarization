if you like a strong cup of black coffee , your dentist has probably told you it is doing your teeth no favours			1
but new research suggests that drunk in moderation , coffee can actually stop tooth decay			1
@entity13 scientists have found that a certain type of coffee bean has an anti-bacterial property			1
if it is drunk strong , black , without sugar , and in moderation , it could help keep teeth health			2
strong , black coffee drunk in moderation can actually help stop tooth decay , research shows			1
scientists from @entity29 's @entity28 tested extracted baby teeth with extract from @entity32 scientists at @entity29 ’s @entity28 tested extracted baby teeth with an extract from @entity32 , a type of bean that makes up 30 per cent of the world ’s coffee			1
they found that the coffee actively broke down bacterial biofilms which cause dental plaques , a major cause of tooth decay			1
lead researcher @entity43 said : ‘ dental plaque is a classic complex biofilm and it ’s the main culprit in tooth decay and gum disease			2
‘ we are always looking for natural compounds – food and drink , even – that can have a positive impact on dental health			0
’ using milk teeth , donated by children , the team cultivated biofilms on tooth fragments using the bacteria in saliva samples			2
when the fragments were exposed in solution to an extract of coffee beans , the bacteria were broken down			0
the researchers think that polyphenol antioxidants in the coffee were probably responsible for the effect , but said more research is needed to establish a direct link			0
professor @entity72 , whose paper is published today in the journal letters in @entity75 , warned that too much coffee can still be bad for teeth			0
the researcher said : ‘ whilst this is an exciting result , we have to be careful to add that there are problems associated with excessive coffee consumption , including staining and the effects of acidity on tooth enamel			0
the bean is used in 30 per cent of the world 's coffee			1
it was found to break down bacterial bio films which cause dental plaques - a cause of tooth decay ‘ and if you take a lot of sugar and cream in your coffee , any positive effects on dental health are probably going to be cancelled out			1
’ eventually , the active chemicals could be extracted from coffee to be used in a mouthwash or toothpaste			0
separate research has found that a similar effect could be found in hop leaves used to make beer			0
scientists at @entity112 found the leaves contain polyphenols which can prevent the release of bacterial toxins in the mouth			2
@entity118 , writing in the @entity120 , said : ‘ every year , farmers harvest about 2,300 tons of hops in the @entity123 , but the bracts are not used for making beer and are discarded			0
‘ thus , there is potentially a large amount of bracts that could be repurposed for dental applications			0
