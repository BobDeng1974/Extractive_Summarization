among changes to apps , tile options and an improved search , @entity11 from the @entity13 team also confirmed the company will be bringing the @entity16 button back			1
@entity2 removed the button from the @entity19 operating system when it was released last year but many customers complained and demanded it was put back			1
the button was removed from @entity19 the lock screen is being turned into a ' cloud - powered photo frame ' that will shows photos stored on the device and in @entity31			1
@entity6 8.1 also includes a vastly improved ' search ' function , which allows a user to search for documents , apps , or items on the internet from a single search bar			1
it also allows users to see all their applications immediately in a grid by swiping down or pressing a button on - screen			0

users can also customize the @entity52 screen much more easily ; changing sizes of app icons or controlling which apps appear			0
for the first time , it will be possible to open two windows simultaneously in the new - look interface			0
@entity6 8.1 includes @entity2 's latest browser , @entity61 , and lets the user restore the address bar and tabs to the screen view			1
many customers said that the new @entity19 interface was too complicated , and sales of @entity69 and tablets have also eaten significantly into @entity2 's profits as users move away from desktop computers			1
screenshots leaked last month suggested that @entity2 would be reinstating the button and this latest video has confirmed it - albeit not directly			1
during the demonstration , @entity11 swipes between screens and lands on the desktop view			0
a @entity6 logo is shown in the bottom left - hand corner			0
although it will not be labelled ' start ' , the leaked screenshots suggested that @entity6 logo would takes the user straight to a grid of applications			1
to catch a glimpse of the button , skip to 2.11 in the video below			0
the new @entity6 8.1 also includes a vastly improved ' search ' function , which allows a user to search for documents , apps , or items on the internet from a single search bar			1
the feature resembles @entity102 's spotlight feature			0
the new software also allows users to see all their applications immediately in a grid by swiping up or pressing a button on - screen			0
this should make it easy for unfamiliar users to get to the app they want quickly			0
users can also customize the start screen much more easily , changing sizes of app icon ' tiles ' or controlling which apps appear			2
for the first time , it will be possible to open two windows simultaneously in the new - look interface			0
@entity6 8.1 includes @entity2 's latest browser , @entity61 , and lets the user restore the address bar and tabs to the screen view			1
@entity2 has introduced new app tile sizes to the @entity131 screen including small apps , pictured here for the @entity135 program app. @entity6 8.1 also has more personalisation options for tile colours and fonts that feature was missing in the initial version of @entity19 , which was designed to make the most of limited screen space on a tablet but tended to disorient traditional mouse and keyboard users			1
users will also no longer have to switch to the old desktop view to make changes in their default settings			0
but they will still have to switch back to a traditional desktop set - up to use some programs such as @entity152 or @entity153 , which have not been redesigned to function in the new @entity19 style			0
@entity6 8.1 - codenamed @entity6 - is expected to launch later this year			2
executives say the plan is now to update @entity6 periodically , rather than waiting three years or so between big releases			2
the world 's largest software company is hoping to kickstart sales of its latest @entity6 version , which has not made the splash with computer users it was hoping for			2
although @entity2 has sold more than 100 million @entity6 8 licenses since october , broadly in line with @entity6 7 three years ago , the company must tackle a dwindling pc user base and its inability to make a mark in the exploding tablet market			1
the lock screen on @entity6 is being replaced by a ' cloud - powered photo frame ' that automatically pulls in images from @entity31 accounts shipments of traditional pcs - the most reliable gauge of @entity6 ' popularity - are expected to fall almost 8 percent this year , while @entity179 has taken less than 2 percent of the tablet market			2
@entity19 was designed to be used both on touch - screen tablets and traditional @entity182 but while touch - screen users tend to like the new ' tile ' - based interface , many mouse and keyboard users complained that the new design was confusing			0
@entity6 will be available for free to all @entity6 8 users some time later this year			2
@entity2 will make a test version available at its annual developer conference on june 26			0
@entity19 was launched in october last year			2
@entity2 chose to remove the start button as part of the interface overhaul			1
this angered many users who said the new software was too complicated to use			0
in response to this backlash , @entity2 is reinstating the button into @entity6 and making sorting apps and searching simpler			1

@entity6 is due to be released later this year and the ' start ' button will be making a *comeback*
