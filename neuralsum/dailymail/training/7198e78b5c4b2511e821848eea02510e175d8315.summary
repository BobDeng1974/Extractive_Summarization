by @entity0 last updated at 3:14 pm on 25th october 2011 the @entity1 has spoken for the first time of the ‘ horror ’ she felt at watching her mother die from osteoporosis			1
writing exclusively in the @entity6 today , she describes her anguish at watching her beloved ‘ @entity8 ’ , the @entity9 , die a ‘ crippling , slow and agonising death ’ from the fragile - bone disease			1
it is dubbed the silent epidemic			1
half of women and one in five men over the age of 50 will at some point suffer a fracture because of poor bone health			1
beloved : @entity22 with her mother in 1965 , who died from osteoporosis age 72 in 1994 three million people have been officially diagnosed with the disease , including an increasing number of those in their 20s and 30s			1
research suggests that an astonishing 1,150 sufferers die needlessly each month through a lack of early diagnosis and treatment			1
better care would save the @entity35 millions of pounds a day			1
@entity22 , as president of the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , has chosen ‘ to put her head above the parapet ’			1
she calls for an end to the huge variations of care throughout the country and for doctors to treat the condition more seriously and not just think of it as ‘ that old woman ’s disease ’			1
@entity49 of @entity51 's grandmother @entity50 also died from the disease her words are all the more thought - provoking because , not only did she lose her mother , who passed away in 1994 at the age of 72 , to the debilitating hereditary disease , but her maternal grandmother , @entity50 , too , just eight years earlier			2
@entity22 , 64 , has never commented publicly on her own health but it is understood that , thankfully , she does not show any sign of developing the affliction so far			2
‘ seeing someone you love die slowly , in agony , and knowing nothing about the disease that killed them is heart - breaking , ’ she writes			2
‘ in those days osteoporosis , a crippling bone disease , was seldom discussed , rarely diagnosed and usually attributed to old women with so - called “ @entity73 ’ humps ”			1
‘ my family and i watched in horror as my mother quite literally shrank in front of our eyes			2
she lost about eight inches in height and became so bent that she was unable to digest her food properly , leaving her with no appetite at all			2
‘ the local gp was kind and sympathetic but he , like us , was able to do little to alleviate the terrible pain @entity8 suffered so stoically			2
‘ in her later years she could not breathe without oxygen or totter around her beloved garden on her @entity91 frame			2
‘ i believe that the quality of her life became so dismal , and her suffering so unbearable , that she just gave up the fight and lost the will to live			2
’ the duchess explains that her own need for answers – not to mention the shocking ignorance of the medical profession – led her to the @entity37			1
@entity101 : is it any wonder that when the supposed fairy tale romance of @entity105 and @entity106 went seriously and shockingly wrong , that a dismayed and credulous @entity108 public went on a frenzied and hysterical witch hunt ? they soon found their quarry ; she had been as good as identified by @entity106 herself , in her tearful @entity114 interview : @entity22			2
yet slowly , @entity22 has been gaining ground and her relationship with the new @entity117 has been a key factor in this rehabilitation			0
read more here she was particularly surprised to learn that a simple bone density scan , known as a @entity122 , is all it takes to diagnose osteoporosis at the earliest possible stage			0
worryingly , however , only one in ten women and one in 50 men who have suffered a broken bone are being offered the vital follow - up scan when they go into hospital for medical treatment			1
this is largely down to the @entity108 ’s infamous ‘ postcode lottery ’ health service and often depends on whether your health authority offers a fracture liaison service			0
the reason why these scans are so important is that , because they can not feel their bones getting weaker , sufferers are often unaware they have a problem until they sustain their first fracture			0
catching the onset of osteoporosis early also allows sufferers to take simple steps to prevent its progression , such as introducing a healthy , calcium - rich diet ; incorporating gentle load - bearing exercise into their daily routine such as walking and dancing ( the duchess is a particular advocate of hiking – ‘ it ’s what i love to do – just get out there , walking ’ , she says ) ; or , for those at highest risk of fracture , beginning treatment with drugs			1
@entity22 , 64 , has never commented on her own health , but it is understood she does not show any sign of developing the affliction so far the charity is also campaigning to bring down the shocking number of deaths each month as a result of fragile bones			0
many of these 1,150 victims are elderly people who contract infections either before or after treatment or simply die before they can be operated on			1
during a meeting last week with sufferers at @entity181 , prince @entity105 ’s @entity182 residence , to mark the organisation ’s 25th anniversary , @entity22 spoke openly of her concern that patients were getting a raw deal			0
‘ i find it very worrying indeed that people do not seem to be getting these @entity122 scans , ’ she told the @entity6			1
‘ it is such a simple way of diagnosing the disease at an early stage and yet the chances of you getting one often depend on where you live			0
‘ when we tried to speak to the doctors about my mother they just did n’t want to know			0
their attitude was , “ it ’s just another old woman , just take another paracetamol ”			0
if it was n’t for the @entity37 , i just would n’t have known what to do			0
’ the @entity37 are campaigning to reduce the number of people suffering unnecessarily because of fragile bones			0
for further information about its campaign for a break - free future visit www.nos.org.uk or call 01761 471771			0
the charity also runs a staffed helpline 9am – 5pm weekdays on 0845 450 0230			0
@entity22 is celebrating her tenth year as the president of the @entity37 , which is the only national charity to campaign for better diagnosis and prevention of the disease			1
she added : ‘ tragically , it was too late for my mother , but that should n’t be the case now			0
as she spoke in the sun - dappled @entity222 , surrounded by family photographs including one of the wedding of the @entity227 and @entity117 and another of the recent christening of two of her five grandchildren , the duchess looked thoughtful			1
‘ you know , this has been a very personal journey for us as a family , ’ she said			0
‘ it ’s nothing to do with who i am now , it ’s about watching someone very much loved die in front of you , in complete agony , and not be able to do a thing about it			0
‘ we really must do more to raise the profile of this hugely prevalent but ultimately preventable disease			0
please do what you can to help us			0
