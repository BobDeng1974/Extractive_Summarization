by @entity1 reporter more signs that there was once water on @entity5 have been uncovered by a @entity7 rover			1
a rock crushed under the @entity6 's wheels split open to reveal a dazzling white interior - a sign that it contains hydrated minerals , formed when water flowed through it , scientists say			1
@entity16 drilled from a @entity5 rock last week revealed evidence of drinkable water and conditions favourable to life			1
now instruments on the rover have found more water - bearing minerals in the area around the rock			2
@entity7 images of a rock known as ' @entity29 ' broken under one of the @entity6 's wheels reveals its striking white interior			1
powder drilled from @entity5 rocks has revealed evidence of drinkable water and conditions favourable to life water - bearing minerals in @entity29 and elsewhere have added to a list of water evidence at the area			1
@entity6 is exploring a region within @entity41 , near the @entity5 equator , called @entity43			1
scientists believe that billions of years ago water poured down the rim of the crater and formed streams that might have been up to three feet deep			1
the new discoveries were made using the infrared imaging capability of @entity6 's mast camera , and an instrument that shoots neutron particles into the ground to probe for hydrogen			0
differences in brightness between near - infrared wavelengths of light can indicate the presence of some hydrated minerals that have been altered by water			1
an image captured by the @entity64 ( @entity65 ) on @entity7 's @entity5 rover @entity6 revealing interesting internal color in this rock which was broken by @entity6 when it drove over it water - bearing minerals in @entity29 and elsewhere have added to a list of water evidence at the area ' with @entity65 , we see elevated hydration signals in the narrow veins that cut many of the rocks in this area , ' said dr @entity77 , from the @entity78 in @entity79			1
' these bright veins contain hydrated minerals that are different from the clay minerals in the surrounding rock matrix			1
' the @entity86 - made @entity85 ( @entity85 ) instrument detected hydrogen in water molecules bound into minerals in the soil beneath the rover			2
the rock is made up of a fine - grained mudstone containing clay minerals , sulfate minerals and other chemicals			2
the patch of bedrock where @entity6 drilled for its first sample lies in an ancient network of stream channels descending from the rim of @entity41			2
this ancient wet environment , unlike some others on @entity5 , was not harshly oxidizing , acidic or extremely salty			0
the bedrock also is fine - grained mudstone and shows evidence of multiple periods of wet conditions , including nodules and veins			0
@entity43 contained more water than other areas previously visited by @entity6 , the results showed			0
' more water is detected at @entity43 than earlier on the route , ' said @entity85 deputy principal investigator dr @entity117 , from the @entity118 in @entity119			0
' even within @entity43 , we see significant variation			0
' the findings were presented at the @entity124 and @entity123 in @entity125 , @entity126			0
just last week @entity7 announced that analysis of a rock sample collected by the rover found key chemical ingredients that show @entity5 could once have supported primitive life			0
scientists identified sulphur , nitrogen , hydrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and carbon - some of the key chemical ingredients for life - in the powder @entity6 drilled out of a sedimentary rock near an ancient stream bed			0
the data indicated the @entity144 the rover is exploring was the end of an ancient river system or an intermittently wet lake bed that could have provided chemical energy and other favourable conditions for microbes			0
' we have found a habitable environment that is so benign and supportive of life , that probably if this water was around and you had been there , you would have been able to drink it , ' said project scientist @entity158 at the @entity159 , lead scientist for @entity7 's @entity160 at the agency 's headquarters in @entity163 , added : ' a fundamental question for this mission is whether @entity5 could have supported a habitable environment			2
' from what we know now , the answer is yes			0

*curiosity* is exploring a region within @entity41 , near the @entity5 equator
@entity174 split open to reveal dazzling white interior - sign of hydrated minerals
