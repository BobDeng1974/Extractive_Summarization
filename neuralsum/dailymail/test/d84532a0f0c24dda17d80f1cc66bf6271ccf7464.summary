every police force in @entity2 and @entity3 will be required to record @entity5 hate crimes and treat them as seriously as anti-semitic attacks if the @entity7 win the next general election , @entity0 has announced			1
in a move hailed by @entity12 groups , mrs may said that police will have to record islamophobic attacks as a separate category , just as anti-semitic crimes are recorded separately			1
at present some forces , including @entity19 ’s @entity18 , do record islamophobic crimes as such			1
other forces categorise them as hate crimes or specific offences such as assault or grievous bodily harm			1
charities say there has been a steady rise of @entity5 hate crimes since 9/11			1
but after incidents such as the murder of drummer @entity42 outside @entity44 barracks in 2013 and the @entity46 attacks in january , there are spikes in incidents in the @entity34 , say experts			2
mrs may made her pledge in a speech on counter-extremism to the @entity53 in @entity19 just before @entity54 was dissolved			0
she told the conference : ‘ we will require police forces to record @entity5 crimes as well as anti-semitic crimes			1
’ on the same day , mrs may answered a question from @entity62 mp @entity61 in @entity54 , who asked what steps the government was taking to record @entity5 hate crimes			1
mrs may said : ‘ a conservative government would require the police to be recording @entity68 hate crime , @entity5 incidents , as well as anti-semitic incidents			1
’ the @entity71 does not publish national statistics for islamophobic offences			2
the move by mrs may , pictured here with prime minister @entity76 , has been hailed by @entity12 groups but in 2013 - 14 , police recorded 44,480 hate crimes , an increase of five per cent over the same period the previous year across @entity2 and @entity3			2
the vast majority – 37,484 – were race - hate crimes			2
@entity84 , a government - backed @entity12 group , said that more than half of all the victims ( 54 per cent ) of islamophobic incidents are women , perhaps because they ‘ appear more @entity12 ’ , wearing the burka or headscarf			0
tell @entity94 figures show that in the ten months after the @entity42 attack , a total of 734 incidents were reported to the organisation – an increase of 20 per cent on the same period the previous year			0
the most serious incident is believed to be the frenzied knife attack on @entity103 student @entity102 , 31 , in @entity104 , @entity105 , in june last year			0
detectives believe she was attacked because she was wearing @entity12 clothes			0
so far no one has been arrested for the murder			0
@entity111 , a patron of @entity84 , said of mrs may ’s speech : ‘ this is a positive step forward			0
’ the @entity114 has also welcomed the proposal			0
@entity116 , the group ’s former @entity117 , said : ‘ this change will bring parity between @entity68 and @entity122 groups			0

all police would record @entity5 hate crimes if @entity7 win the election
islamophobic attacks would be separate category , like anti-semitic crimes
at present some police forces , including @entity18 , record these crimes as such
would create accurate picture of the extent of these hate crimes in @entity34
