by @entity0 published : 14:56 est , 5 may 2013 updated : 07:48 est , 6 may 2013 hundreds of people have spent their bank holiday weekend scrambling though 400 - yards of foul - smelling muck for the annual @entity4			0
the 300 competitors , many wearing fancy dress , ran , crawled and scrabbled across the thick black mud of the @entity8 in @entity9 at low tide and back yesterday			1
each year competitors attempt to dash across the bed of the river near @entity14 , and luckily this year the sun was out to keep the mud - racers warm			1
the crazy competitors crawl through metres of sticky mud to reach the finish line before the tide comes in			2
the event sees a number of competitors dressed in wacky costumes , which makes the task of crossing the finish line somewhat harder			2
the first edition of the race was held in 1973 in the thick of it : a competitor in distress attempts to crawl through the muddy sludge in trouble : a competitor tumbles down the mudbanks of the @entity36 river meanwhile , an even bigger event in @entity53 saw thousands of people taking part in an 11 mile endurance event complete with 22 military - style obstacles			2
around 14,000 participants would have been left uttering ' muddy hell ' as they descended on @entity60 in @entity61 as they aimed to complete the gruelling @entity63 circuit			1
big names also taking part in the mud run were @entity67 and @entity69 assistant coach @entity68 and attacking skills coach @entity70 , who both completed what organisers describe as ' probably the toughest event on the planet '			1
at the finish line there was no prize for ' mudders ' - who fought through fire , plunged into icy water , scaled 12ft walls , waded through muddy swamps , crawled through underground tunnels and navigated wires electrically charged with 10,000 volts - other than a @entity86 orange headband and a t - shirt to mark their success			0
the name of the game is teamwork and camaraderie because it is almost impossible to finish the course alone , a @entity63 spokeswoman said			2
' the big thing is that it 's not a competition , it 's not a race			0
it 's a challenge so a lot of the obstacles you have to do in a team , ' she said			0
' you get headbands at the end to show you 've completed the course			0
it 's about teamwork , camaraderie , bonding			0
' muddy waters : competitors leave the freezing water and enter the thick mud out the otherside : the competitors cross the river then get reduced to a crawl each year competitors attempt to dash across the bed of the river near @entity14 , and luckily this year the sun was out to keep the mud - racers warm the event sees a number of competitors dressed in wacky costumes , which makes the task of crossing the finish line somewhat harder charity fund raiser @entity130 celebrates as he scrambles up the river bank to the finish line of the annual @entity4 race in @entity14 , @entity9 a participant recovers after taking part in the annual @entity4 in @entity14 , @entity9 competitors shower after competitors shower after scrambling though 400 - yards of foul - smelling muck for the annual @entity4 mudders taking part yesterday were treated to a bit of extra dirt and dampness as rain and hail fell on the @entity53 course , but today 's participants benefited from some rare bank holiday weekend sunshine			1
as the event has grown in popularity it has seen more of a mix of people taking part and more women are now taking on the challenge , and more mixed sex teams are entering , the spokeswoman said			0
@entity160 , @entity63 @entity161 's vice president , said : ' after an overwhelming reception last year , 2013 is set to be a really exciting year for @entity63 and we definitely started with a bang in @entity61			1
the rain and the hail added to the tonnes of mud on site as the course lived up to its name			0
participants braved muddy trenches , and waist - high swamps the course was designed by @entity175			0
on average , only 78 per cent of participants finish the course , while average time is 2.5 hours the course features a 12 - 15 mile trail run , containing more than 20 military - style obstacles @entity67 and @entity69 assistant coach @entity68 take part in @entity63 2013 at @entity60 , @entity61 @entity67 rugby attack coach @entity70 takes part in the challenge today while the south of the country will continue to bask in the blazing heat tomorrow , it is likely to remain cloudy with outbursts of rain in the north east and @entity193 obstacles differ from place to place , with each and every one presenting a challenge of the body and mind ' the @entity201 were amazing and not only braved one of our toughest courses yet , but also the erratic weather ! ' we 're now looking forward to @entity206 in june for what should be another a great event			1
' founded and run by @entity209 and @entity210 , @entity63 has already established itself in @entity211 , @entity212 and now the @entity161 since its launch in may 2010 , and @entity63 recently signed up its one millionth participant worldwide			2
tough @entity63 has increased the number of @entity161 events from three to six this year with the next event @entity218 taking place at @entity206 near @entity220 on june 8 and 9 .			1
