it started out as a sweet family moment on a day trip to the zoo : a little girl beating her chest at a gorilla , safely separated by a pane of glass			1
but it seems the @entity10 at the @entity12 zoo was less amused			1
the massive animal - who had been standing at the back of the enclosure - clearly decides enough is enough , and runs at the onlookers			0
@entity18 : the little girl can be seen in the window beating her chest at one of the gorillas cross : but the gorilla 's friend in the background is n't quiet as keen on the game sprint : and he decided the time had come to do something about it - so started running towards the glass heavy : the gorilla throws his entire weight at the pane of glass at @entity38 's @entity37 the gorilla then launches himself , and his hundreds of pounds , at the little girl , hitting the glass with such force it cracks			1
the terrified family have fled to safety in the meantime			2
the incident took place at @entity38 's @entity49 yesterday , and since it was uploaded to @entity50 it has had more than 126,000 views			1
writing on @entity54 , the person who uploaded the video revealed : ' the person added : ' shortly before this we were telling the kids they could not break it			2
they will never believe us again			0
' sadly the one beating her chest really started crying			0
' they added : ' i came back a couple of minutes later , and the zoo keepers were telling people to stay away			0
' horror : the family 's terrified reactions were captured in the glass the moment they gorilla hit impact : the force is so much the glass cracks on impact - sending the family fleeing huge : mountain gorillas like this one can weigh as muhc as 485lb , or 220kg male mountain gorillas , which can reach the age of 40 , weigh between 300 and 485lb ( 220kg )			1
they are classified as an endangered species , and @entity82 is famous for its gorilla breeding programme			0
the zoo was responsible for the first gorilla test tube baby in 1995 , and now boasts the largest gorilla sperm bank in the world .			0
