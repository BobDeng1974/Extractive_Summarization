by @entity1 reporter published : 16:47 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 16:48 est , 11 october 2012 the meticulous attention to detail , the subject matter - not to mention the material used - all hark back to bygone days			0
and sure enough this replica of @entity7 made entirely out of matchsticks was built is a product of a less - frenzied time			0
it began in 1957 when @entity12 requested the palace plans from the @entity15 's superintendent			1
meticulous : the 90:1 scale model of @entity7 assembled from 39,000 matchsticks the talented modeller took nearly three years painstakingly making the 5ft long object and used 39,000 matchsticks			1
after he died the delicate model was handed down to step - daughter @entity22 who kept it out of the reach of children on top of her wardrobe			1
it was eventually inherited by her granddaughter @entity29 , who as a child used to stand on her nan ’s bed and gaze at it during visits			0
mrs @entity29 , 39 , has now shown the incredibly detailed model off for the first time after taking it along to the @entity39 ’s @entity38			0

mrs @entity29 said : ‘ i always remember standing on my nan ’s bed to look at this fantastic palace that has spent most of its life on top of her wardrobe			2
‘ the model is five feet long and she lived in a three - bed semi detached house in @entity59 so i do n’t think she had the room for it			1
‘ she stored it on her wardrobe so it was out of the way but also to keep it safe from children			2
‘ she died a few years ago and the one thing i hoped to inherit was this model of @entity7			2
‘ but it went to her son and my uncle who , rather ironically , put it on top of his wardrobe due to a lack of room			2
‘ after three or four years he realised how much i liked it and gave it to me			0
‘ i keep it on a chest of drawers on my landing but it was only when the @entity38 visited the area that i thought about showing it to a wider audience			0
’ mr @entity12 was a talented model - maker and went into great detail when creating the miniature palace , including getting the famous balcony absolutely right			1
the windows are made out of clear perspex and he placed toy horses and a carriage in the front courtyard			0
