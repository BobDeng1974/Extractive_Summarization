by @entity0 you never get a second chance to make a first impression , so they say			2
in which case pity @entity8 , the new president of @entity10 , whose first day at the office turned into something of a damp squib			2
to top it all , there was even a whiff of scandal , as his appointment of @entity60 , convicted of corruption in the 1990s , as prime minister was met with raised eyebrows			2
with @entity10 and much of @entity64 looking on at the newcomer , mr @entity8 ’s day started well enough			2
he exchanged pleasantries with predecessor @entity67 at the @entity34 and , in a ceremony deliberately kept low key – to distinguish him from the outgoing ‘ president @entity71 ’ – he was sworn in as the seventh president of the @entity74			0
raining on his parade : in weather that could have been orchestrated by his opponent @entity67 , the heavens opened on mr @entity8 's motorcade through @entity24 still chucking it down : mr @entity8 endured more outdoor ceremonies in the rain yesterday as he placed flowers at the monument to the unknown soldier at the @entity25 @entity10 's newly - elected president @entity8 arrives for the handover ceremony mr @entity8 then spoke sombrely of the hard times ahead : ‘ i will propose to my @entity64 partners a pact that ties the necessary reduction of deficit to the indispensable stimulation of the economy			1
‘ power at the summit of the state will be exercised with dignity but simplicity , with a great ambition for our country but a scrupulous sobriety of behaviour			0
’ so far , so good			0
but then it all went wrong			1
perched through the sunroof of a small £ 25,000 hybrid @entity108 , and surrounded by guardsmen on horse - back , he was driven up the @entity111 waving to well - wishers			1
unfortunately the heavens opened on mr @entity8 ’s big moment			0
by the time he arrived at the @entity25 he resembled a business - like version of @entity117 ’s @entity116 , emerging dripping wet from a dip in the lake			0
@entity120 : @entity44 chancellor @entity46 welcomes @entity10 president @entity8 at the @entity123 in @entity50 warm welcome : the new @entity10 president was received in @entity44 by chancellor @entity46 ( left ) and an honour guard , before the pair sat down for talks problems : talks between the two leaders are expected to be dominated by @entity64 's debt crisis his black suit was sodden			1
his best white shirt clung to his body and rain fell from his spectacles			0
if he thought things would improve when he boarded his plane to meet mrs @entity46 , he was wrong			1
his @entity141 was hit by lightning and he was forced to return to @entity24 , to board a second aircraft			1
he arrived in @entity50 an hour and a half late – but his troubles did not end there			1
at the airport , he stood on the wrong side of the red carpet and had to be helpfully pushed along by mrs @entity46			1
but if mr @entity8 is really worried his tumultuous first few hours in charge have set the tone for his presidency , he could always remember that old standard for politicians : ‘ @entity153			0
’ video : what a first day for @entity8 ! ...			0

soaked to skin on *supposedly* *triumphant* parade along the @entity111
official plane hit by lightning and has to turn back
late for vital meeting with @entity44 leader @entity46 to save @entity163
blunders on red carpet by standing on wrong side in front of *photographers*
