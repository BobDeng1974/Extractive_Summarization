by @entity1 reporter published : 16:19 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 03:21 est , 29 january 2013 so - called eco-friendly cars are facing a crackdown in @entity4 after a scheme to encourage motorists to switch to ‘ greener ’ alternatives has started to make air more toxic			1
@entity9 is to remove the @entity11 exemption for diesels and some hybrids because soaring sales has increased pollution and traffic			1
diesels now account for one in two sales , but emit 22 times more soot particulates than petrol cars			1
end of the road : diesel and @entity23 cars are set to lose their @entity25 exemption because booming sales has led to increased polution the u-turn has provoked an outcry from motoring organisations , who accused authorities of moving the ‘ green goalposts ’			1
and the move is also expected to cause anger among motorists who bought their cars to take advantage of the exemption			1
@entity40 , @entity41 president , told the @entity42 : ‘ we do have real concerns about “ green goalposts ” being moved after drivers and businesses have invested in low - emission hybrid and diesel vehicles			0
we need to encourage the take - up of a range of greener vehicles			0
’ out of favour : @entity54 is one of more than 50 ' greener ' cars which are set to lose their @entity11 exemption @entity58 1.3 16v @entity59 1.6 @entity60 ( below ) @entity62 i10 @entity64 hatchback and estate @entity66 and @entity67 and @entity68 and @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 @entity75 - @entity74 @entity73 @entity72 more than 50 ‘ green ’ models , which includes the petrol / electric @entity54 — a favourite among environmentally conscious drivers - will no longer be exempt from the £ 10 charge			1
the move will come into force in july if approved by @entity83			0
it is understood the changes to the pricing will generate up to an extra £ 2 million a year			0
the additional revenue will go some way to plugging the £ 60 million lost since the abandoning the @entity11 ’s western extension			1
about 70,000 motorists a day enter the congestion zone , with 2,500 qualifying for @entity9 ’s @entity93 because they emit less than 100g/km of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide			1
@entity9 wants to scrap this limit and replace it with a much tougher 75g/km maximum in a new scheme — which effectively rules out all hybrid and diesel vehicles now on the road			0
@entity101 , the @entity102 ’s technical director , said that only pure electric cars are likely to meet those new rigorous pollution restrictions			2
applications for the @entity93 would cease to be accepted from july			0
but drivers already registered would continue to qualify for the exemption until june 2015			0
@entity9 , which made a £ 136.8 million net profit from the congestion charge in 2011/12 , believes the existing system ‘ creates an incentive ’ for owners of hybrid and diesel cars to enter the zone			2
it fears the number could more than double to 6,000 ‘ free ’ cars a day by the end of this year			2
the new rules would sit alongside a £ 10 increase in penalty fines — taking them to £ 130 — and the closure of c - charge payment points in shops and petrol stations			2
these changes would generate a further £ 2.5 million a year .			0

soaring sales of @entity11 exempt *eco-cars* making air quality worse
diesels emit 22 times more soot particles than petrol cars
