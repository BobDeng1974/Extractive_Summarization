@entity1 secretary @entity0 said on thursday he is ' mad as hell ' about allegations that @entity1 hospitals put patients on secret waiting lists			1
' i could use stronger language here , but in deference to the committee , i wo n't , ' @entity0 said in testimony before the @entity12 on @entity1 on thursday			1
@entity0 - who is a veteran himself - called the allegations ' completely unacceptable ' if true and promised that the @entity1 would take corrective action if necessary			1
' i would say that 40 , there 's more than that that i know of , but 40 's probably a good number , ' a former doctor at the facility told @entity28			2
@entity1 rules require hospitals to see veterans within two weeks to a month of their request for an appointment			2
in order to skirt the rules , employees of the @entity43 created an alternative system of scheduling that made it look like veterans were being seen in a timely manner when they were n't			0
wait times for appointments often took more than six months , and in one case took 21 months , the doctor said			2
at another hospital in @entity57 , @entity58 , employees were also instructed to ' game the system ' by listing veterans ' request for an appointment on a day where appointments were available instead of the day they first made the request , @entity54 reported last week			0
@entity0 told the @entity68 on thursday to his knowledge , the secret waiting lists were not used at @entity1 hospitals across the country			1
' i 'm not aware other than a number of isolated cases , where there is evidence of that , ' the retired four - star general said , but he noted it ' behooves ' the @entity1 to take a look into its hospitals to make sure			2
under secretary of veterans affairs for health @entity26 told @entity68 the @entity1 is ' working continuously ' to find out what @entity1 sites are using the secret lists			1
@entity1 acting inspector general @entity86 said on thursday that the @entity88 's office was looking into multiple lists provided to them , including some provided via hotlines after the @entity24 deaths became national news			1
' the number 40 that 's been wildly reported in the press , does not represent the total number of veterans we 're looking at , ' he said			0
the list it is currently looking at has only 17 individuals , he said , and their investigation has shown so far that while all of the veterans on the list died , it was not because they were denied care in a timely manner by the @entity1			1
there was a delay in care , the @entity1 's standards were not met , and there was ' some patient harm , ' but to draw the conclusion between that and death , has been ' tenuous , ' @entity107 , @entity1 assistant inspector general , said			1
in addition to the investigation underway by the va inspector general , @entity0 said his department would also be doing its own review of its practices			1
on wednesday , president @entity123 announced that @entity124 deputy chief of staff @entity125 would oversee the @entity1 's internal audit			1
' while we get to the bottom of what happened in @entity24 , it 's clear the @entity1 needs to do more to ensure quality care for our veterans , ' president @entity123 said in a statement			1
' i 'm grateful that @entity125 , one of my most trusted advisors , has agreed to work with secretary @entity0 to help the team at this important moment			2
' @entity0 said he welcomed @entity141 's participation on thursday , saying he has known @entity125 and his family for a long time			2
he said the @entity1 would let the @entity88 finish his review of the department 's practices before jumping to conclusions about the level of care other @entity1 hospitals provide			1
the embattled va secretary said he would not leave his position until he 'd completed his personal mission to improve health care for veterans or the @entity155 asks him to resign			0
veterans look on as @entity157 @entity1 secretary @entity0 testifies before a @entity160 hearing on @entity1 health care , on @entity162 @entity164 chairman @entity163 called for an independent investigation into the @entity1 on thursday morning			1
' our veterans are our heroes and they deserve better than a @entity124 insider - led investigation , ' he said			0
' yet again the @entity124 is trying to pass off a scandal as an isolated incident when in fact it continues to grow every day			0
' @entity172 legislative director @entity171 also called on an outside investigation in his testimony to @entity175 on thursday , while noting his organization stands behind @entity177			0
during thursday 's hearing , @entity179 chairman @entity178 questioned whether the @entity1 's internal audit was anything more than ' damage control			1
' how long will it be before there is a different approach or attitude at the @entity1 to solve the problem , @entity178 asked			0
' what is is this really going to accomplish ? ' @entity178 , who chaired the @entity1 subcommittee on health in the @entity124 before being elected to the @entity12 in 2010 , said a two - week investigation by the va that does n't look at every one of the its facilities can not be considered a thorough review			1
sen. @entity196 asked @entity0 why he had n't gotten the @entity197 involved in the investigation yet , as the manipulation of health records is a crime and the @entity1 is clearly understaffed			0
' i will work with the @entity88 to make that available to him if that is his request , ' @entity0 told @entity196			1
that 's something that is your job to do as @entity150 , @entity196 told him , especially in light of the of ' false statements to the government			0
' several senators asked @entity0 and @entity26 what would happen to the @entity1 employees involved in the cover up if the allegations turned out to be true			1
@entity0 again said he wanted to wait for the @entity88 to finish his report before deciding if employees of the @entity24 hospital and other hospitals allegedly behaving in inappropriate behavior would be fired			1
' there is a process here , @entity68 , ' @entity0 told @entity223 sen. @entity222			2
' let me not get ahead of it			0
' ' i do n't know whether that 's the appropriate level ' of discipline or not , @entity26 said of terminating employees involved			0
@entity0 said that other employees who have engaged in inappropriate behavior have either retired , been let go or reassigned in the past			0
@entity233 national commander @entity232 ( center ) has called for @entity0 's resignation over the scandal the @entity233 has called for @entity0 's resignation over a long list of grievances against the @entity1			2
the veterans organization has created a map of all the @entity1 facilities that contributed to veterans ' deaths by withholding necessary care			2
' i accept that there are places that are listed here where we have had adverse events , ' @entity0 said when confronted with the @entity233 's map			0
the @entity233 says that a number of veterans have died of serious diseases after being put on a wait list for simple procedures like a colonoscopy			0
' when are things going to get better ? ' @entity232 , @entity233 national commander , told the committee			0
@entity261 , national legislative director for @entity262 said his organization wants to give @entity0 the ' opportunity to get it right ' before it calls for his resignation			0
' if that means people have to be fired , so be it , ' he said			0
the @entity24 facility 's director , associate director and another director have been put on leave , @entity1 acting inspector general @entity86 said on thursday			1
he said the investigation , which a group of 185 health inspectors have been working on for three weeks , could take until august to complete			0
' remember part of this review could result in criminal charges being brought , ' he told @entity68 who wanted to know why his office expected it to take so long .			0

at least 40 veterans died after a @entity1 facility in @entity24 , @entity25 , placed them on secret waiting lists that left them without care for as many as 21 months
@entity1 secretary @entity0 told the @entity12 on @entity1 that the was ' mad as hell ' about the allegations
@entity0 said the allegations are ' completely unacceptable ' if true
the va inspector general testified on thursday that his office had only looked at the deaths of 17 veterans thus far
while the veterans were not treated to the @entity1 's standards , that was not why they died , he said
the @entity88 says it could take until august to do a thorough review of the nation 's va hospitals
senator @entity178 said the @entity1 's internal audit seemed like nothing more than ' damage control ' and a measure to help the @entity1 save face
other groups , including the @entity164 and the @entity262 , have called for independent *oversight* of the review
