by @entity0 published : 10:23 est , 1 august 2012 updated : 12:42 est , 1 august 2012 as the worst drought in more than half a century continues to afflict the @entity4 , the price of corn surged by 20 per cent in july - the biggest two - month rally since the last major drought in 1988			1
two - thirds of the continental @entity8 is now suffering from the most widespread drought since the 1950s			1
and the lack or rain in @entity13 's breadbasket is intensifying at an unprecedented rate , driving concern food prices could soar if crops in the world 's key producer are decimated			0
the latest @entity19 reported a nearly threefold increase in areas of extreme drought in the course of a single week in the nine @entity4 states where three - quarters of the country 's corn and soybean crops are produced			1

above , a field of dead corn sits next to an ethanol plant in @entity35 , @entity36 last week the percentage of the nation 's corn crop rated very poor or poor rose to 48 per cent in the week ending july 29 , while 47 per cent of the soybean crop was in very poor or poor condition , according to the @entity8 @entity42			1
that is the worst rating since the drought of 1988 , which cut production by 20 per cent and cost the economy tens of billions of dollars			1
the @entity8 @entity42 last week raised its estimates of food price inflation due to soaring grain prices tied to the drought , saying prices could rise as much as 3.5 per cent this year and another 3 to 4 per cent in 2013 , led by meat			1
and with grazing pastures also parched and feed prices at record highs , many ranchers are sending their animals to slaughter early because it is too costly to keep them until full size			1
buyers in @entity61 and other hungry nations are concerned that the expected sharp drop in @entity8 harvests will cause shortages and price spikes			1
above , a drought - damaged corn field near @entity68 , @entity36 meteorologists said there were chances for rain through the weekend in the @entity4 farm belt			2
' the @entity8 weather model has a little wetter forecast than yesterday , but overall it looks like a similar pattern in august that we saw at the end of july , ' said @entity79 , meteorologist for @entity80			2
he said 0.25 to 0.75 inch of rain could fall into the weekend in the northern and eastern @entity4 , with about 70 per cent coverage			0
from 0.10 to 0.50 inch of rain was forecast for the central and southern @entity4 , with 50 per cent coverage			0
the rains could benefit the soybean crop , which will be setting pods the next two weeks - a crucial phase in their reproductive cycle that determines yield and final production			1
agronomists had said that the hardy soybean crop needs just a fifth of the rain that corn needs due to its much smaller biomass , and that timely rains could help soybeans flourish			2
president @entity103 's administration has opened up protected @entity8 land to help farmers and ranchers and has encouraged crop insurance companies to forgo charging interest for a month			1
it has also provided emergency low - interest loans to farmers in the 1,234 counties across 31 states which have been declared disaster areas due to the drought			2
local governments are also trying to help			0
the state of @entity118 has offered millions in grants to help farmers and ranchers drill or deepen wells and expand irrigation systems			0
experts predict there will still be a sizable harvest -- just not anywhere close to the bounty of recent years or the bumper crop predicted before the rain stopped			0
and that will likely bring price increases for food and all types of products for years to come			2
' we 're not just talking about the fact that things are going to be tight here in the @entity8 , ' said @entity138 , senior economist with @entity139			2
' when you look at such a large portion of the corn and soybean crop that gets exported , you 're going to talk about substantially impacting a number of other marketplaces			2
' the impact spreads far beyond just cereal or bread - or a single growing season - because so much of the @entity8 crop is used as livestock feed and those herds are being culled , @entity146 said			1
the @entity8 @entity42 has raised its estimates of food price inflation due to soaring grain prices tied to the drought , saying prices could rise as much as 3.5 per cent this year			1
above , @entity159 cooperative extension agent @entity158 , studies non-irrigated stunted cotton plants on a farm in @entity163 , @entity164 the percentage of the nation 's corn crop rated very poor or poor rose to 48 per cent in the week ending july 29 , while 47 per cent of the soybean crop was in very poor or poor condition , according to the @entity8 @entity42			1
above , water levels at the @entity171 are six feet ( nearly 2m ) below normal due to the early culls , getting the @entity8 cattle herds back up to pre-drought levels would take at least two years , he said , warning that pork and poultry production was also at risk			1
out in the fields , many farmers are trying to salvage what they can by chopping the stunted plants into feed for livestock			0
so few ears of corn are growing , it just is n't worth harvesting			0
worries about the worst drought in more than half a century afflicting the world 's largest grain exporter also deepened overseas			1
buyers in @entity61 and other hungry nations are concerned that the expected sharp drop in @entity8 harvests will cause shortages and price spikes			1
one of the top corporate leaders in agriculture warned that the government must act quickly to reduce the amount of corn going into ethanol to prevent a sharp spike in food prices			0
@entity207 , chief executive of global grains trading giant @entity208 , joined a chorus of critics of biofuels by urging the @entity8 government to temporarily curb its quotas to produce corn - based ethanol fuel			1
@entity207 said on @entity216 that the @entity8 biofuel mandate ' needs to be addressed ' through existing policy tools			2
otherwise , the spike in @entity8 corn and soybean prices to record highs will ' ration ' demand in ways that will hurt food production too much			1
' if all of that is only on livestock or food consumers , it really makes the burden disproportionate			0
' what we see are 3 or 4 percent declines in supply lead to 40 to 50 per cent increases in prices , and i think the mandates are what drives that , ' he said			0
in 2011 , almost 40 per cent of the giant @entity8 corn crop went into making ethanol , and the @entity8 still exported more than half of all corn shipments worldwide			1
' there is a methodology to reduce the amount of biofuels that is mandated in the @entity8 , ' @entity207 said			1
on monday , @entity8 livestock groups appealed to the @entity252 ( @entity252 ) to curb or suspend the mandate , warning against the ruinous impact of soaring feed costs			2
corn and soybean meal make up basic animal feedstuffs			0
grain analysts polled by @entity260 pointed to a @entity8 corn crop of 11.2 billion bushels , the smallest in six years and down 14 per cent from @entity42 's latest forecast of 12.97 billion			1
initial forecasts were for a crop of more than 14 billion bushels			0
soybeans , which were planted later and until now escaped the drought 's pressure , are now also being hurt			0
analysts predict a 2.834 billion bushel harvest , the smallest in four years , and down from @entity42 's latest estimate of 3.05 billion bushels			0
oilseed processor and ethanol producer @entity271 reported a larger than expected 25 per cent drop in quarterly profit yesterday due in part to higher corn prices causing it to lose money making ethanol			0
' in a challenging fourth quarter , solid results from our global oilseeds business , particularly in @entity13 , were more than offset by negative @entity8 ethanol margins and weaker @entity8 merchandising results , ' @entity271 ceo @entity280 said			2
@entity287 last week lowered its earnings forecasts for @entity8 pork producer @entity289 and @entity8 chicken producer @entity290 , citing corn prices			0
but some said that easing off ethanol production - already at a two - year low amid soaring corn prices - was unnecessary			0
in @entity299 , the largest @entity8 corn and soybean producer , gov. @entity297 said he opposed an ethanol waiver			2
' even if you took that kind of action , it probably would have no action on soybean and corn prices , ' @entity297 said			0
@entity307 of @entity308 , @entity299 , a soybean farmer and industry official now touring @entity61 , said he has been reassuring the worried @entity61 , who are the biggest importers of @entity8 soybeans			1
' as we have met with folks from the government , as well as the @entity61 media and our customers themselves , that is absolutely the very top thing on their mind , ' he said			0
at the @entity323 , corn and soybean markets eased back from new record highs this week as traders took their profits			0
december corn futures closed down 1.1 per cent at $ 8.05 - 1/4 per bushel and november soybeans closed down 0.2 per cent at $ 16.41 per bushel			0
' we are continuing to see a deterioration of the crops , ' grains analyst @entity329 of @entity331 in @entity332 , @entity299 said , referring to the @entity8 @entity42 's crop progress report issued on monday			1
that report said 24 per cent of the domestic corn crop was in good - to - excellent condition as of sunday , down from 26 per cent the previous week			0
that was slightly better than trade expectations for a three - point drop			0
the soybean crop was 29 per cent in that category , down from 31 per cent in the previous week			0
those ratings were the worst for those crops since the last major drought in 1988 .			2

food price inflation could rise by as much as 3.5 **%** this year , says @entity8 @entity42
percentage of crop rated ' very poor ' or ' poor ' rose to 48 **%** - the worst rating since the 1988 drought
