sex surfing : the world 's most popular internet porn searches have been revealed a country by country list of top search terms used at pornography websites has revealed vastly different preferences among individual nations when it comes to surfing the net behind closed doors			1
from the man caves of @entity16 to the laptops of @entity18 the unusual and often disturbing tastes of porn fans around the world have been laid well and truly bare			0
while in @entity21 the preferred search term is ' milf ' , ( an acronym of which the first word is ' mother ' ) , in @entity26 there is appears to be a strong national bias			2
@entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and the @entity36 are porno patriots preferring to search for women or men from their own countries			2
but then you get to @entity42 where there seems to be is a preference for senior citizens with ' mature ' and ' granny ' the top two search terms respectively , while in @entity51 the term ' woodman ' rates highly			2
things start to get peculiar when you hit the @entity53 where ' raincoat ( gay ) ' is the top search , before becoming hugely disturbing in @entity57 where ' mom and son ' is the most popular term			0
but it is in @entity62 and the @entity63 that things really start to get weird			0
in @entity66 , where you might imagine people have little time for porn considering recent events , the preferred search is ' aunt ' while in @entity75 the peculiar term ' hotel businessman ( gay ) ' is riding high at no.6			2
in @entity21 , where internet porn is a billion dollar business and the majority of adult sites are based , tastes appear to vary wildly from state to state			0
in the southern states of @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity89 ' @entity88 ' is the most popular term used			0
@entity90 tastes : the most popular searches for porn - broken down here to the top three searches by country - reveal most @entity26 want films made in their own country @entity97 : in @entity21 , where internet porn is a billion dollar business and the majority of adult sites are based , tastes appear to vary wildly from state to state porn users in @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 prefer ' teen '			1
meanwhile @entity119 like ' @entity120 ' , in @entity122 it 's ' lesbian ' while @entity124 bucks the trend with ' free gay porn '			1
the rugged ideal of the buff , beer - swilling @entity127 male appears hard to resist too with ' aussie ( gay ) ' the top search term down under			0
and in @entity134 it would appear straight men have little time for internet porn with all of the top 10 searches being gay terms			0
peculiarities : @entity75 are fond of using the term ' hotel businessman ' while in @entity51 ' woodman ' is popular secret surfing : a leading pornography search engine has revealed the most popular search terms from around the world the prominence of gay search terms is a trait that is repeated across south @entity21 - perhaps due to religion - although like @entity26 there appears to be a bias towards searches for people of their own nationalities			1

the list was compiled by pornography search engine @entity165 which has created an interactive global map where you can check the top searches on your country or @entity173 state .			1
