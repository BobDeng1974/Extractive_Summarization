dressed in identical outfits and smiling sweetly for the camera , it 's hard to believe these healthy twin toddlers were not expected to survive			1
@entity4 and @entity5 , two , from @entity6 in south east @entity7 , were born joint at the abdomen sharing the same intestines and a team of 15 doctors spent five hours separating the pair			1
a life - threatening blockage meant they were transferred to @entity17 for emergency surgery but almost three years on and the identical twins are fighting fit			1
she said : ' wherever they are , they need to know where the other is			0
even at nursery surrounded by all their little friends , they are constantly looking to see where the other one is			0
' if i 'm getting @entity25 dressed first , @entity4 will run off , find the exact same outfit and pester me until i dress her exactly the same			1
it 's been like that ever since we brought them home			0
' they used to crawl around the house chasing one another			0
normally @entity4 will learn something first - like talking - and within a week @entity25 will have caught up - they 're just little copycats really			1
' mrs @entity29 was only 16 weeks pregnant when a scan revealed to her and taxi - driver husband , @entity55 , 39 , that the twins were conjoined			1
together : @entity25 and @entity4 , who were born with the same intestine in july 2012 , are ' inseparable ' the couple , who also have a seven - year - old daughter , @entity24 , prepared themselves for the worst as doctors gave the girls a small chance of survival as they could n't definitively see where the connection was			1
conjoined twins occur every 200,000 births , however , as few as five per cent of those births actually survive being born			1
mrs @entity29 , a full - time mother , said : ' hearing the girls were conjoined was the shock of our lives			1
' i 'd heard of it , but i never expected it to happen to me			0
i was nervous the whole way through the pregnancy but tried to shut it to the back of my mind			0
' when i heard their two little cries when they were born , the worry subsided , but only for a while			2
' almost immediately after being delivered by caesarean section at @entity87 , @entity7 , @entity4 and @entity25 were whisked off to @entity17 to be operated on			1
they were delivered at 34 weeks and weighed 5lb 3oz each and the following day they were operated on to clear a life - threatening intestinal blockage			2
' those were the most difficult 24 hours of our lives , ' mrs @entity29 added			1
' having my babies taken off my almost immediately after they 're born and not knowing if either would survive was heartbreaking			1
' when the doctors came out to say the surgery had been a success and that the girls were both fine , it was like the world had been lifted off our shoulders			1
complications : @entity4 , left , and @entity25 , right , were born joined at the abdomen and shared part of the intestine sisters : the girls spent a few weeks in hospital before returning home to be with their big sister @entity24 ( centre ) ' seeing their little bodies in two separate cots , instead of one , i just burst into tears			1
' mrs @entity29 and the girls spent another four and a half weeks in hospital to make sure they were healthy enough to go home			1
the couple say that even when they were given the all clear they still were n't full prepared to bring both girls home so everything was a ' bit last minute '			2
' on the drive back we had to buy bottles from boots			0
during the pregnancy i could n't see us getting to the point where both our little girls would survive			2
' toddlers : the identical twins love to dress in matching outfits ( left ) and playing on their scooters ( right ) the girls go to nursery five days a week and their recent report card says they are ' getting on just fine ' the girls only had a small chance of survival as few as five per cent of conjoined twins ' births actually survive being born occasionally @entity4 and @entity25 , who attend nursery five days a week , have to have routine operations , but even those minor setbacks are n't stopping their development			1
mrs @entity29 said : ' they 've both developed as any " normal " child does			1
we were always a bit worried that them being conjoined could delay that , but it does n't seem to have done			2
' their report card from nursery says they are getting on just fine			0
the only problem we have is that @entity4 and @entity25 keep doubling up on their big sister @entity24 so they can steal her toys			1
' birth : @entity4 ( left ) and @entity25 ( right ) were delivered at 34 weeks and weighed 5lb 3oz each and the following day they were operated on to clear a life - threatening intestinal blockage celebrating their first year : @entity25 ( left ) and @entity4 ( right ) are pictured on their first birthday in july 2013 today : @entity4 ( left ) and @entity25 ( right ) are fit and healthy two - year - olds and love to double up on their big sister conjoined twins are two children physically connected to each other at some point in their bodies			1
the lowest odds of this happening are 200,000 to one for every live birth and around 70 percent of conjoined twins are female			1
conjoined twins are always the same sex and the form of conjoined twinning refers directly to where they are joined			1
the most most frequent are horacopagus ( heart , liver , intestine ) , omphalopagus ( liver , biliary tree , intestine ) , pygopagus ( spine , rectum , genitourinary tract ) , ischiopagus ( pelvis , liver , intestine , genitourinary tract ) , and craniopagus ( brain , meninges )			0
( @entity198 ) experts think that conjoined twins come from a single egg that fails to separate			1
around 200 conjoined twins are born each year and around half die before their first birthday			1
@entity205 and @entity206 , ten , were born joined at the head , but their parents left them in their local hospital in @entity210 , @entity211 because they could not pay their medical expenses			2
for eight years the girls have eaten , played and slept in one room at @entity215 and have been cared for by nursing staff			2
they can not be separated			0
their doctor , dr @entity217 , a paediatric surgeon , is trying to find an international surgeon who specialises in neurology to perform the operation			2
he said : ' it has always been possible to operate on the girls because they both have individual brains			0
' the problem lies with the one main blood vessel they share so it does have its risks			0
' @entity229 and @entity230 caught the attention of the world when at the age of 29 they decided to have surgery to separate			2
the sister 's skulls were joined above the ear but each of their brains was intact			0
they were never able to look into one another 's face without the aid of a mirror			0
their dream was to walk out of @entity248 in @entity249 and walk in opposite directions			0
sadly they both died after their surgery			2
born in @entity254 in 1974 , they developed different personalities and made separate groups of friends			2
@entity230 was the stronger personality and was more talkative , while @entity229 was quieter			0
so when @entity230 said she was determined to become a lawyer , @entity229 had no choice but to study law with her			0
conjoined twins @entity262 and @entity264 caused quite a stir when they were born in @entity211 , with some people in their village worshipping them as divine incarnations			1
and while one doctor has said that it would be possible to separate the 12 - year - olds , who were born joined at the waist , the duo are determined to remain together			2
@entity264 said : ‘ we do n't wish to get separated			0
we will stay like this even when we grow old			0
we want to live as we are			0
’ the pair , who were born in a tiny village near @entity279 in central @entity211 , share two legs and four arms and work in tandem to get around			0
they have stunned doctors with their ability to wash , dress and feed themselves			0
a local doctor told the family they were both healthy but he could not separate them			2
they are believed to share the same stomach but have independent lungs , hearts and brains			0
with practice they have learned to do all their basic daily chores with minimal fuss , including showering , eating , getting dressed and combing each other 's hair			0
they are able to walk down the stairs of their simple split - level home and even run on all six limbs to play cricket and other games with neighboring children .			0

@entity4 and @entity5 were born sharing the same intestines in 2012
team of 15 doctors spent five hours separating them in emergency surgery
now almost three years on the identical twins are fit , healthy toddlers
mother @entity29 , 34 , said they 're still ' inseparable ' after operation
five per cent of conjoined twins survive birth so family prepared for worst
