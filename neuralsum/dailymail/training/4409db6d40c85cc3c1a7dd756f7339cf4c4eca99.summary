by @entity0 a young man who tried to take a selfie right next to the tracks while a huge locomotive passed by him has learned the hard way why it 's a bad idea			2
@entity7 received a well - deserved boot to his head from the train 's engineer who yelled at him as he motored past the foolish would - be photographer			1
uploading the video to @entity14 , @entity7 attempted to explain that he ' tried to take a selfie while a train passed a ' safe ' distance behind '			1
but conceded , ' i guess i was still too close and got kicked in the head			0
instead of saying ' @entity32 ! ' , or ' maybe i was too close to the train ' , @entity7 exclaims , ' wow ! i got kicked in the head ! i think i got that on film ! ' here it comes : the train appears in view as the young man no doubt is getting excited about his upcoming picture here comes trouble : the train 's engineer appears on the side of the train ready to kick the kid smack : the boot of the conductor connects cleanly with the young man follow - through : the train speeds past and the young man 's head feels the full force of the conductors boot but , before everyone holds this up as another example of the extreme lengths people will now go to for the perfect selfie , some have joked they see the hand at work of @entity65 's prankster in chief , @entity64			1

the @entity73 late - night host has a past history for viral internet pranks - during the @entity79 he managed to get a picture of a wolf roaming the athletes village to go viral			0
in fact it was a fake , but that did not stop multiple outlets running with the image			0
that really hurt : the young man feels his face after his kick			0

@entity7 was struck in the head by the engineer of a single locomotive *car* and uploaded the video to @entity14
