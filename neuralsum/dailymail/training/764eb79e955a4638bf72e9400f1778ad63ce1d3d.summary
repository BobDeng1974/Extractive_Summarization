you know how it goes : you ’re trying to talk to your grandchildren , but they ’re constantly checking their beeping phones			1
except you know only too well they ’re not			2
at home , over dinner , you want to catch up with your husband , but he ’s busy checking his emails on his @entity13			2
he says ‘ yes ’ every so often but , again , his attention is obviously elsewhere			2
part of you wonders who is messaging him so often			2
you feel a pang of mistrust ; maybe you do n’t even kiss him goodnight			2
for many of us , this behaviour is slowly becoming the new normal			2
but it should n’t : because technology is destroying real intimacy in our relationships			1
i have been studying the digital world as a senior researcher at the @entity40 since 1990 , but it was six years ago when i started to notice myself spending too long on my smartphone : hours online at night and constantly responding to it in the day , even when surrounded by friends			0
as the quality of our physical connections gets diluted over time , we adjust , expecting less			1
we forget what real romance is			1
i realised i was beginning to get addicted — and i was n’t the only one			0
so , i began studying the effects of our virtual lives on our physical relationships , and have since spoken to hundreds of couples whose partnerships have been threatened by their addiction to technology			1
for some , the cause is what i call ‘ wretched contentment ’ : spending evenings watching tv , all the while constantly checking phones without talking			1
it ’s pleasant , but it ’s not fulfilling			0
as the quality of our physical connections gets diluted over time , we adjust , expecting less			1
we forget what real romance is			1
and we forget that sending kisses by email ca n’t replace actual intimacy			1
studies the world over have proven the same			0
researchers at the @entity72 interviewed hundreds of @entity74 users aged between 18 and 82 , who believed their partner ’s @entity74 use increased conflict in their relationship			0
even children ignore their grandparents as they are hooked to their smartphones as the use of the site increased , the study found , so did their jealousy , leading to break - ups , cheating and divorce			1
the evidence is everywhere : the more we resort to digital intimacy , the less fluent our actual intimacy becomes			1
one couple ’s relationship suffered when they were both promoted , and spent every evening answering emails from work , even at 11pm			0
‘ at first , we were answering emails from the bedroom , ’ says @entity96			0
‘ which meant our sex life suffered			0
then , my husband started working from the study next door instead			1
when he started texting me goodnight , instead of walking to the bedroom , i knew i was no longer a priority			0
’ an @entity106 study of 24,000 married @entity108 couples found a direct , inverse link between use of social networking sites and marital satisfaction this distance breeds mistrust			1
partners worry who their loved one is talking to — often with good reason			0
and an @entity106 study of 24,000 married @entity108 couples found a direct , inverse link between use of social networking sites and marital satisfaction			1
the more couples read about others ’ exciting lives on social media , the more likely they were to view their own with disappointment and disdain			1
placing smartphones and tablets away from the bedroom and the places we eat is a big step in the right direction people can fall into ‘ text ’ arguments in ways they never would face - to - face			0
misunderstandings are all too easy when you ca n’t read someone ’s body language			0
and friendships are affected as we replace meet - ups with online communication			0
the more we get out of practice at being with other human beings , the scarier physical closeness becomes , chipping away at our happiness			1
we all need deep communication and we ’re not getting it			0
many children now @entity154 relatives more regularly , but visit them less			2
most grandparents would prefer a call and a visit			2
technology can be a beautiful way to keep in touch , but it should be an addition , not a replacement , to real relationships			1
placing smartphones and tablets away from the bedroom and the places we eat is a big step in the right direction			0
use a proper alarm clock , not your phone			0
when you are meeting friends put your phone on ‘ airplane mode ’ and allow at least 20 minutes of uninterrupted communication			0
when you text your partner saying ‘ i love you ’ , close your eyes , picture your partner and really feel that love			0
when you send someone an ‘ x ’ in a text , make sure you give them a kiss in real life when you get home			2
