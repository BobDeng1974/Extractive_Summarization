with @entity8 poised to join the @entity10 international in @entity11 , the 24 - year - old winger was paraded by the club yesterday after completing his season - long loan move from @entity15 side @entity14			1
@entity3 are now regrouping after a painful @entity17 exit to @entity18 on tuesday and , ahead of today ’s @entity20 draw , @entity1 vowed to not only give the club a much - needed morale boost but to force @entity23 to make him a long - term acquisition			1

‘ i will bring glory and victory to @entity3			1
‘ in my mind i wo n’t be here for only one season			0
i know i will make it big and stay with @entity3 for a long time			1
’ @entity1 becomes manager @entity23 ’s fifth summer signing following the arrivals of @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
@entity39 striker @entity8 should add to that list by signing a four - year deal today and sources in @entity43 last night suggested the @entity44 has agreed personal terms on a £ 2.2million move			0
@entity48 meantime remains the subject of interest from @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 although contrary to reports the @entity51 have not yet tabled a bid for the defender			0
@entity58 : @entity1 evades @entity59 of @entity60 at the @entity58 in @entity61 as he prepared for a campaign in @entity64 ’s secondary competition , @entity1 told @entity65 : ‘ i wanted @entity3 to be in the @entity17 but unfortunately they could n’t make it - that is part of the game			1
‘ we have the @entity20 to face and that is like the @entity17 , so we need to manage that			2
‘ it is my ambition to excite the @entity3 fans			2
i want to make it big here and help @entity3 be very successful			2
‘ the history of @entity3 boosts my morale and gives me even more motivation to do well			2
‘ the players who have passed through here also excite me			0
‘ i want to make history for my country and for the team because i am the first @entity10 to play for @entity3 and i have to set an example for the upcoming ones			1
i need to make history for the team , for my nation and for myself			0
’ @entity15 : @entity1 spent last year at @entity90 , but was in @entity43 for the five preceding years handed the no 32 jersey after a career that encompassed @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 in @entity43 before he moved to @entity15 last year , @entity1 believes his long and winding road to @entity4 has primed him for the challenge that awaits			1

‘ to be great you have to work hard and i ’m ready to do it			0
‘ i do n’t really know much about @entity103 football but i know a little about @entity3 because i have been watching @entity3 since i was young and i saw the amazing supporters they have here			2
and the kind of players that pass through here makes me feel and see that @entity3 is a great team to be at			0
‘ i ’m here to build my career up again like i was doing in @entity43 and to help the team			0
’ @entity3 will discover their @entity20 fate today and with @entity23 ’s men almost certainly in pot two they will be hoping to avoid holders @entity53 , @entity113 and @entity114 as top seeds			0
all eyes , however , will be on pot four where they could yet be drawn with @entity118 .			0
