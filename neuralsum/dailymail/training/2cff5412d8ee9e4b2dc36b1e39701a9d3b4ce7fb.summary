@entity1 striker @entity0 has opened the door to a shock @entity4 return — if he gets an emergency sos call from national team boss @entity7			1
the 34 - year - old retired from the international scene last august after scoring the last of his 18 goals for @entity4 in a 3 - 2 defeat to @entity12 at @entity13			1
despite @entity7 wanting @entity0 to stay on , the travelling from @entity14 , where he played for @entity16 , to @entity4 was largely behind the veteran forward ’s decision to call time on his @entity4 career after 69 caps			1
return ? @entity0 has opened the door on a shock return to the @entity4 national team finisher : the forward retired last august after moving to @entity16 in @entity14 now @entity0 is back at @entity27 and , while he has no plans to come out of international retirement for good , he revealed he would never let his country down if injuries and suspensions hit hard in the upcoming qualifying campaign for the @entity34 in @entity35 2016			1
‘ if a call came in a time of crisis , i would find it hard to say no because everyone knows what playing for my country meant to me , ’ said the striker			2
‘ i made that decision ( to retire ) purely on the travel from @entity46 for the games			1
@entity48 does n’t shut down like our own domestic league in @entity4 so i was maybe missing one or two games because of the travel and i wanted to be fair to myself , @entity4 and @entity46			1
‘ i ’m back home now and i have n’t thought about doing a u-turn or anything like that			2
but if that call was to ever come then i think everybody knows what my answer would be			2
but i wo n’t be making any calls myself			2
’ @entity0 also admits he would be delighted if the next generation of strikers — like @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 — can end @entity4 ’s 18 - year wait to appear at major finals			1
he said : ‘ if you look at the team at the moment , things are going fantastic and they have got a lot of players in that position coming through			1
‘ you ’ve got @entity76 , @entity77 and wee @entity78 who has just moved to @entity81 for big money ( £ 11million )			2
these lads are coming in and doing a great job			0
i believe we are moving under the right direction with the manager and i ’m happy to sit and watch the boys hopefully reach the @entity89			0
’ @entity1 manager @entity90 , meanwhile , admitted there was still room for improvement after his side ’s latest tour match , despite recording a 2 - 1 victory over @entity98 third - tier side @entity97			0
despite being pleased at his team ’s second - half performance , the @entity27 boss was left displeased by the lack of urgency his side showed before the break , going behind to a goal from @entity107 before second - half goals from @entity109 and @entity110 secured the win			1
monumental : @entity0 celebrates after scoring against @entity12 at @entity13 last august room for improvement : @entity1 boss @entity90 has taken his side on tour to the @entity98 @entity90 said : ‘ you could see in the second half we were a lot better but i thought up until then there was a lack of aggression in our play			1
i do n’t mean we should be running around kicking people			0
i just mean we should be attacking the ball , passing the ball quicker , dictating the tempo			0
‘ that was lacking in the first half but the second half was night and day			0
for me , the biggest difference in the second half was that @entity109 and @entity132 attacked the ball			0
it ’s not rocket science			0
our performance was better and that came from the centre backs setting the tone for the whole team			2
’ ahead of tonight ’s friendly against @entity140 in @entity141 , @entity90 has injury worries over winger @entity143 and defender @entity144 , who limped off with a tight hamstring			0
@entity0 and @entity146 also left @entity147 with minor knocks			1
@entity90 said : ‘ the top of @entity143 ’s knee has swollen up but it ’s coming down and he ’s getting ice treatment on it			0
i ’m just a bit concerned we ’re flying to @entity14 and that may keep the swelling up			0
‘ hopefully i ’ll try and get @entity143 involved again in @entity14 but we ’ll need to wait and see how he is			0
@entity144 ’s hamstring is tight and @entity0 and @entity146 took a couple of kicks			1

@entity0 may return to @entity4 team , if boss @entity7 wants him
