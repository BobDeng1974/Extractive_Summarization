by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 2 february 2013 updated : 18:41 est , 2 february 2013 elegance , to a tea : @entity3 charges thousands to teach manners to @entity6 women they buy more bentleys than the @entity9 , fill their luxury homes with more @entity11 than the @entity12 , and spend more on @entity13 and @entity14 than the @entity15 or the @entity16			1
but one precious commodity has eluded the @entity18 in their extraordinary rise from peasant nation to superpower : good manners			1
officials are so exasperated by the tendency to spit , shout , slurp and push in at queues that they have taken to pleading and cajoling			1
it is not long since @entity30 launched a ‘ @entity40 ’ campaign : no spitting , no littering , no vandalism , no damaging greenery , no jaywalking , no smoking in public places and no swearing			0
it was a dismal failure			0
during the @entity44 , a squad of 1,500 supervisors was sent out to discourage fighting at bus stops			0
paper bags were handed out by volunteers in uniforms emblazoned with the @entity18 characters for mucus			1
but when a @entity6 university set up a ‘ civic index ’ to calculate the level of politeness , researchers concluded glumly that the city was still a long way off international norms and the index was quietly dropped			1
now , however , a school of etiquette is about to open in @entity6 with classes based on the deportment of the @entity9 aristocracy – and the decorous behaviour of the @entity66			1
@entity3 , a @entity67 businesswoman who grew up in @entity68 , is offering lessons in being classy to an exclusive clientele for an appropriately princely sum : courses at her @entity73 , based in the five - star @entity74 in @entity6 , cost from £ 2,000 to £ 10,000			1
dozens of society wives have signed up for lectures on how to use a knife and fork properly , how to peel a piece of fruit , how to greet a prospective mother - in - law , how to walk in heels and how to eat soup without slurping			1
high - powered bosses of @entity18 state - owned companies are also hiring @entity3 for lessons on how to conduct themselves at business meetings in @entity91 and @entity92			1
she says a subtle @entity94 snobbery is driving the desire of wealthy @entity18 to improve themselves socially : ‘ there is an aura of mystery about @entity91 royalty that @entity18 people ca n’t resist			1
any aristocracy in @entity18 was wiped out , so the @entity18 are fascinated by the idea of a royal dynasty that stretches back hundreds of years			1
’ @entity3 plans to show her students pictures and videos of @entity66 – someone who , like @entity18 itself , rose from a relatively humble background to take her place at the top table			1
she says : ‘ @entity66 is probably the most followed @entity116 in @entity18			1
she is very elegant , very classy			0
even though she is not from an aristocratic family , she carries herself very well and i think she is a role model for the younger generation around the world			0
‘ all my students will know who she is			0
it is very demanding to be a role model and to have everybody watch your every move , but she has carried it off with so much class and patience			0
she seems to exude kindness and etiquette awareness and care for others			2
the @entity131 adore her as well , do n’t they ? ’ culture clash : @entity3 teaches table manners at her etiquette school in a five - star hotel in @entity6 where students pay £ 2,000 - £ 10,000 to learn how to present themselves the @entity9 way clear instructions : a ' no spitting ' sign at a textile factory in @entity141 sipping elegantly from a bowl of vegetable soup in a trendy @entity6 restaurant , @entity3 , a 27 - year - old graduate of @entity142 , says @entity18 misplaced its manners during @entity148 ’s @entity147			1
her own family fled and then made its fortune in @entity67			2
in her plummy @entity9 accent , she says : ‘ i am @entity18 and very proud of my country			1
i do n’t think the vast majority of @entity18 people are purposely offensive			2
they just have n’t been enlightened to etiquette awareness			2
‘ the @entity147 wiped a lot of that away			0
when you are pushing to the front of the food ration line just to get that last bit of rice to feed your family , you do n’t have the luxury to think about etiquette			2
you are just trying to survive			0
’ she is hoping to invite @entity9 aristocrats to lecture her students and even has plans to lead classes on a @entity172 , taking in the opera houses and art galleries of @entity91 to complete their education			2
model behaviour : @entity177 , @entity66 , is the inspiration for many young , high society @entity18 women converting @entity6 ’s nouveau riche will be no small task			1
at an introductory lesson , female students drove up in a convoy of @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 , then emerged in a maelstrom of fur and diamonds			0
their nails were so ornate they had difficulty handling the cutlery			0
‘ in @entity67 and @entity68 , it is all about subtlety , ’ explains @entity3			1
‘ in @entity6 , i will go out for lunch with a girlfriend and she will have a big @entity200 ring that you open up and it ’s a lip balm			2
when i go out to socialite events in @entity6 and i put on minimal make - up , they say , “ @entity203 , you did n’t put make - up on today			2
are you feeling ok ? ” ’ multi-millionaire ’s wife @entity208 , one of her new students , says the shocking manners of her fellow countrymen have almost driven her abroad			0
‘ i simply ca n’t abide people who pick their noses , spit and talk too loudly , ’ complains the glamorous 30 - year - old @entity6 socialite			1
@entity208 , whose husband heads one of @entity18 ’s biggest auction houses and has a family income equivalent to £ 1 million a month , is an eye - catching regular in the society columns of @entity18 ’s glossy magazines			1
she adds : ‘ some people behave like barbarians			0
they eat and drink loudly and take phone calls in the middle of dinner or at a movie			0
there are so many wealthy people in @entity18 but they have no manners			1
i often think about migrating to another country because of it			0
’ @entity208 will pay between £ 5,000 and £ 6,000 for her course and says she is already amazed at what she has learned from two introductory sessions , adding : ‘ we were taught how to shake hands , and how you should always have eye contact when you ’re talking to people			0
before the course , i did n’t know how to wipe my mouth properly with a napkin or how to fold it before placing it in my lap – or even how to tear a piece of bread and put butter on it			0
’ she pauses , then adds with a shudder : ‘ it ’s only now that i realise how terribly rude i must have seemed			0
’ @entity18 ’s lack of manners has become something of a national embarrassment , with academics openly debating in the state - run media how habits can be changed			1
certainly , public behaviour can come as a shock to @entity262			0
on one of my first visits in 2004 , i learned not to put my head out of a bus window			0
when i did so , a man three rows ahead spat expertly and copiously out of the window and scored a direct hit on me			0
it is not uncommon to see people blowing their noses without a handkerchief			0
my translator told me , however , that many @entity18 believe phlegm is toxic and that spitting it out expels poison from the body			2
to them , she said , our habit of blowing our noses into a handkerchief and putting it in our pockets is just as repugnant			0
@entity3 hopes that the perfect manners she is teaching will trickle down to the rest of @entity18 society : a new form of cultural revolution			1
‘ when i say i ’m starting an etiquette school the first thing people say to me is , “ thank you			2
@entity18 needs this , ” ’ she says .			2

it is still *acceptable* behaviour in @entity18 to spit on the street , blow your nose in your hand , slurp your soup and *unashamedly* push ahead in a queue
@entity67 born @entity3 was brought up in @entity68 and has *imported* @entity9 manners to @entity6 with her school of etiquette
ms @entity3 charges up to £ 10,000 to improve manners in @entity18 *'s* high society
