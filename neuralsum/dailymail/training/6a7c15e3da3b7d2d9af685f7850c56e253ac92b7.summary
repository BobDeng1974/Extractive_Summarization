by @entity0 published : 17:10 est , 15 october 2013 updated : 04:51 est , 16 october 2013 the price of a first class stamp will jump higher over the next three years the price of a first class stamp , which has rocketed to 60p , will jump higher over the next three years it emerged last night			1
according to details buried in the @entity8 ’s prospectus , the newly privatised company still plans further price rises			2
this is despite the fact it admits the ‘ substantial ’ price increase from 46p to 60p in april 2012 did trigger a drop in the number of letters sent			1
the price shock comes after strict rules – which used to control @entity8 ’s ability to increase prices – were scrapped before the stock market float			1
the move was one of many changes , which also included allowing the company to dump a £ 12billion pension black hole on the taxpayer , that were made to prepare @entity8 for a sell - off			0
as a result there is now no official limit on how much the former state monopoly can raise stamp prices , or a cap on how many times they can be increased each year			0
the only protection around stamps is the price of a second - class stamp , which costs 50p			2
under rules , laid down by the regulator @entity42 , the maximum price which @entity8 can charge for a second - class stamp is currently 56p			1
in its prospectus , @entity8 said directors ‘ expect any price increase to be broadly in line with @entity46 over the three financial years ended in 2016 ’			1
@entity46 is the retail prices index measure of inflation , typically higher than the more commonly used consumer prices index			0
for example figures published yesterday by the @entity52 show @entity46 is 3.2 per cent , but @entity53 is only 2.7 per cent			0
official forecasts , from the independent watchdog the @entity55 , show @entity46 is predicted to be 2.8 per cent in 2014 , 3.2 per cent in 2015 and 3.6 per cent in 2016			0
if correct , the price of a first - class stamp could hit 66p over the next three years			1
@entity8 chief executive @entity58 said the company has to be ‘ very careful about pricing ’			0
the price shock comes after strict rules were scrapped before the stock market float she added : ‘ i do n’t think you ’re going to see a company that is going to be senseless about the pricing lever			1
’ miss @entity58 said @entity68 is in the ‘ low to middle of the spectrum ’ compared to stamp prices in the rest of the @entity72 and insisted @entity8 must ‘ retain the loyalty of our customer base ’			2
yesterday the @entity76 said stamps are ‘ really good value ’ but it would ‘ not be happy ’ to see large increases			0
last year ’s price hike caused such furore that @entity8 agreed to allow millions on benefits to buy stamps at the old price last @entity85			0
in another bid to pacify concerns , @entity8 did not increase stamp prices in april this year .			2

price of a first class stamp will rise again over the next three years
@entity8 admits ' substantial ' price increase to 60p in april 2012
*decision* comes as rules which controlled price hikes were scrapped before the stock market float
