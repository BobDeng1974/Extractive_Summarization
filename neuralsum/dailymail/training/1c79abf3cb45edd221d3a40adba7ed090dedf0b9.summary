as the @entity3 sews together a patchwork of agency responses to the @entity7 epidemic , sen. @entity0 and other @entity2 lawmakers are demanding that president @entity8 appoint a single ' ebola czar ' to oversee the government 's efforts to contain the virus			1
' from spending time here in @entity13 , my constituents are not comforted , ' @entity0 , an @entity13 @entity2 , said sunday on @entity18			1
' there has to be more reassurance given to them			0
i would say we do n't know exactly who 's in charge			2
there has to be some kind of czar			0
' that represents a 180 - degree turn from @entity0 's view in 2009 , when he lambasted the administration for taking a ' czar ' approach to everything from drugs and green jobs to the @entity36 and @entity38 's water supply			1
' @entity8 has more czars than the @entity41 – who ruled @entity43 for 3 centuries , ' he tweeted during @entity8 's first year in office			1
' @entity41 18 , cyberczar makes 20			2
@entity8 took a sunday conference call with @entity51 secretary @entity50 , who moved over from the @entity3 budget director post in june and is seen as three - parts administrator , zero - parts public health expert			1
on monday he will meet with ' senior members of his administration , ' according to the @entity3 , ' to receive an update on the @entity88 ’s response to the @entity7 case in @entity90 and broader efforts to ensure the preparedness of our national health infrastructure			1
' he last convened that group a week ago			0
@entity3 press secretary @entity96 told reporters on oct. 6 that homeland security adviser @entity98 is ' the point person here at the @entity3 who is coordinating the interagency response to this effort			1
' ' but again , ' he said in his next breath , ' it ’s @entity74 that is the point on the ground			0
' the @entity76 , @entity96 added , is in charge of ' logistical infrastructure ' in @entity108			0
and ' @entity51 and the @entity54 are the lead in communicating with state and local officials and with public health officials in states all across the country			0
' reporters covering the @entity3 can find it challenging to get answers			2
members of @entity56 , rep. @entity117 suggested saturday , are in the same boat as constituents pepper them with questions in the final few weeks before @entity122			1
@entity123 's not the czar : @entity8 faces tough questions about how he 's cobbling together an @entity7 response without a single point - person to answer questions and move the ball forward @entity0 was n't always a fan of naming ' czars ' – point - people – to consolidate the government 's responses to a crisis talk soup : ( left to right ) @entity138 commander gen. @entity137 , homeland security adviser @entity98 , @entity74 administrator @entity139 , @entity141 director dr. @entity140 and @entity51 secretary @entity50 all took their turns at the microphone on october 3 speaking to the @entity144 , he said that while he ' hate [ s ] to invoke the term " czar " , ' @entity8 needs a ' central office that ’s a clearinghouse ' helmed by ' a command and control general , a strategic guy			1
' @entity117 doubled down in an interview with @entity151 in @entity152 , saying that ' they need to have one person in charge , because you have about seven different federal agencies that are involved in this			1
we need to have a schematic saying who 's responsible			0
' ' @entity163 ' positions at @entity3 are generally created inside the @entity3 and given to unelected bureaucrats who do n't report to cabinet agencies			2
that situation has historically made members of @entity56 uneasy and brought howls from whichever party is out of power			2
@entity117 himself tried to defund all of @entity8 's czars in 2009 with a bill that gathered 123 so - cosponsors – all @entity2 – when @entity175 controlled both houses of @entity56			1
the legislation died in committee			0
the one federal government agency that might logically weigh in on @entity7 – but has n't – is the @entity180			0
@entity8 nominated dr. @entity182 to fill it a year ago , but his statements in favor of doctors inquiring into their patients ' gun ownership proved too toxic			2
still , rear admiral @entity189 is that acting surgeon general , and he 's been silent			0
@entity190 ? rear adm. @entity189 ( left ) , the acting @entity66 surgeon general , has focused on preventative public health like anti-obesity measures more than disease response efforts who 's in charge ? leaders of 10 separate government agencies gathered to brief the president on oct. 6 three other potential @entity7 czars identified by @entity202 senator @entity201 and @entity204 rep. @entity203 , both @entity2 , would all come from outside the @entity8 administration			1
in an oct. 6 letter to the president , the two lawmakers suggested former secretary of state @entity209 , former secretary of defense @entity210 or and secretary of health and human services @entity212			0
all three served under president @entity213			0
' this requires a global response and the @entity66 needs to provide the necessary leadership to control and eliminate this outbreak , ' @entity214 and @entity203 wrote			0
' we believe it is imperative that you designate a single senior advisor who will be responsible for coordination all @entity66 agencies and policies involving the international and domestic response to @entity7			2

@entity3 has had a rotating *cavalcade* of experts from seven different agencies briefing @entity56 and the press on @entity7
sen. @entity0 said on sunday that he would ' like to know who 's in charge ' of the @entity3 's plan
but during @entity8 's first year in office , he *mocked* the president for having ' more czars than the @entity41 '
rep. @entity117 demanded ' one person in charge ' on saturday to lead ' one central office that 's a clearinghouse '
in 2009 he pushed legislation to defund @entity3 ' czars ' as *unaccountable* *apparatchiks*
