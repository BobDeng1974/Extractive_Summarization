by @entity0 and mail online reporter a @entity3 foster father who mistakenly left a 10 - month - old baby girl to die in his hot car has been charged with first - degree murder			1
@entity8 's lawyer said that the felony charge was far too strict for his client , who only remembered the baby was inside the car two hours later when something on tv jogged his memory			1
' rather high for a mistake , ' attorney @entity16 told @entity18 of the murder charge , which carries a life sentence with a minimum of 20 years in prison			1
' i 'm not trying to say it 's not a horrible loss			0
the death of a child is an awful thing			0
but this person is looking at 15 more years than someone who was driving drunk and ran into a car and killed someone			2
he knows he made a mistake and he accepts responsibility for the mistake			2
he knows because of his actions , @entity44 is dead			0
' but @entity47 district attorney @entity46 said the charge was warranted because the child died because of an inherently dangerous felony , aggravated endangering of a child			2
@entity8 , 29 , was arrested after he found the baby - known as @entity54 to the new family and @entity44 to her biological relatives - inside his silver @entity57 and called emergency services			1
@entity44 was being cared for by @entity8 and his partner @entity35 , 26 , who are parents to two adopted boys , aged five and seven			1
they had cared for the girl for most of her life			2
devastated : @entity8 's mother is pictured with little @entity44 - known to the foster family as @entity54 loving : the couple have two adopted sons and three foster children			1
they had been trying to adopt @entity54 @entity8 had collected her from daycare last thursday but left her in the car with the windows rolled up as he went inside his home with his five - year - old son - as temperatures reached 95 degrees			1
when he ran outside to get the girl , he found he unresponsive			2
emergency dispatchers got a call at 6.41pm , and the girl was pronounced dead a few minutes later			2
@entity8 's mother one of the foster parents was ' hysterically crying ' outside the house before they were both taken in by police for questioning , witnesses said			1
@entity8 and his partner had been trying to adopt the 10 - month - old girl they had cared for nearly all her life			1
they also had three other foster children , ages three , five and 18 ; and had two adopted children , ages five and seven			1
the two younger foster children were visiting other relatives at the time			1
police have said both foster parents were distraught over what happened			0
tragic : the girl had been inside this @entity57 for more than two hours before she was found shocked : neighbors hug in disbelief near the parked car where a 10 - month - old @entity106 girl died @entity8 's mother @entity107 told @entity18 that she spoke to her son at 2am friday			1
' he wants to die , ' she said			0
' @entity8 's children - that 's his life			1
' the little girl 's biological grandmother @entity112 , drove to @entity106 to try and discover how the tragedy had occurred			0
we do n't know if it was accident , ' she told @entity18 station @entity119			0
' they have a lot of kids they take care of			0
' the couple 's adoptive children were taken into protective custody			0
a neighbor said the men were devoted parents			0
' they are two of the most kind - hearted guys that i have ever met			0
and i hate that there 's so much controversy right now with babies being left in the car , because i truly do n't feel from the bottom of my heart they would ever do this on purpose , ' @entity135 , who lives across the street , told @entity18			2
devastated : @entity8 's mother @entity107 said that her son ' wants to die ' after the unimaginable tragedy distraught : the girl 's biological grandmother , @entity112 , said she wants to hold her one last time both the prosecution and the defense agree the circumstances are entirely different than a widely publicized case in @entity156 , where a father is charged with murder and child cruelty charges on suspicion of intentionally leaving the 22 - month - old boy in a hot car last month as he went to work			1
@entity46 said this @entity3 case is not charged as an intentional murder			0
' no one is alleging , it is not charged that he did this intentionally , ' @entity46 said of the @entity3 case			0
' we are not intimating , as authorities in @entity156 have , there was some plot or anything like that			0
it is a different charging theory and a different charging authority in @entity3 than what appears to be in @entity156			0
' @entity8 ' partner , @entity35 , has not been charged			1
he was already home when @entity8 came in and assumed he 'd brought the baby in , according to police reports			1
like an oven : after just 60 minutes , temperatures inside a car left out in 90 - degree heat can feel like more than 130 degrees			2
it was around 90 degrees outside in @entity106 when baby @entity44 was left behind			0

@entity8 , 29 , forgot about @entity186 after getting home last thursday and only remembered when something on tv jogged his memory
@entity8 had picked up the little girl from *babysitter* but left her *strapped* to car seat with the windows rolled up - killing her
@entity8 and his partner , who have three other foster children and two adopted children , were trying to adopt the little girl
his lawyer has said that the murder charge is ' rather high for a mistake '
