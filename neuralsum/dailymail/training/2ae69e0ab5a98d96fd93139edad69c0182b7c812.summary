by @entity0 follow @ @ charliefscott @entity1 believes new signing @entity2 will be a perfect fit at @entity5 following his move from @entity7			1
@entity2 completed his £ 27million switch shortly before the @entity9 kicked off in @entity10 , where his team @entity12 crashed out in the group stage			1
