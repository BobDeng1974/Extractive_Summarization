a man underwent surgery to have 50 maggots removed from his nose before they destroyed his face and killed him			1
the painstaking operation to remove the creatures - which had buried deep inside his sinuses - took two hours , doctors said			1
the man was suffering from nasal myasis – where the nose and sinuses become infested with the larvae of flies			1
he was suffering from nasal myasis , where flies lay their eggs in or around a nose and then hatch into maggots which feed off human flesh a surgeon removed the writhing maggots one by one			1
if left untreated , they could chew through the flesh and bones of the face and eyes , possibly causing an infection such as meningitis and even death flies lay their eggs in or around a person ’s nose , and they hatch into maggots			1
the maggots , which are around a centimetre in length , feed off human flesh			2
if left untreated , they can chew and destroy the bones and soft tissues of the face , nose and eyes			1
this can lead to infection in the eyes and brain , and occasionally causing meningitis and even death			1
dr @entity54 , who carried out the operation was able to see into the man 's nose using an endoscope			1
this is a thin , flexible tube that has a light and a camera on the end			2
he uploaded the video from the endoscope ’s camera to @entity68 afterwards , showing the inside of the man ’s nose before and after the procedure			1
it shows the white maggots packed into the nasal cavity , sometimes burrowing deep into the nasal tissue			0
as they had burrowed so deep , the procedure took two hours to remove them all			2
the maggots were buried deep into the man 's nasal cavities and sinuses			2
when the light shined on them they burrowed deeper from view at the end of the video , a metal bowl is seen filled with the squirming maggots amid pieces of bloody nasal tissue			0
dr @entity54 said he has seen only six to eight cases of nasal maggots in 15 years of his @entity97 ( @entity97 ) practice			0
he added that the man completely recovered from the disease afterwards			1
nasal myasis is common in tropical countries such as @entity102			2
it usually occurs in people who have poor hygiene and nutrition , or alcoholics			0
it also occurs in people who have a disease of the nose called @entity111 , which produces foul smelling discharge which attracts the flies			0
around 50 maggots were collected in a metal bowl at the end of the procedure			1
they were mixed up with bloody pieces of nasal tissue people with the condition may not be aware they have maggots in the nose , but they will usually experience irritation , sneezing , tears and a headache			2
thin blood - stained discharge often oozes from the nostrils and the eyelids and lips become puffy			0
usually the maggots are killed using chloroform water and oil , and warm saline water is used to flush out the dead maggots			0
surgery to remove the creatures is performed in extreme cases			2
doctors advise that a patient with maggots should covered with a mosquito net to avoid contact with flies , which could lead to further infestation			0
parents in @entity148 in the @entity149 are being warned that their children could succumb to horrifying infestations of nasal maggots worming in their noses if they continue snorting @entity155 sweets			0
the unusual trend seeks to imitate cocaine users seen on television			0
but doctors are warning the bizarre trend can lead to a condition called nasal myiasis - which occurs when flies lay larvae eggs inside the nose			1
they are attracted by the rotting debris of the sweets stick inside the nasal lining			0
according to officials in @entity171 , @entity148 , the trend is a ' widespread phenomenon ' that has been sweeping @entity68 in recent years and has involved over a dozen students in the area			0
parents have been warned to watch their children to see if they develop a tickling sensation inside their noses and ask them if they begin to smell a foul stench from inside their nasal passage .			0
