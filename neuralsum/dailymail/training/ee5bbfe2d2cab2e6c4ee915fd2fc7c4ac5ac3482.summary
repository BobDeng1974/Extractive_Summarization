the terrifying moment an avalanche thunders down a mountainside has been captured by brave photographers at @entity4 , near @entity5 in @entity6			1
incredible images reveal the snow crashing down the mountain at more than 50mph ( 80km/h ) as scientists watch from a hut close to the avalanche 's path			1
the full - scale avalanche was triggered by scientists using explosives as part of an experiment to help them understand and model avalanche motion			1
meanwhile , photographers took pictures so that they could compare it with the seismic data to estimate the size of future events			1
another key measurement is snow temperature , and researchers collected data on this before , during and after the avalanche			1
scientists are hoping to learn more about how avalanches form			1
they believe the most deadly type of avalanche , dubbed a ' slab avalanche , ' forms when an area of snow shatters and slides off the mountainside			2

loud noises are n't the main culprit			0
instead , these avalanches tend to take place when snow builds up quickly , and weight is suddenly put on it			2
when this happens , a weak area below the snow causes a slab to break off			0
loud noises are n't the main culprit in this type of avalanche			2
instead , these avalanches tend to take place when snow builds up quickly , and weight is suddenly placed on the fresh snow			2
when this happens , a weak area below the snow causes a slab to break off			0
it is estimated that around 90 per cent of avalanche accidents involving people are triggered by the weight victim or someone with the victim			1
the largest avalanches form from powder snow			2
they create turbulent currents that consist of a powder cloud , which overlies a dense avalanche			0
they can exceed speeds of 186 mph ( 300 km / h ) , and masses of 10,000,000 tonnes			0
the study of avalanches can be dangerous in itself			0
last month , a @entity109 woman who studied the science of snow died after falling victim to the very thing she found so fascinating			0
a small slide hit backcountry skier @entity115 of @entity116 and she later died at a hospital			0
ms @entity115 was studying geography , focusing on snow science , at @entity120 in @entity121 and had been an intern at the @entity123			0
she was on the @entity125 avalanche path , also known as the arcade path , of @entity127 near @entity128 , @entity109 when the tragedy struck			0

pictured is an artificially created avalanche in @entity6 scientists set up laser measurement and imaging equipment before triggering an avalanche at the @entity4 in @entity142 near @entity5 the test took place at @entity4 in @entity142 near @entity5			1
@entity142 is a small village in the canton of @entity147 , @entity6 , located in the municipality of @entity149			1

the full - scale avalanche in @entity4 , near @entity5 in @entity6 , was triggered using explosives
researchers at the @entity24 hope the data will help them forecast future avalanches
they used seismic , temperature and motion sensors to gather information about its speed and formation
