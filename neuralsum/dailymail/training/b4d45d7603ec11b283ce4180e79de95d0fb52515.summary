by @entity0 and @entity1 the only @entity2 that fought in the @entity3 and is still flying today is up for sale for £ 2.5 million – more than 30 years after it was found as scrap in @entity6			1
the aircraft , which regularly takes part in flypasts , was restored by a vintage car buff who discovered the wreck by chance while seeking old @entity14			1
but retired businessman @entity15 is now selling the 1940 @entity16 1 through an @entity18 dealer , fuelling fears that it could be lost to @entity20			1
hurricanes , alongside @entity28 , were at the centre of the country ’s heroic defence of the skies in 1940 and had a crucial role until the end of the war , but the vast majority were then scrapped			0
mr @entity15 , 72 , said : ‘ this @entity2 is a one - off			1
there is no other @entity20 plane like it from the @entity3 that is flying today			1
it was a labour of love to recover and restore it and i have enjoyed watching it fly for the past ten years			0
heroic : wing commander @entity45 , who was responsible for three of the plane ’s five ‘ kills ’ in the @entity3 died last month aged 94 ‘ however , it is time for somebody else to take it on – and my hope is that it will stay in the @entity20 or in @entity52			1
obviously , there is a possibility that it could go further afield			0
but it is such an iconic @entity20 plane			2
the sight and sound of it is the @entity3			2
the public absolutely love it			0
’ the former printer spotted the aircraft ’s rotting hulk in 1982 on a visit to a university at @entity63 , north - east @entity6 , but did not immediately realise what it was			2
the plane had been given to engineering students in 1947 after the war in the @entity69 came to an end			0
the fuselage was lying in a compound with the propeller , wings and tailplane spread out over the ground			0
mr @entity15 , of @entity77 , @entity78 , said : ‘ it looked like a pile of junk , but once i had found out what it was , i became obsessed with restoring it			1
’ he returned to @entity6 in 1996 and , after a long battle with local bureaucrats , bought the fighter for £ 25,000 in 2001 and shipped it to @entity20			1
it took four years and 32,000 hours of restoration work , including renovating a @entity92 engine , before the @entity2 was once again airworthy			1
it has since flown in public more than 100 times			0
wing commander @entity45 , who was responsible for three of the plane ’s five ‘ kills ’ in the @entity3 , died last month aged 94			2
a spokesman for the @entity98 said : ‘ it would be disappointing if @entity45 ’s @entity2 were to leave the country			0
it is very special and it would be a shame if it could no longer be seen over the @entity20			2
’ the aircraft is being offered for sale through @entity105			0
final fighter : online ad for the @entity2 flown by @entity45 , right , that 's still in flying condition			0
