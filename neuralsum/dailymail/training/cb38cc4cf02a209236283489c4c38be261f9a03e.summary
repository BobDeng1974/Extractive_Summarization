by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:40 est , 20 september 2012 updated : 02:47 est , 21 september 2012 female soldiers should face compulsory pregnancy tests before deploying to @entity4 , say military chiefs			1
commanders said it was ‘ unacceptable ’ that service personnel should be placed at risk of @entity11 attack while evacuating pregnant women from the front line			1
the strong reaction came after the @entity15 revealed a @entity17 soldier had given birth to a son in @entity20			1
sisters in arms : women soldiers in training - hundreds are fighting the @entity11 the junior non-commissioned officer in the @entity26 had a healthy boy five weeks prematurely on tuesday			2
both mother and child are doing well			2
the woman – the first @entity17 soldier to have a baby on the battlefield – had been unaware she was pregnant			1
the birth astonished military chiefs			1
strict military rules already ban pregnant women from deploying on operations and troops are repeatedly reminded by top brass to check they are not before they fly to the front line			1
but servicewomen are not forced to take a urine test before deploying because top brass consider it would be an ‘ invasion of privacy ’			2
colonel @entity43 , who commanded @entity17 troops in @entity4 , said : ‘ this soldier was extremely lucky to have given birth in @entity20 where there are excellent medical facilities			1
‘ but if she had been out on patrol or in a forward operating base the outcome might have been tragically different – resulting in harm to mother and child			2
‘ if she had to be evacuated from a forward position then her fellow soldiers might have had to carry her and her equipment over long distances in sweltering heat and under @entity11 attack			2
‘ aircrew and helicopters could have been endangered if she had to be flown out in hazardous circumstances			2
‘ these added dangers are clearly acceptable as a result of unpredictable injury or medical condition			2
but they are not acceptable in these circumstances			2
‘ for these reasons there should be compulsory pregnancy testing prior to any operational deployment			2
’ the @entity75 - born mother , a gunner who helped provide covering fire for troops in combat , had been deployed with the 12th @entity79 since march			1
two days ago she complained of severe stomach pains			2
to her amazement , medics told her that she was about to give birth			1
@entity20 , @entity4 : a @entity75 woman soldier stationed at the @entity17 base in @entity86 gave birth on tuesday			1
the super fit squaddie did not even realise she was pregnant unexpected task : the soldier , who has not been named , was taken to @entity20 's £ 10million field hospital where @entity92 medics delivered her baby she was thought to be in about the 34th week of her pregnancy – meaning she conceived before flying to @entity4 for her six - month tour of duty			1
she was taken to @entity20 ’s £ 10million state - of - the - art field hospital			1
its staff are world leaders in treating injuries from bomb blasts and gunshot wounds , but do not have specialist midwifery or paediatric skills			0
a midwife and neo-natal nurse from the @entity108 , @entity105 are travelling to the @entity17 base in @entity86 with an incubator to provide care for the soldier and her son on the flight home			1
the cost is not being disclosed			0
major general @entity116 , the ex-commanding officer of @entity117 and a @entity119 land commander , said : ‘ i would have thought insisting on compulsory pregnancy tests would make sense			0
’ but the @entity122 dismissed the risk			1
a spokesman said : ‘ there are a huge number of medical circumstances that could be faced			0
aircraft and vehicles are on standby to respond to them			0
‘ troops are prepared for a whole host of different missions			1
' there is no extra cost and travelling anywhere in a warzone has its own dangers			0
' less than 1 per cent of all servicewomen who have deployed on operations since 2006 have had to return from @entity4 due to pregnancy			0
' only one has ever given birth			1
the health and safety of our troops is always our top priority			1
’ soldiers heading for @entity4 undergo stringent medical checks to make sure they can cope with the rigours of combat – but not pregnancy tests			0
servicemen and women take part in pre-deployment training for about six months before they fly to the war zone			0
it includes arduous physical tests , such as an eight - mile march carrying a 40lb backpack , press - ups , sit - ups and a 1.5 - mile run against the clock			0
then there are a number of routine medical examinations depending on their roles , including hearing , eyesight and dental checks , and tests of body mass index			0
they also have blood pressure , heart rate and lung capacity monitored and recorded			0
‘ we need to know people are fit enough to leg it to a helicopter , for instance , if there is an attack , ’ said a @entity122 spokesman			0
personnel are also given any vaccinations they need to ward off tropical diseases and a course of anti-malaria tablets			0
female soldiers are asked whether they are – or suspect they are – pregnant			0
this is routine so medical staff can ensure the inoculation does not damage an unborn baby			0
if they answer ‘ yes ’ , then they will not be allowed to deploy			0
but if the response is ‘ no ’ , it serves to remind sexually active servicewomen that it might be wise to take a pregnancy test			0
pre-deployment guidelines and advice issued to every soldier make clear that women troops should not deploy if they are pregnant but at no time are women given a pregnancy test by the @entity122 @entity212 , chief executive of the @entity213 , said it was unusual for a woman not to know she was pregnant until the last minute			1
but she said that symptoms might be overlooked under stressful circumstances such as a tour of duty in @entity4			0
‘ if you do n’t expect to be pregnant , are busy and stressful or in a life - or - death situation , you may be so focused on what is happening in your life that you do n’t spot or put to the back of your mind the signs of pregnancy you may be experiencing			1
’ pregnancy tests can be bought from high street chemists for less than £ 10 and can give a result as soon as seven days after conception			0
because troops are not used to the conditions of deployment , including different diet , extreme heat or cold and sporadic working hours , many soldiers put physical changes down their environment .			1
