@entity1 dictator @entity0 is continuing to use chemical weapons on his own civilians , according to the results of tests carried out at the sites of suspected gas attacks			1
the claim was made after samples were taken from the ground by trained professionals near the spot where three suspected attacks took place in the war - torn country			2
a weapons expert has now analysed the soil samples which have shown traces of chlorine and ammonia - both of which can be used in the production of chemical weapons - at all three sites			1
@entity1 opposition activists and claim government forces have attacked rebel - held areas with poisonous chlorine gas in recent months it comes on yet another day of violence in the country in which two car bombs exploded in a pro-government neighbourhood in the central city of @entity45 - blasts which state officials say killed at least 40 people			1
state media claims that mortar strikes that happened just hours earlier in the heart of the capital @entity32 killed a further 14 , though figures vary the latest chemical weapons claim was made as the global watchdog overseeing the destruction of @entity1 ’s toxic stockpile prepares to send a fact - finding mission to @entity1 to investigate allegations by rebels and activists of chlorine gas attacks			1
the @entity63 - based @entity62 ( @entity62 ) said president @entity0 's government had agreed to accept the mission and had promised to provide security in areas under its control			2
but speaking to the @entity70 , @entity71 , a @entity73 chemical weapons expert involved in the recent soil sample testing , said : ‘ we have unequivocally proved that the regime has used chlorine and ammonia against its own civilians in the last two to three weeks			1
‘ in each of the samples we have found evidence of chlorine			2

research has been carried out by a weapons expert on soil samples taken from other suspected attack sites ‘ also , the samples indicate that ammonia has also been used in @entity95			1
’ the samples are said to have been collected from attacks that happened on april 11 , 18 and 21 from people who were trained up especially for the task			0
@entity0 and his regime has once again denied claims that it used chemical weapons calling it a ‘ baseless allegation ’			1
but @entity70 , who asked for the tests to be carried out , reports that some of the toxins came from barrels that were dropped from helicopters in the province of @entity113 , where there are reported to have been eight separate chemical attacks on rebel held communities in just two weeks			0
the @entity62 has yet to say when it will carry out its fact finding mission			2
accusations by rebels and @entity1 activist of at least three separate chlorine gas attacks by @entity0 's forces in the last month have exposed the limits of a deal which @entity0 agreed last year for the destruction of his chemical arsenal			1
the accord followed a sarin gas attack on rebel - held outskirts of @entity32 last august in which hundreds of people were killed			0
a man carries a wounded girl following a reported bombardment with explosive - packed ' barrel bombs ' by @entity1 government forces in the @entity140 neighborhood of the northern @entity1 city of @entity142 on sunday			0
@entity0 's regime is now being blamed for carrying out chemical attacks in the @entity113 province within the last two weeks @entity146 and its allies blamed @entity0 's forces for the attack , but @entity32 authorities said rebels carried it out to try to force @entity154 military intervention			1
@entity32 has now shipped out or destroyed 92 percent of the chemicals it pledged to eliminate			0
however chlorine , which also has many industrial uses , was never included in the list submitted to the @entity62			0
the @entity160 said last week that if @entity1 authorities used chlorine gas with the intent to kill or harm this would violate the @entity165 ( @entity165 ) , which it joined as part of last year 's agreement			2
in addition to the possible chlorine use , diplomats say @entity154 powers believe @entity1 may have not have declared all of its chemical stockpiles - an accusation which @entity1 has denied			2
meanwhile , state news agency @entity175 said the car bomb blast that struck in the predominantly @entity179 and @entity180 neighbourhood of @entity181 in @entity45 killed at least 40 and wounded another 116			0
this picture , of a boy said to have been injured in today 's mortar bomb blasts in @entity185 which claimed the lives of 14 people , was released by @entity1 's national news agency @entity175			0
doctors treat a wounded @entity1 boy at a hospital in @entity32 , @entity1 following mortar attacks in central @entity32 on tuesday @entity45 has been an opposition stronghold since the uprising against @entity0 erupted in march 2011			1
@entity1 ’s third largest city has been the scene of some of the fiercest fighting in the civil war that followed the initially peaceful revolt			0
in @entity32 , several mortar shells slammed into the predominantly @entity203 neighborhood of @entity204 , killing 14 people and wounding 86 , @entity175 and state tv reported			0
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks , which came a day after president @entity0 declared his candidacy for the june 3 presidential elections , a race he is likely to win			0
such attacks are common in @entity45 and @entity32 , and there was no immediate indication that the violence was directly related to @entity0 's announcement .			1
