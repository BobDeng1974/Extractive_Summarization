she might have missed out on the traditional breakfast of @entity3 cake but @entity5 @entity4 of @entity6 appeared to be enjoying her early start as she watched a military parade in @entity9			1
the parade , which was combined with a reception at the @entity12 , was held to mark @entity3 - a national holiday in @entity6			2
dressed in a floor - length teal gown , the 42 - year - old was all smiles as she was helped onto a red carpeted viewing platform ahead of proceedings			0
royal salute : @entity6 's @entity20 and @entity5 @entity4 watch the traditional @entity3 parade with husband @entity20 , 46 , by her side , she then stood to watch the procession before retreating back inside the palace to welcome @entity25 , the military archbishop of @entity6			1
the priest , 68 , has held the ceremonial role , which is similar to that of a @entity30 army chaplain , since 2000 , when @entity31 appointed him to the position			0
@entity9 's @entity3 parade is an annual tradition and is part of a day of celebration that sees the whole country come to a standstill			1
considered almost as important as christmas day itself , @entity3 marks the moment when baby jesus , then just a few days old , was seen for the first time by the @entity44 or @entity3			2
big day : @entity3 is almost as important as @entity45 in @entity6 and most towns stage a parade all smiles : the royals waved to well - wishers as they arrived with prime minister @entity51 ( left ) glamorous : @entity4 began the new year in style and wore a floor - length teal dress for the occasion ceremony : after the parade , the couple returned to the @entity12 for more @entity3 celebrations known in @entity6 as @entity3 ( @entity3 ) , it is celebrated with presents and colourful parades , the oldest of which takes place in @entity65			1
the biggest and most important , however , is @entity9 's - thanks in no small part to the presence of a real king at the procession			0
this year 's is @entity20 's first since becoming king in june 2014 and follows a turbulent @entity45 period for the @entity6 royals			1
on the 20th december , it was announced that @entity20 's older sister @entity74 , 49 , would go on trial for tax crimes			2

as a result , @entity74 has been asked to keep a low profile , has not been allowed to undertake royal duties since 2011 and was conspicuous by her absence at @entity20 's coronation			0
if convicted , which would be a first for @entity6 's royal family , she could face up to four years in prison as well as a multi-million pound fine			0

the rules , which also apply to @entity4 and his two daughters , came into effect on @entity115 and are intended to avoid ' compromising the dignity of the institution '			0
along with banning freebies , royals will be prevented from working in the private sector and all must behave in an ' exemplary manner ' likely to ' earn citizens ' appreciation , respect and trust			0
' looking good : @entity4 looked fresh - faced and relaxed following the @entity45 break difficult times : the 46 - year - old 's older sister @entity74 is set to stand trial on tax fraud charges later this year new rules : as a result , @entity20 has been forced to introduce new rules on royal behaviour dignity : royals are now expected to behave in ways that earn them citizens ' trust and appreciation first time : the event is the first that @entity20 has overseen since taking the throne in june last year			1
