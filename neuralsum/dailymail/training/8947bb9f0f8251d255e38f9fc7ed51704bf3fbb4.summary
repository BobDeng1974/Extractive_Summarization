former @entity1 striker @entity0 asked for the sprinklers to be turned on as he made his @entity4 debut in the unlikely surroundings of @entity8 's @entity7 stadium on wednesday night			1
@entity0 , who cost the @entity10 giants £ 5million , was given a rousing reception on the @entity13 ground as he played the second 45 minutes of a 1 - 1 draw against @entity16 side @entity15			1
it was vital preparation for the 29 - year - old @entity20 star ahead of next week 's key @entity22 clash against @entity23 and he made a point of telling the @entity8 's ground staff to give the turf an extra watering before he made his entrance			1
fresh face : @entity0 played the second half of @entity4 ' 1 - 1 draw with @entity15 at @entity7 debut @entity32 : @entity0 showed some neat touches during his 45 minutes on the pitch against @entity15 initially , @entity0 looked understandably rusty after an inactive summer but improved as the match wore on and made a couple of good runs in front of his new manager , @entity41 and @entity43 player @entity42			1
a small but noisy contingent of @entity10 fans chanted his name and the red - booted @entity0 made a point of running over to acknowledge them at the final whistle			0
the match at @entity7 with its capacity of just 6,355 represented a dramatic change of scene for the no 9 whose goal for @entity1 against @entity56 at @entity58 last season effectively handed the @entity60 title advantage to @entity61			0
his first appearance for @entity4 in front of a few hundred fans was the latest example of famous football players and managers making low - key debuts			2

@entity88 ’s @entity87 career started with a subsitute ’s appearance in a @entity92 tie at @entity93 while @entity94 ’ ill - fated reign as @entity87 manager last year began inauspiciously with a 1 - 0 defeat against the @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity100			2
ironically , last night 's match was organised by a company run by agent @entity104 's brother			0
@entity15 took the lead through @entity106 after 52 minutes with @entity107 levelling after 78 minutes			0
all smiles : @entity0 pats the back of one of the youngsters at @entity7 before @entity4 ' 1 - 1 draw @entity4 will now face @entity23 on @entity113 in their champions @entity115 third qualifying round first leg and their hopes will rest on @entity0			1
