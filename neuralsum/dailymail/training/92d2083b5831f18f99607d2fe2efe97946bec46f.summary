by @entity0 published : 16:27 est , 27 october 2012 updated : 04:08 est , 28 october 2012 my friendly acquaintance of many years , @entity1 , was arraigning me on the litany of false charges still cherished by much of the @entity6 press , partly from malice , but mainly from simple ignorance of the distant and prolonged disintegration of the @entity12 government ’s case against me			1
i had returned to @entity6 , after an absence of seven years , four hours before			2
familiar and unfounded though his allegations were , the jut - jawed righteousness with which he called me a criminal , the head - boy pieties , and this crusader of truth ’s imperturbable innocence of the profound corruption of the @entity12 legal system , stirred me from the fatigue of overnight air travel			1
he should have known better , but there is no reason why his viewers , or @entity30 ’s readers , should			2
the 17 criminal charges against me were all abandoned , rejected by jurors , or unanimously vacated by the @entity33			2
i won : @entity1 's accusations were unfounded and ignorant and @entity35 is a banana , says former owner of the @entity38 @entity0 the authors of the allegations that led to the criminal charges have agreed to pay me $ 6 million ( £ 3.7 million ) , almost four times the largest previous libel settlement in @entity45 history			1
the @entity12 @entity33 remanded back to an appeals judge it had excoriated the vacated counts for assessment of his own errors , to see if any part of the prosecution should survive			2
the unchastened lower court judge retrieved the two least counts , putting a fig - leaf on the failed prosecution			2
i had been sent to prison for three years , where i was a tutor and was able to help more than 100 students			2
and , with access to emails , i was able to build an @entity12 and @entity45 weekly readership of my magazine and newspaper columns of about four million			2
i made the most of a bad hand			2
the pitiful vestiges of the case against me are again under appeal , and here i was , wearily listening to the wide - faced priggishness of good old @entity1			1
i played my part and recited the facts , somewhat histrionically			2
my inquisitor fell back to , ‘ but you were convicted			2
’ more facts , tedious and inconvenient , were called for			1
in @entity12 prosecutions , 97 per cent of cases result in guilty pleas and avoid trials			2
and 85 per cent of the three per cent that are tried result in convictions and sentences four times as severe as the sentences of those who waive their constitutional right to a trial			0
inquisitor : @entity1 interviewed @entity0 about his time in prison in the @entity12 the procedural rules are terribly uneven in favour of the prosecutors , who speak last to the jury , which relies entirely on its memory , even in a complicated four - month commercial trial like that of my co-defendants and myself			1
the great majority of @entity12 judges are ex-prosecutors			0
the conviction rate in the @entity12 is 150 per cent that of @entity45 and almost twice that of the @entity6 , and the prosecutors of both those countries would be disbarred for the plea bargaining - extortion and subornation that is the core of the @entity12 system			0
in our case , convictions were only produced on the basis of the @entity111 , which was designed to deal with bribes , and was unanimously struck down by the high court as unconstitutional and inapplicable on the facts			0
the @entity12 is being milked by an avaricious legal cartel that drains away ten per cent of the annual gdp and terrorised by a lawless prosecutocracy that tore down a six - term @entity118 , @entity119 , who was subsequently proved to have been framed on the basis of false evidence			0
this scandalous official corruption and hypocrisy , which strikes to the heart of @entity12 ’s claim to be a society of laws and respect for individual liberties , is becoming a matter of journalistic concern in the @entity12			0
but none of my interviewers in this busy press week in @entity133 seemed to have the least awareness of it			0
no contest : @entity0 disagrees that @entity35 got the better of him on have i got news for you on friday these were the odds i faced in the @entity12 courts , 99.5 to one , and this was what i faced in the @entity133 media as i promoted my book , a matter of principle			1
the book recounts the events and the daunting correlation of forces between my legal and journalistic accusers and myself			0
this latest trip into the lion ’s den began when @entity158 cancelled my planned interview with the admirable @entity160 , and sent the notorious @entity161 in her place to @entity163 to write the hit job published there last week			1
armed with a box of chocolates and fine photographs of my wife and her dogs , she caused me to agree to the very fair interview in @entity30 with @entity172 , published on the same day			0
ms @entity161 acted in conformity with the inexplicable @entity175 policy of assailing me at every opportunity since the problem arose ( apart from @entity179 ’s magnanimous apology in its leading editorial when i was upheld in the @entity33 )			0
so did @entity182 ’s @entity181 , the day after the @entity1 encounter , with similarly pyrotechnic results , although time , if not taste or fairness , prevented him from dredging up the @entity187 myth that i had been driven by a spendthrift and overbearing wife ( who has in fact been magnificent beyond praise ) to prodigies of extravagance			1
@entity181 could do with a lengthy term in charm school , despite having somehow attracted the lovely @entity197			0
love is blind , i guess			0
i am grateful for , and accept as an olive branch , @entity175 ’s tweet this week commending my performance at @entity38 and ascribing my legal travails , accurately , to the betrayal of a former associate			1
the rest of the week has been quite civil , although i write without having seen have i got news for you			1
my captain , @entity209 , and the chairman , @entity210 , were very gracious , though @entity35 , as i suggested to him , has not progressed much beyond his days as editor of @entity212			1
i will deal with @entity213 , exhumed briefly by @entity214 , in the @entity215 in @entity163			0
the book has been well launched and the @entity133 media have been updated			0
and i am truly grateful to many @entity6 friends for their solidarity through these difficult years since i was last here , especially those who visited and emailed me in prison , and for their hospitality this week			0
@entity223 and i will be back in the @entity224 , and look forward to it			0
since his return to @entity6 , @entity0 has been busy , including appearing on @entity227 ’s have i got news for you on friday			1
the first of his combative altercations with team captain and private eye editor @entity35 arose from a debate about @entity235 travelling first - class			1
host @entity210 turned this into a discussion about @entity0 ’s fortune			1
@entity240 : i think i read in @entity241 that you said that despite everything you are still worth about $ 80 million			0
is that right ? @entity0 : no , i had said i had lost 80 per cent of my money fighting this oppression from the @entity12 government			1
so he said that leaves you with $ 80 million.ih : did they invade you ? i must have missed @entity251 : i said i thought i could live on $ 80 million if that was what i had			0
you still call it a great office of state you know			0
ca n’t he travel first class ? @entity260 : we ’re still in the middle of this austerity thing			0
did you have that ? have i got news for you : @entity35 on friday 's show the main battle , however , took place after @entity0 was asked to answer a question about @entity271 ’s speech on crime			1
@entity240 : also this week , what has @entity271 been saying about criminals			0
@entity0 ? @entity0 : that in this great @entity6 those officially so designated may actually have broken the law and that this is a departure from some transatlantic @entity278 : he did n’t really make a decision that innocent people should not go to jail , did he ? @entity0 : does this require the truth , @entity284 ? @entity260 : i know you ’re not used to that , @entity288 : not used to hearing it , @entity290 : what about from the jury ? @entity0 : nine acquittals and they sort of ran out of steam but the @entity33 made up for it @entity296 : no , you did n’t run out of steam , you ran into jail			1
they found you guilty did n’t they ? the jury ? @entity0 : nine acquittals complemented by a unanimous vacation of the four guilty verdicts by the @entity33 of the @entity307 : but two stuck did n’t they ? one for fraud and one for obstruction of @entity311 : no , no , oh @entity35 , please			1
@entity260 : oh , stop reciting the verdict as though it was true			0
@entity0 : a little respect for due process , @entity35			1
[ earlier , @entity0 referred to the @entity318 editor ’s famous quote , after losing a libel action : ‘ if that ’s justice , then i ’m a banana			1
’ ] @entity260 : i do respect it			0
i am not a banana			2
all i am saying is that you were found guilty			0
you would like to be @entity329 : no , i have been rehabilitated and i am proud to have been cleared by the @entity33 unanimously , and i have come here			0
@entity260 : you were n’t cleared ! you have come here to say you ’re innocent , which is sweet but not @entity334 were then shown a clip from @entity1 ’s @entity214 interview with @entity0 , in which the peer said he was proud he had endured the tense exchange without ‘ getting up and smashing your face in ’			1
@entity240 : did that feel good ? @entity0 : not as good as doing it			1
i like @entity1 , he ’s just an a * * hole , that ’s @entity347 : it ’s unbelievable you get away with that really – a man asking you questions about being a fraudster , and you just say , ‘ he ’s an a * * hole			1

former owner of the @entity38 *proclaims* himself the *winner* of his latest spats with @entity1 and @entity35
@entity0 called @entity35 a banana on have i got news for you on friday night
