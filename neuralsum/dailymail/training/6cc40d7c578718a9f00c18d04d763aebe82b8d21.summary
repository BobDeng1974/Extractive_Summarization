they are n't exactly two peas in a pod , but @entity3 and sir @entity4 shared a bond in science — and were so close that the guitarist even bought sir @entity4 's house to make sure he could live there for the rest of his life			1
@entity3 bought @entity12 , the house in @entity14 , @entity15 for £ 480,000 in 2008 , paying about £ 40,000 above the market value to ensue the astronomer could stay in the home he had lived in for four decades			1
sir @entity4 died peacefully at his home last week , aged 89			1
@entity3 , right , and sir @entity4 pictured in 2008			2
the pair shared a twin love of music and science according to @entity25 , @entity3 leased the property back to @entity4 on the same day he bought it — charging ' one peppercorn if demanded ' for a 25 - year lease			1
however , the @entity31 guitarist is furious about the @entity25 ' report and has released an angry statement on his website			1
it reads : ' sir @entity4 is not even laid to rest yet , but i have just heard that @entity25 ( yes , them again ) have been sneaking around , like the carrion eaters they are , and are now about to " reveal " all the details they 've managed to sniff out about how we , as @entity4 's friends , helped him in his latter years , to stay functional in his own home to the very end			1
' i 'm actually amazed and quite disgusted that these press people are so intrusive and nosy			2
' is there no respect at all ? ' these matters were private , between friends			2
what motivates these grubby little people to go snooping around ? ' music of the spheres : sir @entity4 was a keen xylophone player in a statement to @entity55 , may said it was too soon to decide the future of the house , but hinted it 's myriad scientific treasures could be opened up for the public to see			1
he said : ' it 's too early to be able to comment meaningfully on this			1
as @entity4 's friends , we have been discussing possible futures for some time , but until now the first priority has always been safeguarding the quality of @entity4 's life while he was alive			1
' it will take time to assess what the possibilities now are			2
' may , who has an estimate fortune of £ 90m , described sir @entity4 as a ' father figure ' who inspired him to study for a phd in astrophysics			2
he had been a fan of the astronomer since childhood , when he begged his parents to let him stay up late to watch @entity83 , the show sir @entity4 presented for 55 years			1
the two connected in person after working on a radio play together , and later co-authored the book bang ! the @entity89			2
they also shared a love of music – sir @entity4 was a self - taught xylophone player , and at @entity12 he had one rule for guests : nobody was to touch the xylophone			1
@entity4 also wrote more than 100 musical compositions , including a march in praise of @entity101 , and once listened to a viennese waltz on his car radio before realising he had written it			0
the astronomer was a well - known socialite , and often hosted parties at @entity14 with @entity3 and his wife @entity107			0
sir @entity108 for £ 4,000 in cash in 1967			0
it was also home to his private observatory in the event of his death , the astronomer was clear about what he wanted			1
he would not have a funeral , but a party – ‘ quite a show			0
’ his family and friends have vowed to do just that			0
sir @entity108 for £ 4,000 in cash in 1967			0
eventually , he had four observatories in his back garden and was devastated when they were damaged in a storm in 1998			0
but the house was never financially secure			0
@entity129 said sir @entity4 instead spent his money on telescopes , annual @entity134 parties for the village and helping young astronomers through university			0
neighbour @entity138 , 73 , said : ' he never was aware how much money he had or how little he had			0
quite often the accountant said , " no more spending this week , @entity4			0
" ' @entity3 said if ever i saw him looking as though he was getting into trouble to give him a call			0
and he just turned up			0
' in an obituary for the astronomer , @entity3 wrote of his friend 's generous nature : ' his dedication to young aspiring astronomers was legendary			1
' he gave away any income he made to the point where he had no security himself except that which his friends supplied			0

may , also a stargazer , bought his friend and mentor 's home so he could stay there until his death
the two shared a love of the night *sky* and music
but @entity31 guitarist is furious that @entity25 exposes the home *purchase*
