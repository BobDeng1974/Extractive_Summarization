a sociology professor in @entity1 has recommended @entity3 whistleblower @entity2 for the @entity4			1
in a letter addressed to the @entity7 and published in @entity1 newspaper @entity8 , professor @entity5 nominated @entity2 for his ' heroic effort at great personal cost ' shedding light on the expansive cyber-spying conducted by the @entity3			1
because of his bravery , @entity2 ' helped to make the world a little bit better and safer , ' @entity13 wrote			0
scroll down for full letter @entity1 supporter : @entity5 , professor of sociology at @entity21 , sent a letter to the @entity7 nominating @entity2 for the @entity4 a nomination for @entity2 would be symbolic because it shows ' that individuals can stand up for fundamental rights and freedoms			1
' history : the @entity4 has been awarded to 124 times since 1901 @entity5 compares @entity2 's act to the rulings in the @entity32 of 1945 because ' i was just following orders ' was not held as a viable excuse for the @entity36 who carried out human rights atrocities			1
@entity13 also believes this will help the @entity4 regain some of respect it lost after prematurely awarding @entity40 the award in 2009			2
' it would show its willingness to stand up in defense of civil liberties and human rights , even when such a defense [ could ] be viewed with disfavor by the world 's dominant military power			0
' but it may be too late for @entity2 to receive the award this year			2
nominations for laureates must be postmarked no later than february 1 for consideration in the following december 's prizes			0
between the months of march and august the advisers review the short list of candidates			0
however , @entity5 ' nomination should be taken seriously by the committee for next year 's prize			1
as a sociology professor at @entity21 , he counts as one of the ' qualified ' people who can send their nominations to the committee			2
these qualified people include : members of national assemblies and governments of states ; members of international courts ; university rectors ; professors of social sciences , history , philosophy , law and theology ; directors of peace research institutes and foreign policy institutes ; recipients of the prize ; board members of organizations that have been awarded the prize ; active members of the @entity7 ; former advisers of the @entity7			0
the @entity4 was started in 1901 and has been awarded to 100 individuals and 24 organizations			2
@entity93 : as a professor of sociology at @entity21 in @entity1 , @entity5 is one of the few that are allowed to make recommendations to the committee the process : candidates are nominated before february 1 and then go through a nearly year - long review up until the december award ceremony too soon : many criticized the premature awarding of the peace prize to president @entity40 in 2009 it was the last prize described in @entity109 's will , which left most of his fortune to the creation of the prizes			1
other @entity113 are awarded in the areas of physics , chemistry , medicine and literature			0
the peace prize is awarded each year to ' the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations , for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses			0
' though @entity2 is eligible for nomination for the december 2014 prize , it 's unlikely he 'd be able to travel to @entity133 for the award ceremony			1
@entity2 applied for asylum in @entity136 on july 2 , but the country then planned to reject it according to their national law			2
' according to @entity136 law , one ca n't seek asylum abroad and the normal procedures stipulate that the asylum application from @entity2 will be rejected , ' @entity141 , @entity142 state secretary told news agency @entity146			2
if @entity2 is awarded the prize in 2014 , he would be the youngest @entity4 in the history of the prize			1
best committee members ! i suggest that the @entity152 awarded to the @entity154 citizen @entity153 has - in a heroic effort at great personal cost - revealed the existence and extent of the surveillance , the @entity154 government devotes electronic communications worldwide			0
by putting light on this monitoring program - conducted in contravention of national laws and international agreements - @entity2 has helped to make the world a little bit better and safer.through his personal efforts , he has also shown that individuals can stand up for fundamental rights and freedoms			0
this example is important because since the @entity32 in 1945 has been clear that the slogan " i was just following orders " is never claimed as an excuse for acts contrary to human rights and freedoms			0
despite this , it is very rare that individual citizens having the insight of their personal responsibility and courage @entity2 shown in his revelation of the @entity154 surveillance program			0
for this reason , he is a highly affordable @entity189 decision to award the 2013 prize to @entity2 would - in addition to being well justified in itself - also help to save the @entity4 from the disrepute that incurred by the hasty and ill - conceived decision to award @entity154 president @entity40 2009 award			1
it would show its willingness to stand up in defense of civil liberties and human rights , even when such a defense be viewed with disfavour by the world 's dominant military @entity204 , @entity5 professor of sociology at @entity21			1

@entity5 , sociology professor at @entity21 , nominated @entity2 for the @entity4
@entity2 will not be eligible for this year 's prize , which will be awarded in december 2013 - but could be considered for 2014
the @entity3 whistleblower would have a hard time accepting the award , as he has already *unsuccessfully* applied for asylum in @entity136
