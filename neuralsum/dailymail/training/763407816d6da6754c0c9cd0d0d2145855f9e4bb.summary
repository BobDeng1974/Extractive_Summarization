by @entity0 a trainee nurse has been awarded over £ 75,000 compensation after a prick on her finger at work transformed her into a cleaning obsessive			1
@entity6 could not kiss or make love to her husband for fear of ' contamination ' after being jabbed with a dirty needle whilst working as a nurse assistant at @entity13 in east @entity14			1
the 45 - year - old developed a ' severe ' obsessive compulsive disorder focused on cleanliness after the incident in february 2008 , a court heard			1
@entity6 , pictured , developed a ' severe ' obsessive compulsive disorder focused on cleanliness , after being accidentally jabbed with a dirty needle whilst working at @entity13 , east @entity14 she was dismissed from her job due to the effects of the extreme @entity26 condition , which saw her wearing gloves even in baking hot weather and scrubbing her children ’s shoes with bleach whenever they had been outside			1
but the most damaging aspect of her condition was that she became incapable of having intimate relations with , or even kissing , her bus driver husband , leading to the disintegration of their marriage , after he dubbed her ' mental '			1
now she has been awarded damages by a judge , including more than £ 20,000 for her ‘ pain and suffering ’ , which takes into account the fact that her marriage broke down due to her condition			2
judge @entity47 , sitting at @entity48 , said that the mother - of - five was employed as a nursing assistant and was working towards becoming a fully qualified nurse by studying at night school			2
but her career was destroyed when she was accidentally stabbed in the finger by a dirty needle sticking out of an ' over full ' sharps bin in an operating theatre			0
despite being given the all - clear after blood tests to rule out hepatitis and hiv infection , mrs @entity6 ’s distress and anxiety about what had happened to her continued to increase , with her ' main anxieties revolving around her @entity61 status ' , the judge said			1
her symptoms snowballed until ' a diagnosis of @entity26 at the severe end of the scale ... making it impossible for her to return to work and having a significant impact on her life , most seriously on the breakdown of her marriage , ' the judge added			2
@entity6 was working as a trainee nurse at @entity13 , pictured , in east @entity14 when the accident happened @entity79 admitted primary liability for the accident and its alarming consequences for mrs @entity6 , but hotly disputed the extent of mrs @entity6 ’s difficulties and the amount of compensation she deserved			1
judge @entity47 ruled that mrs @entity6 ought to be compensated for her inability to work for the past five years			2
he told the court : ' i am quite satisfied that her continued absence from work after her accident was as a result of the injury she received and her - albeit excessive - psychological reaction to it			1
' he added that mrs @entity6 ' developed a habit of compulsive cleaning ' after the injury despite having blood tests for hepatitis b and @entity101 and @entity61 which came back negative two weeks after the accident			1
' the average person , armed with normal fortitude , would have been able to get on with his or her life , no doubt making a firm mental note to be more careful of the sharps bin			0
@entity6 became incapable of having intimate relations with , or even kissing , her bus driver husband , leading to the disintegration of their marriage , the court heard ' unfortunately , mrs @entity6 was unable to get on in this way			1
she suffered from what can only be described as an eggshell psychology , ' he added			0
describing her condition , the judge went on : ' she feels the need to clean and re-clean crockery , cutlery and her house generally			0
' she began to wear gloves in everyday activities because she was concerned she might contaminate her family			0
' she felt unable to go out , avoiding leaving the home and endeavouring for some time to prevent her children from going out , except for school			0
' when they returned from school , she washed their outside school clothing every day and ensured their shoes were scrubbed with bleach			0
' she felt unable to have any physical intimacy with her husband for fear she would contaminate him			0
this led , after an initial period of support , to the breakup of their relationship			0
' even a kiss left her in fear of contamination and resulted in her need to wash			2
' of course , there is more to marriage than physical intimacy - mrs @entity6 describes a good working friendly relationship with her husband whilst they brought up their children			1
' but their emotional as well as their physical relationship has now broken down			0
' while there was initial support from her husband , he now describes her as mental			0
' judge @entity47 awarded her damages for five years of pain , suffering and loss of earnings , including more than £ 20,000 ' for the disruption to her work , her life and her marriage ' , caused by her ' fear of contamination			1
' however he declined to give her an award for future losses , saying mrs @entity6 now has hopes for a brighter future , after her five years of hell			0
the judge said that recent psychology reports had concluded that ' her prognosis for a return to her pre-accident state was good ' if she undertook appropriate counseling			0
@entity183 , for mrs @entity6 , said of her client : ' she only has one friend as a result of her @entity26			1
' her boundaries have shrunk and she lives a very insular life , focused on keeping her house very , very clean			0
' mrs @entity6 declined to comment after the hearing .			2
