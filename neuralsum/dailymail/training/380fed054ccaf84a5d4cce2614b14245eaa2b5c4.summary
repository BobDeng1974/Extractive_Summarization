by @entity0 published : 10:07 est , 7 february 2013 updated : 21:01 est , 7 february 2013 doctors failed to spot that @entity2 had a retained placenta after she gave birth to daughter @entity5 a mother has described her suffering after bungling medics left her placenta inside her – for two agonising months			1
@entity2 , 30 , says doctors failed to spot the potentially fatal complication when she gave birth to daughter @entity5			1
in the eight weeks that followed , her battle with constant pain and exhaustion left her unable to breastfeed			2
but she claims that doctors at @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , were n’t interested in her plight – and even refused to examine her when she went to @entity20			1
in desperation , she eventually booked an appointment with a private gynaecologist , who told her that she had not delivered the placenta and it had become infected inside her			1
she said : ‘ i was really ill [ after the birth ]			2
i was sent back to @entity26 ’s two weeks later and they admitted me to the gynaecology ward			2
‘ i told the gynaecologist how ill i ’d been and she was n’t interested			1
the doctor at my eight - week check - up was n’t interested either			0
‘ i was in lower - back and stomach agony and i did n’t have any energy			1
i ’d tried to breastfeed , but i was too exhausted			0
‘ i did n’t bond with my daughter because i felt so ill and i had a bit of post-natal depression as a result			1
it made a big impact on my life			0
’ she has now set up a charity to support expectant mothers			0
‘ i do n’t want this to happen to someone else , ’ she said			0
the placenta normally separates from the uterine wall during delivery and is expelled from the vagina within 30 minutes after giving birth			2
if part or all of it fails to be delivered , the uterus ca n't contract and close off all the necessary blood vessels			2
this means it will continue to bleed and it can lead to infection			0
in extreme cases this haemorrhage can cause death , so it 's extremely important that tissue is removed			0
if the doctor is unable to do this by hand then surgery is needed			0
‘ my aim is to build a network of midwives , social workers and mums with their own stories to help and guide women who are struggling			0
’ the make - up and hair designer , from @entity17 , said doctors at @entity16 had mentioned the condition ‘ retained placenta ’ anecdotally but did not diagnose her with it following @entity5 ’s birth last june			1
retained placenta is potentially life - threatening if left untreated because it carries a high risk of infection or internal bleeding			2
a spokesman for @entity16 said : ‘ i am sorry if ms @entity2 is unhappy with the care she received			1
we have not received a complaint from ms @entity2 , but would be happy to look into her concerns if she would like to contact us			1
’ on the website she has set up , miss @entity2 explained that she struggled to breastfeed @entity5 because her blood count was half what it should be			1
a spokesman from @entity16 in @entity17 , said : ' i am sorry if ms @entity2 is unhappy with the care she received ' ‘ after having @entity5 , i felt seriously ill , ’ she said			1
‘ however , the hospital and my own gp told me there was nothing wrong with me , and that it was normal to feel like this after giving birth			0
in fact , after my gp told me that i had an alarming amount of white blood cells , i paid privately to get to the bottom of the problem			0
‘ the only issue health visitors or gynaecologists from the @entity112 seemed to care about was that i was not breastfeeding			0
‘ the fact that i could not breastfeed because i was so unwell did n’t occur to them			0
’ ms @entity2 has set up a non-for profit organisation to support women having problems during pregnancy or as new mothers			1
