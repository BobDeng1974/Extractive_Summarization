by @entity0 @entity2 goalkeeper @entity1 is to take a break from international football for the next year but is not ready to call time on his career with the @entity7 yet			1
the 35 - year - old attained hero status in his homeland during the @entity10 , making a tournament record 15 saves as the @entity7 took @entity13 to extra-time before losing 2 - 1 in the knockout stages			1
in a statement released thursday via his @entity17 page and @entity18 , @entity1 said he was keen to spend more time with his family but does not want to retire yet - something @entity7 coach @entity21 is willing to accept			1
break time : @entity1 said on @entity17 that he needed to make a commitment to his family ' having played overseas for the last 12 years and missing out on spending time with my family , making this commitment to my family is very important at this time , ' said @entity1			2
' i am grateful for the willingness of both @entity21 and @entity2 manager @entity29 to afford me the opportunity to spend time with my kids			2
it 's the right decision at the right time			0
' @entity21 has always been up front with all the players in saying you have to earn your place , which is something i agree with , so i look forward to coming back next fall and competing for a spot			2
' @entity21 said : ' we had a very good and productive conversation			0
i totally understand @entity1 's situation			1
he was very straightforward and honest in his approach , and i admire him for that			0
admiration : @entity21 said he admired @entity1 's honesty and that the keeper will be welcomed back working hard : the break from international football will allow @entity1 to focus on his family and @entity2 ' he has a wish to take a step back to take care of his family , and we came to the conclusion that it 's absolutely fine that he takes time off from international soccer until after next summer 's @entity59 , and then we reevaluate			1
' i told him as long as he is the same @entity1 we always see performing well , he will be welcome back with open arms and right back competing for a spot			0
' he knows he has to prove that he deserves to be back			0
' @entity1 's appearances in @entity64 this summer took him to 104 caps , the most all - time by an @entity67 goalkeeper			1
old favourite : @entity1 has been a key member of the @entity7 for a dozen years , winning over 100 caps number one : @entity1 played 37 times in the league for the @entity2 last season and was a key performer taking a year out will cost him the chance to feature in eight friendlies as well as the @entity59 , and once he returns he will likely face a fight to regain a spot which @entity80 goalkeeper @entity79 will be the favourite to inherit			1
@entity83 's 35 - year - old goalkeeper @entity82 was the third goalkeeper taken to @entity64			0
' this gives us a huge opportunity to see @entity79 and @entity82 going forward and fighting for the no. 1 spot , ' @entity21 added			2
' we have young talented goalkeepers with @entity89 and @entity90 , who have been brought along the last couple years , so this may give them a chance here and there to get some game time			0
' always when somebody steps aside for a moment , it gives an opportunity for the next ones in line			0

@entity7 goalkeeper will take a break until after next summer 's @entity59
@entity1 was a crucial part in @entity18 's *successful* @entity10 campaign
@entity2 goalkeeper agreed the move with coach @entity21
@entity112 *stopper* @entity79 likely to fill @entity1 's position
