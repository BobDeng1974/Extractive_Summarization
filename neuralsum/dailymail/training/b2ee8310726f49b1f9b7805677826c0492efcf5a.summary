the @entity1 fashion expansion into the @entity2 is gathering pace , with @entity4 opening branches in @entity6 and @entity7 just days after @entity8 and @entity9 also stuck their flags in local groud			1
the elegant high - street label , a home - grown favourite of both the @entity15 and @entity16 that was founded in 1978 , already has shops in @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			2
moreover , @entity4 ' expansion into @entity23 is , perhaps , a preamble to a further expansion in the opposite direction : the brand is currently in discussion with a large @entity30 department store about opening a concession in spring / summer 2014			1
@entity32 of @entity33 , left , in @entity4 at the january unveiling of her portrait in the @entity36 , and @entity16 , right , in @entity4 at the @entity37 in @entity38 in 2011 the expansion will see ' shop in shops ' opening in august in two key @entity44 department stores : one in @entity6 , the other in a newly opened @entity47 site			1
the brand will be situated in the contemporary area and will carry products from the catwalk show as well as best selling leather , cashmere and silk pieces			0
the collection will also be available at @entity44 online			2
the move sees the next phase in the brand 's wholesale expansion strategy , the first phase of which saw it showcase the @entity63 collection for the first time at @entity65 to international press and buyers			1
increased demand in online sales from @entity23 - and a boom in buyers from the region shopping in the brand 's @entity74 stores - prompted the expansion			1
@entity15 , wearing whistles , talking with prince @entity78 at the @entity79 in 2012 - incidentally , the woman behind @entity15 is also wearing @entity4 @entity4 chief executive @entity81 told @entity82 : ' we realised that the brand appeals to the @entity86 aesthetic , in that it is feminine , but with a clean , modern feel			0
' @entity7 is an increasingly sophisticated market , and there seems to be a growing middle class customer , who does n't necessarily want to only buy into the luxury labels - but also wants to shop contemporary @entity74 brands that provide well - designed quality fashion at a price that they can afford			0
' founded in @entity98 in 1978 , @entity4 began as an independent boutique and has since evolved into a leading womenswear brand , characterised by its contemporary , intelligent sense of style and design			0
@entity105 and his girlfriend @entity104 , wearing whistles , at the final of the men 's single tennis tournament at the @entity110 last year @entity32 of @entity33 , @entity105 's girlfriend @entity104 , and prime minister @entity112 's wife @entity16 are and staunch supporters of the brand , but @entity115 says film director @entity116 is their style muse , and their ' go - to woman for inspiration '			1
@entity81 , ceo of @entity4 the former @entity15 and her sister @entity119 both have wardrobes full of @entity4 clothes , and the @entity15 is not afraid to show her thrifty side by recycling them : last summer she wore the £ 150 blue @entity125 dress to both the @entity126 and the @entity127			0
despite the clothes @entity15 wears selling out moments after she is photographed wearing them , @entity115 denies the so - called ' @entity15 effect ' has boosted sales			0
speaking in 2012 , she said : ' it raises profile , it ’s great , we get known in countries we 're not known in			0
but it 's not going to turn us into a success overnight because she wears it			0
' fortunately , she looks great in it and it 's a great advert , but no more than that			0
' earlier this month @entity1 fashion chain @entity8 opened its first @entity6 outlet today , becoming the latest @entity144 brand to brave the city 's astronomical rents in a bid to crack the lucrative @entity7 market			1
@entity8 boss @entity149 cut the ribbon to the 1,300 - square - meter ( 14,000 - square - foot ) shop with the help of @entity154 actress @entity153			0
@entity149 said he wants to use the store , located in the city 's central business district , as a ' stepping stone ' to mainland @entity7			2
he 's looking for possible locations in @entity160 and @entity47 to open ' flagship ' stores			0
other foreign retailers that have launched recently in the @entity23 finance center include @entity30 brands @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity167			0
foreign brands have been lining up to open showcase boutiques in @entity6 as they try to get a share of the spending by the increasingly affluent consumers visiting from mainland @entity7 , the world 's second biggest economy			1
the demand has helped drive up shop rents in @entity6 , a former @entity1 colony that 's now a special administrative region of @entity7			1
sir @entity149 , 61 , posed with actress @entity153 to cut the ribbon at the grand opening of @entity6 's new store @entity8 boss @entity149 cut the ribbon to the 1,300 - square - meter ( 14,000 - square - foot ) shop with the help of @entity154 actress @entity153 and last week luxury @entity1 stationary and leather goods house @entity9 - proud owners of three royal warrants , and with clients including the royal family and @entity192 - opened a standalone shop in @entity6			1

the brand already have a concession in @entity199 in @entity6 , but the new boutique marks a step up for the company which last year witnessed saw turnover rise to £ 24.5m in the year to march , up from £ 20.2m a year earlier			2

the new boutique is housed in @entity210 in the @entity212 district , and reflects the style and intrinsic @entity1 identity of the brand , as found in the company 's @entity98 flagships in new @entity218 and @entity219			2
