a shocking new video appearing to show at least 30 @entity1 being beheaded and shot by @entity2 in @entity3 has been released			1
the 29 - minute video , titled ' until it came to them - @entity7 ' , shows dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive , thought to be in the south and the west of the country			1
at least 16 men , described by @entity14 as the ' followers of the cross from the enemy @entity18 ' , are lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others are filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded			1
this follows another video in february of the beheading of a group of 21 @entity26 on the beach in @entity3 , though that terrain was rockier than the one shown in the latest film			1
it raises fears that @entity2 is consolidating its presence on the ' doorstep of @entity34 ' , as @entity3 is just a few hundred miles from the coast of @entity36			1
above , at least 16 men are marched down a beach in @entity3 by militants before they are killed @entity45 was unable to confirm its citizens were killed in the footage but condemned the ' atrocious act ' , a government official said			1
the video shows the men at the coast wearing @entity54 - style orange jumpsuits and being held at the neck by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces			2
the victims inland are forced to kneel as militants dressed in combats and green masks stand behind them holding rifles			1
it starts with what it called a ' history of @entity70 relations ' , which includes scenes of militants destroying churches , graves and icons			2
a masked fighter in black then brandishes a pistol as he vows to kill @entity1 if they do not convert			1
in an apparent reference to @entity45 's attacks on neighbouring @entity81 , whose population is almost entirely @entity70 , he says : ' @entity70 blood shed under the hands of your religions is not cheap			1
to the nation of the cross we are now back again			0
' the footage , which was released on websites and social media accounts officially linked to @entity2 , also cuts to @entity1 in @entity94 explaining how they were given the choice of converting to @entity96 or paying a ' special tax '			1
at the end it switches between the two sets of captives - thought to be mainly migrant workers - with one group shot dead at point - blank range and the others beheaded on the beach			1
the video has not yet been verified			2
the men - wearing @entity54 - style orange jumpsuits - are held at the neck and forced to kneel by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces the men , thought to be migrant works , are described by @entity14 in the video as the ' followers of the cross from the enemy @entity18 ' the footage also shows around 12 men being shot in a desert area , believed to be in the south of the country , by militants wearing green balaclavas and combats a masked fighter in black ( right ) brandishing a pistol vows to kill @entity1 if they do not convert , saying : ' @entity70 blood shed under the hands of your religions is not cheap			1
to the nation of the cross we are now back again ' the victims are forced to kneel in front of the militants ( above ) before being shot at point - blank range simultaneously			2

the @entity18 is one of the oldest organized @entity70 bodies in the world , and more than 40 per cent of the population are members of the church			0
around 20 per cent of the population follow other branches of @entity165 , a majority being @entity167			0

the video bore the official logo of the @entity177 media arm @entity145 and resembled previous footage released by the extremist group			1
@entity180 , an @entity39 government spokesman , said officials were in contact with its embassy in @entity184 to verify the video 's authenticity			2
he said he believed those killed were likely to have been @entity39 migrants hoping to reach @entity34			0
@entity3 has become a hub for migrants across @entity191 hoping to cross the @entity192 to enter @entity34 for work and better lives			2
' if this is confirmed , it will be a warning to people who wish to risk and travel to @entity34 though the dangerous route , ' mr @entity180 said			0

@entity202 , an official with the @entity39 @entity204 's @entity203 , said he also believed the victims were likely to have been migrants			0
' i believe this is just another case of the @entity209 killing @entity1 in the name of @entity96			2
our fellow citizens have just been killed on a faith - based violence that is totally unacceptable			2
this is outrageous , ' he said			0
' no religion orders the killing of other people , even people from another religion			0
' @entity45 's options to retaliate remain slim , given its distance from @entity3			1
however , @entity39 ambassador to @entity225 @entity224 said his country could partner with @entity184 to strike the militants			1
' that could be an option , ' mr @entity224 said			0
' we will see and explore what is possible to deal with group			0
