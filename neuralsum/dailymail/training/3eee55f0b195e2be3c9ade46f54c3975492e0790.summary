it is not often that @entity1 finds itself receiving a rejection letter from a would - be student , rather than issuing them with one			2
so it will have raised a few scholarly eyebrows when state - educated @entity7 , 19 , wrote to the elite institution ’s @entity9 without even waiting to hear whether her application to read law had been successful			1
in a parody of @entity1 ’s own rejection letters , she told admissions tutors : ‘ i realise you may be disappointed by this decision , but you were in competition with many fantastic universities and following your interview i am afraid you do not quite meet the standard of the universities i will be considering			1
’ mocking : a-level student @entity7 , who is predicted a * s in history , law and @entity27 literature , sent a scathing rejection letter to @entity9 , @entity1 miss @entity7 , who says she changed her mind about @entity1 after being put off by her experience at interview , claimed its admissions process was biased against state - school pupils – despite them making up more than half the university ’s intake			1
she wrote : ‘ whilst you may believe your decision to hold interviews in grand formal settings is inspiring , it allows public school applicants to flourish in the environment they are accustomed to and intimidates state school applicants , distorting the true academic potential of both			0
’ the teenager also claimed there were ‘ significant flaws ’ in @entity1 ’s education system and argued that the ‘ gap between elitism and discrimination ’ was a ‘ narrow one ’ that the college had not ‘ adequately addressed ’			2
rejected : @entity7 told @entity9 , which counts foreign secretary @entity54 among its alumni , that there were ' significant flaws ' in its education system she wrote : ‘ whilst you may believe your traditions and rituals are impressive , they reflect badly on your university … frankly , i feel humiliated for both you and your students			1
’ describing the interview process as ‘ torture ’ , she accused the college of being ‘ rude ’ for not offering her a glass of water			0
she also claimed there was an ‘ obvious gap ’ between minorities and white middle - class students that she found ‘ embarrassing ’			1
letter in full : the rejection letter that @entity7 , 19 , sent to @entity1 via email miss @entity7 , of @entity78 , @entity79 , even cheekily warned the university to hold off on any attempts to ‘ reapply ’ and wished it ‘ every success in future ’			1
@entity1 yesterday hit back at her claims , pointing to figures that show that for 2010 entry , 55.4 per cent of places for @entity88 students went to state school pupils			2
full figures for @entity88 2011 entry are not yet available but 58.5 per cent of offers were to state school pupils			0
a spokesman said : ‘ the irony is that six out of the seven people offered law places at @entity99 were state - educated			2
' it ’s really important to understand that school attainment is the biggest factor affecting @entity1 ’s mix of students – not the way @entity1 selects them			0
’ @entity9 , which counts among its alumni foreign secretary @entity54 , private eye editor @entity108 , documentary - maker @entity110 and @entity112 , interviewed @entity113 , a student at @entity114 , @entity79 , in december			1
she is predicted to get a * s in her history , law and @entity27 literature a-levels , and now hopes to read law at @entity121			0
she said : ‘ it was during my interview that i finally realised subjecting myself to the judgment of an institution i fundamentally disagreed with was bizarre			0
‘ i spent my entire time at the university laughing at how seriously they were taking everything and felt like the only atheist in a gigantic monastery			0
’ @entity1 students took to @entity133 to vent their anger at @entity113 yesterday			0
one , going under the name ‘ jpspencer2 ’ , said : ‘ @entity7 has no idea what it is like to go to @entity1			1
her own stupid and narrow - minded opinions show why she would not be fit to go here			0

@entity7 , 19 , tells @entity9 it ' did not quite meet the standard of universities i will be considering '
she writes that she found ' obvious gap ' between minorities and white middle - class students ' embarrassing '
