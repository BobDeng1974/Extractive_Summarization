but their wishes were not passed on when the full register was transferred to credit reference agencies , who can sell it on to direct marketing firms			0
the national data protection watchdog , the information commissioner , has launched an investigation and last night issued a plea to councils affected to come forward			1
last night campaigners branded the scandal a ‘ serious breach ’ of individuals ’ privacy			1
@entity49 , acting director of @entity50 , said : ‘ if people want to vote , we have little choice but to hand over detailed information about ourselves			2
‘ so for millions of voters ’ details to have been wrongly been passed onto third parties , when they had explicitly stated that they did not want this to occur , represents a serious breach of councils ’ responsibility to protect their information			1
‘ councils have so far done little to reassure voters that this serious breach of their trust is being taken seriously			1
’ town halls sell on the register for as little as £ 5 a time to private companies , to customers including pizza delivery shops , estate agents and direct marketing firms - adding to the avalanche of junk mail			2
research published earlier this year showed more than 300 councils sold the register to 2,700 individuals and companies over the past five years			1
the councils involved made more than £ 250,000			2

the leak of data , which was blamed on a ' software error ' , could lead to families being deluged with a flood of unwanted cold calls , emails and letters badgering them to sign up for deals and agreements it is unclear how the long the problem has existed but @entity90 council said yesterday it had been using the software for ten years			1
the councils affected in @entity20 are @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			1

councils collect two versions of the electoral register			0
the full version is used for voting records and criminal investigations but its distribution is very limited			0
the edited register , which includes anyone who does not opt out , is available for sale to direct marketing firms			0
@entity90 council said the software which manages its list of voters had failed to work properly			0
it meant a large number of residents who had chosen to opt out of the edited register were not properly identified by the software when the list was passed on			0
the edited register can be sold on to marketing firms but the full version of the register should only be used for elections , preventing and detecting crime and checking applications for credit			0
@entity145 , @entity90 council ’s head of governance and improvement services , apologised to those affected			0
he added : ‘ as soon as we were made aware of the matter we took swift action to remove names and addresses from the public domain			0
‘ for a short time their names and addresses were incorrectly included on the edited register which means they may have received material from direct marketing companies during this time			0
‘ we have since provided the correct information to the various agencies that sell on this type of information and we believe personal details have now been removed			0
