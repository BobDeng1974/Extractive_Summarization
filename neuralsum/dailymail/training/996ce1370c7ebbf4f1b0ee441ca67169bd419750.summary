@entity0 insists his amazing record against @entity2 will count for nothing when the pair clash in the quarter - finals of the @entity6			1
@entity0 had to save six break points in the opening set of his fourth - round clash with @entity10 before easing to a 7 - 5 6 - 1 6 - 4 victory , while @entity2 saw off home hope @entity12 6 - 2 7 - 6 ( 7/3 ) 6 - 2 on sunday			1
third seed @entity0 has an 18 - 3 career record against @entity2 , who won three of their first four meetings but has lost the last 17 in a row			1
@entity0 insists his amazing record against @entity2 will count for nothing when the pair play ' it does n't matter what happened in the past			1
it is a different story this time , ' @entity0 said			1
' different moment for me , different moment for him			2
the way we arrive to that match is not going to affect what happens in the match			2
i 'm sure of that			2
' he 's a great player			2
i have success against him , but i have the chances to lose against him			2
i remember in 2012 i had a very , very tough match against him here ( in the quarter - finals )			1
i was close to being two sets to love down			2
he 's a player that is top level			2
' @entity0 admitted he thought of quitting during his second - round match with @entity48 @entity47 on wednesday , the @entity50 suffering from dizziness and nausea as he fell two sets to one behind			1
however , the nine - time @entity55 champion dug deep to win in five sets and looks to be working his way back to form and full fitness after the latter half of 2014 was ruined by a wrist injury and appendicitis			1
the 28 - year - old continues to play down his chances of winning a second @entity6 title , but added : ' it 's very special to be in the quarter - finals after a tough period of time for me , it 's a fantastic result			1
third seed @entity0 has an 18 - 3 career record against @entity2 , who won three of their first four meetings ' i am not a person that i am happy like this and that 's it			1
i try to play better and better every day			0
' if that happens , i hope to keep having chances for the next match			0
but today is a day to be happy the way that i improved my level of everything , all the things i have to do on court			0
today i was much closer ( to ) what i have to do to try to have success			0
' @entity2 , who lost to eventual champion @entity92 in the semi-finals here last year , has yet to drop a set but admitted he would still need ' something extra ' against @entity0			1
' i 'm feeling very good , ' the 29 - year - old said			1
' it 's been a great , great run so far			0
i just put myself in the best possible position right now			0
' i 'm going to have to add something extra again			0
that 's how the tournament is developing , just move forward , just be ready for it			0
' @entity2 hopes new coach @entity104 , who formerly worked with @entity106 's @entity105 , will provide an effective scouting report on @entity0 , and added : ' he is very good on that			1
@entity0 admitted he thought of quitting during his second - round match with @entity48 @entity47 ' he knows how to put up the plan before the match and how to prepare the player			1
that 's what i was looking for and what i needed			0
' the match with @entity12 was played on @entity117 and the @entity118 admitted he was amazed not to have played any of his four matches on @entity120 , the equivalent of @entity122 at @entity123			0
' i think the scheduling was ridiculous this year			0
not just from my side , but for many players , ' @entity12 said			0
' i do n't know who was in charge of the schedule			0
really , some of the matches i saw it was just like , ' wow '			0
' there was better news for the home fans when teenager @entity136 staged a brilliant comeback to beat @entity138 in five sets and become the first @entity118 man to reach the quarter - finals since @entity142 in 2005			1
@entity138 had caused the shock of the tournament by knocking out @entity145 in the previous round and carried on where he left off on @entity148 , winning the first two sets 7 - 5 6 - 4			1
@entity150 star @entity2 saw off home hope @entity12 6 - 2 7 - 6 ( 7/3 ) 6 - 2 on sunday @entity136 took the third set 6 - 3 and saved a match point in the fourth before winning it in a tie - break to force a decider which he eventually won 8 - 6 to send the partisan crowd wild - so much so that play was temporarily halted on the adjacent @entity120 due to the noise			1
the match in progress there between sixth seed @entity105 and 10th seed @entity165 was eventually won by @entity105 , who said : ' i heard a lot of noise and i had to ask my box what it was			1
' they told me @entity136 had just won and i am going to have to play a great match to win against him			2
' while 19 - year - old @entity175 said : ' it 's crazy			2
i do n't think it 's sunk in yet			0
' when i saw i had finally won the match it was incredible			2
it was the best feeling i ever had			0
to know the body could come back from two sets to love , knowing i have n't had matches , it 's just massive confidence			0
' i drew on my experience from @entity123 last year , coming back from two sets down against ( @entity189 ) @entity188			0
i knew i had the legs to do it			0
