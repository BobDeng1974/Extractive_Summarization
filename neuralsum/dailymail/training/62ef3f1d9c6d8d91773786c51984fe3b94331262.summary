by @entity0 explosive leaked emails have laid bare for the first time the depth of the bitter feud between @entity5 and @entity6			2
the emails , sent last week and obtained by @entity8 , reveal that the @entity10 ’s team think mr @entity6 is a ‘ nightmare ’			1
they prove the two are deeply divided over how to respond to the economic revival			0
and they indicate mr @entity5 is sick and tired of the shadow chancellor ’s refusal to obey his orders and ‘ stay on message ’			1
united front ? @entity5 with @entity6 are said to have had a number of behind - the - scenes rows publicly , the two men have always denied reports of long - running personal and political simmering tensions , and of heated behind - the - scenes rows between them and their rival camps			1
privately , the emails paint a very different picture and leave no doubt that relations between them are as bad as critics have long suspected			2
the emails were sent on wednesday in response to @entity37 governor @entity36 ’s announcement that the economic recovery had finally taken hold			1
‘ the glass is half full , ’ he declared			0
in its most optimistic set of forecasts for years in the latest quarterly inflation report , the @entity37 raised its outlook for growth and jobs and reduced its outlook for inflation			2
but the rosy forecast posed another test for relations between @entity5 and @entity6			2
the @entity10 leader is known to disagree with mr @entity6 ’s refusal to accept he was wrong to predict @entity56 policies would trigger a double - dip recession			1
and the shadow chancellor ’s continued use of his mocking ‘ flat - lining ’ gesture with his hand to @entity62 – when the economy is on an upward path – is regarded by mr @entity5 as another blunder			1
after the @entity37 announcement , mr @entity6 wasted no time in seizing control of @entity10 ’s official response , before mr @entity5 had the chance to do so			1
he told his senior adviser @entity70 to email mr @entity5 ’s aides , informing them of his response to the new forecast			2
mixed messages : extracts from emails sent by the @entity6 team , top , and the @entity5 camp , below around a dozen influential @entity10 figures received the roundrobin email			1
they included the former @entity84 mandarin @entity85 , mr @entity5 ’s chief economic adviser and a former aide to @entity88 , mr @entity6 ’s most powerful @entity10 critic			1
in the terse email , which echoes reports that mr @entity6 resents deferring to mr @entity5 , mr @entity70 wrote : ‘ could we get this out pls ? cleared at this end [ by @entity95 ] and essentially the same script as we had on gdp day the other week			1
’ mr @entity6 ’s 200 - word statement began : ‘ after three damaging years of flatlining			0
’ a phrase mr @entity5 now avoids			0
mr @entity6 went on to complain about the ‘ cost - of - living crisis ’ , called for a ‘ recovery that ’s built to last ’ and an ‘ economy that works for working people ’			0
less than 15 minutes later , mr @entity85 forwarded the email to fellow @entity5 loyalist , @entity105 , the @entity10 ’s head of strategy			1
in withering terms , mr @entity85 wrote at the top of the email : ‘ as an example of why we ’re having problems on @entity113 ( @entity115 ) messaging – this is his current three - part argument : cost of living ; @entity118 built to last ; @entity119 works for working people			0
’ mr @entity85 signed off with his own damning , one - word assessment of mr @entity6 : ‘ nightmare ’			0
he did not send the reply to mr @entity6 ’s office			0
ten minutes later , mr @entity105 replied to mr @entity85 in equally scathing when did built to last become a part of our thing ? ’ today ’s disclosure of the backroom sniping between @entity6 and @entity5 will do little to increase their low ratings in opinion polls			2
surveys show that voters are sceptical about the prospect of the pair running the economy			0
and the leaked emails are bound to be used by prime minister @entity62 and chancellor @entity139 to reinforce @entity141 claims that their @entity10 rivals can not be trusted with the nation ’s purse strings			1
a spokesman for @entity5 said last night : ‘ @entity6 was entirely right			0
after three damaging years of flatlining , there is no recovery for millions of families			0
‘ prices are rising faster than wages , and figures this week showed that people are on average £ 1,600 a year worse off since @entity62 came to office			0
