@entity2 said the service was ‘ wasting everyone ’s time ’ after candidates either failed to show up for interviews or even start a job once they were hired			1
she claims the government - run centres were simply helping the unemployed to ‘ tick boxes ’ so they could keep their benefits			1
mrs @entity2 , who co-founded a firm that sells electronic cigarettes , was initially pleased to receive almost 100 applications for an £ 8 - per - hour post as a warehouse packer			1
but of the seven jobseekers mrs @entity2 invited for an interview , only two showed up			1
and even the one candidate who was offered the position failed to turn up			0
last night she said her firm had stopped using the @entity4 to find staff after their ‘ nightmare ’ experience			1
‘ i found the @entity4 completely useless and other people in our industry say the same thing , ’ she said			2
‘ the applicants who applied were obviously just ticking boxes to keep their benefits			0
‘ it was a complete waste of time for them , the @entity4 and for us			2
‘ they were n’t interested in working for us , even when we showed an interest in employing them			0
’ problems began in august last year when the firm , ecigarettedirect.co.uk , placed an advert with a jobcentre in @entity54 , @entity55			0
after sifting through the candidates – some of whom came from as far as @entity59 and @entity60 – mrs @entity2 realised few had any intention of working			1
‘ by the end of the second day we had getting on for 100 applications from all walks of life – people with @entity69 , teachers , lecturers , some of them from quite a distance away , ’ she added			2
‘ we had one from @entity59 , another from @entity60 , but then it suddenly clicked with me that they were just filling in the forms to retain their benefits			0
’ unhappy : mrs @entity2 said her firm had stopped using the @entity4 to find staff after their ' nightmare ' experience			1
this is a file picture of a job centre under rules introduced last october , jobseekers can lose their benefits for up to three years if they repeatedly refuse to actively seek or be available for work			0
mr @entity88 said the government should make it less attractive for jobseekers to claim handouts			0
‘ when they ’ve got to get up at 8am , catch a bus to work and stay until 5pm , there is not much incentive to do so when they are managing well on various benefits , ’ she said			2
‘ it ’s too much like hard work			2
‘ they would be better off saying : “ look , i do n’t want to work , just give me the money ” , it would stop everyone wasting their time			1
‘ when we advertise privately we are n’t inundated with applicants , but they are of a much better quality – they actually turn up for an interview			0
’ a @entity4 spokesman said advisers work hard to help people off benefits and into a job			0
‘ it is only right that jobseekers should do everything they can to find work if they want to claim @entity122 ’ @entity123 and our advisers will work with them to ensure they apply for jobs which suit their skills and experience , ’ he said .			0
