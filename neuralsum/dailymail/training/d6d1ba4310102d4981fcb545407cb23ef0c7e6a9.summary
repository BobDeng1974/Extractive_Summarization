by @entity0 published : 18:42 est , 5 march 2014 updated : 05:51 est , 6 march 2014 the government was accused of caring more about ‘ bean - counting than national security ’ after it emerged the @entity5 employs more accountants than senior @entity8 officers			1
figures show the @entity5 has 2,490 civilian staff working in the ‘ @entity11 ’ , compared with 2,300 senior officers			2
these include generals , lieutenant generals , major generals , brigadiers and colonels put together			0
the @entity5 employs more accountants than senior @entity8 officers , figures reveal the number of accountants at the ministry has sparked outrage at a time when thousands of frontline servicemen are being axed amid crippling military cuts			1
the @entity5 , in the midst of one of the toughest cost - cutting drives in its history , is axing 30,000 troops , fleets of warships , warplanes and armoured vehicles to save £ 4.7billion and plug a £ 42billion black hole in its equipment budget			1
some 25,000 civil servants are also losing their jobs			0
shadow defence spokesman @entity41 , who uncovered the statistics , said : ‘ it sums up defence secretary @entity44 that the @entity5 has more accountants than senior @entity8 officers			1
' @entity44 cares more about bean - counting than defence ' : shadow defence spokesman @entity41 who uncovered the shocking figures ‘ these figures confirm suspicions that he cares more about bean - counting than he does about defence and @entity53 national security			1
’ commander @entity54 , a @entity55 veteran who is chief executive of the @entity56 – which campaigns to ensure the @entity57 have the right equipment – said : ‘ this seems to be excessive			0
there is a complete imbalance within the mod. to have so many accountants at a time when the numbers of officers and other ranks are being decimated seems astonishing			0
’ mr @entity41 has also learned that 820 military number - crunchers axed in the past three years have been paid £ 23million in compensation			1
around £ 2.8million was then spent on external accountants			2
mr @entity41 said : ‘ millions have already been wasted on botched procurement reform and a failed it project , and the public will be justifiably angry at yet another example of incompetence on @entity44 ’s watch as @entity44			0
’ the @entity5 insists it needed them to deal with complex contracts			2
yet the huge arsenal of financial expertise has still seen the @entity5 hit by a series of damaging blunders and accusations of waste			2
a withering @entity87 report earlier this year found the cost of @entity53 ’s biggest military programmes are £ 6.1billion over budget because wasteful defence chiefs have failed to live within their means			0
defence minister @entity93 said : ‘ the figures need to be seen in the context of the tough financial decisions made by this government			0
‘ we estimate that by 2021 - 22 we will have achieved cumulative savings of some £ 23billion as a result of reductions in service and civilian personnel and greater efficiency in the conduct of non-frontline activities			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity5 said : ' since 2010 , we 've cut the number of civilian finance staff by a quarter at the same time as balancing the budget and eliminating the £ 38 billion black hole in the defence budget inherited from the previous administration			1
' @entity5 finance staff make up just one per cent of our workforce , but the idea that we do n’t need them to manage a £ 34billion a year budget , some of the most complex procurement projects in the country , and the smooth - running of the @entity5 ’s bases and locations around the world is absurd			1

@entity5 in the midst of *massive* cost cutting drive , including axing 30,000 troops
