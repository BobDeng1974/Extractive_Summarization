by @entity1 reporter published : 02:19 est , 6 june 2012 updated : 06:05 est , 6 june 2012 delayed : new mother @entity2 gave birth to @entity4 , aged three weeks , in a hospital car park after a police road block delayed her journey a mother was forced to give birth in a dark hospital car park after her dash to the labour ward was delayed by two police road blocks			1
@entity2 and her husband @entity14 had to stop and answer officers ’ questions at one of the roadblocks despite the expectant woman being in the advanced stages of labour			1
when the couple finally made it to @entity24 at around 4am , mrs @entity2 did not have time to go inside as she started giving birth to son @entity4 when she got out of the car			1
the 26 - year - old said : ‘ my husband ran to press the intercom and asked for the midwife to come down			2
my legs gave way , i was on my knees on the tarmac and the baby ’s head came			0
‘ i was screaming and panicking			0
thankfully i had a towel with me because i was worried he was going to drop on to the tarmac			0
’ last night the new mother , who lives in @entity42 , @entity43 , told how their trip to hospital had been held up by the @entity48 roadblocks			2
they had been set up in the early hours of may 13 following a break - in at a shop in @entity52 , @entity43			1
all vehicles on the surrounding roads were stopped and their occupants questioned			0
mrs @entity2 had already been in the hospital a few hours earlier but was sent home because staff did not feel the birth was likely that night			1
however , in the early hours she was painfully aware that the arrival was imminent			0
when the couple set off from home they expected the journey to take half an hour			0
mrs @entity2 , who works for a coach firm , said they first had to wait until police had stopped talking to the occupants of a car in front			1
her husband told officers at the outset that they were hurrying to the hospital but they insisted on asking all of their questions			2
she added : ‘ when we got to @entity52 , we got stopped and my husband shouted out to the police officers that i was in labour			1
‘ they still stopped us and asked lots of details like my name , address , date of birth and place of birth			0
‘ they then asked what our purpose for being on the road was , even though i was clearly in labour – why else would we be on the road at four in the morning ? ’ on entering @entity94 , they came to a second roadblock , but this time police recognised the urgency of the situation and they were allowed through			2
unhappy : @entity2 said she was very frightened about the safety of her baby during the birth help on hand : a midwife from @entity24 helped mrs @entity2 give birth in the hospital car park mrs @entity2 said : ‘ we did get an apology from the police but i do n’t think it was much of an apology			1
‘ i was panicking and having to stop myself from pushing			0
i had had a child before and i knew what was coming			0
when we got to the hospital and i stood up from the car , i just could n’t go any further			2
’ a midwife alerted by mr @entity116 helped to deliver her baby in the car park			1
mrs @entity2 said : ‘ they had to cut the cord in the dark , i was very frightened			1
afterwards i realised people in the houses round about must have all been looking out of their windows wondering what was going on and why i was screaming			0
‘ i was terrified being on my own in the dark , it was n’t nice			0
we are so lucky everything is okay but what if there had been any complications ? what if the baby ’s cord had been wrapped around its head ? ’ mrs @entity2 ’s mother , @entity135 , later wrote to @entity48 to complain , telling them the delay could have had tragic consequences if there had been complications with the birth			1
the trained nurse said : ‘ i ’m very angry about what my daughter went through			0
every second counts if you ’re expecting a speedy delivery			0
‘ it should have been clear to the officer at @entity52 that @entity2 needed to be waved through immediately			1
’ responding to mrs @entity135 ’s complaint , inspector @entity151 , of @entity48 ’s community policing division , apologised for the incident			0
he said : ‘ it is a matter of great regret that our actions , intended to affect the arrest of those responsible for a break - in to a premises in @entity52 , resulted in a delay in your daughter getting to @entity24			1
‘ i offer my apologies if the delay in being stopped at the road block impacted on subsequent events and for any anxiety or distress caused to your daughter			2

@entity2 and husband were forced to wait in queue of cars while officers questioned each *driver*
police ignored their pleas to jump the road block and head for hospital
officers were *investigating* break - in at a shop in @entity52 , @entity43
when mrs @entity2 finally arrived at hospital she could *n't* make it further than car park and started giving birth
@entity194 had to run for midwife who delivered their *healthy* son , @entity4 , in the dark
