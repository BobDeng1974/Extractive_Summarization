@entity59 , who runs the village shop , told the @entity37 she was relieved to learn mr @entity3 would be the new lord of the manor			1
' i have heard of the @entity16 and it 's pretty well run , so it sounds like we wo n't have to worry , ' she said			2
' if he has run an estate nicely and properly maybe that will be better for us - maybe he will put those ideas into practice here			0
' she added that she will have to look him up so she would be able to recognise him			0
picturesque : the village of @entity50 , which includes a number of properties owned by the @entity24 @entity77 : the countryside around @entity50			2

on the festival ’s website , the ' eclectic and eccentric ' event is described as a ' dynamic summer festival disguised as a country fayre - a lovingly crafted , top notch , very @entity127 open air party , tailor - made for the whole family '			2

' @entity148 : girls sell flowers at @entity151 in @entity17 , which is hosted by mr @entity3 actress @entity152 - formerly of tv drama @entity153 - was also spotted among festival - goers			1

' it adds : ' @entity33 has consistently set its face against commercialisation of the beach			0
it is determined that families should continue to enjoy a peaceful day out in an unspoilt environment			0
' a source with knowledge of the sale , which is yet to be signed and sealed , told the @entity37 ' obviously different owners will do different things ' but denied mr @entity3 was pursuing any of the ' mad ideas ' that have circulated as rumours in the locality			2
