’ pre-eclampsia is a condition that affects some pregnant women during the second half of their pregnancy			2
early signs of the condition include high blood pressure and protein in the urine			0
as the condition becomes more advanced , further symptoms can develop			0
these include swelling of the feet , face and hands , a severe headache , vision problems and pain below the ribs			0
pre-eclampsia affects up to five per cent of pregnancies and is severe in about one to two per cent			0
it is more likely during a first pregnancy , if the woman has had it in a previous pregnancy , if the woman has a family history of the condition , if the woman is over 40 , or if she is carrying more than one baby			0
the condition is often mild but can lead to severe complications if it is not monitored and treated			0
the only way to cure pre-eclampsia is to deliver the baby , until this happens , some sufferers are given medication to lower their blood pressure			0
although most cases of pre-eclampsia do not lead to problems , there is a risk that the mother will develop fits - these can be life threatening for the mother and baby but are rare			2
occasionally , the condition can also cause the mother to suffer a stroke or organ failure			0
about six or seven women die from complications of pre-eclampsia in the @entity233 every year and about 1,000 babies die as a result of the condition - usually because of complications of early delivery			0
