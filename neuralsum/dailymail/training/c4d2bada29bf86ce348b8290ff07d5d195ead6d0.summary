by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ draper_rob @entity2 says that his team finally has the balls to win the title and that the new signings he has brought to the club will add to the character of the team , which was found wanting last season			1
@entity2 famously accused his side of lacking the right mentality to win the title when they slipped up losing 1 - 0 at @entity15 in the title run - in last march – refusing to say the words but writing ‘ balls ’ down on a notepad when asked what his side were missing			1
but now with the addition of some key players in @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and returnee @entity29 , @entity2 says that his team will have the right attitude travelling to venues like @entity32 on monday to meet newly - promoted @entity33 balls : @entity27 and @entity25 are ' men ' says @entity2 , and will help win @entity36 the league and it is the likes of @entity25 , who famously squared up to @entity40 and then argued with a number of @entity36 players in the @entity44 semi-final when playing for @entity45 , and @entity26 , the goalkeeper whose outstanding display in the same game helped defeat @entity36 , in whom @entity2 seems to place his confidence			1
‘ i have met so many wonderful characters in football but it is difficult to find one better than @entity25 , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ in the group , in the club , he ’s so nice , so funny			1
he ’s the kind of guy who at this moment probably knows ten words in @entity59 , but he speaks with everybody			2
i do n’t know in which language , i do n’t know how , but he understands everybody and everybody understands him			2
‘ they are laughing all the time and he is an amazing , positive guy in the group			2
after that , when he goes to the pitch , he wants to win matches and the fact that he played against @entity36 , a club that he was already connected to , as people were having the feeling he could come to us , and play against us and play the way he did for his club shows his character , as well as the goalkeeper ( @entity26 ) , who was the @entity36 goalkeeper ( on loan to @entity45 ) and he played against us and he killed us			1
opponent : @entity25 caused quite a stir when playing for @entity84 against @entity36 lasts season ‘ the group is different			1
@entity25 is a man , @entity27 is a man			1
it ’s not about individuals , it ’s about the team profile			2
@entity36 last season were closer to winning the title than the season before			1
then ( 2012 - 13 ) they finished third but only in the last game of the season			2
before that , fifth , 20 points behind			2
‘ if you generate in the team the feeling that you are not ready to compete for the title , you do n’t have that habit of playing every game for every point			2
in the last years , @entity36 became a good team in knockouts , in @entity106 and @entity108 competitions and so on			1
in terms of competitive marathons , being strong every week , every game , fighting in every condition , at home , away , in rain , cold , in hot sun , i found a team that lost the ingredients you need to be champions			2
last season , step by step , we recovered these			0
some boys , like @entity125 , @entity126 , for them it was something new to go in that direction			0
this season they are much more prepared			0
’ friendly : @entity25 's lack of @entity59 has done nothing to dampen his spirits , says @entity2 at £ 32m , @entity25 is the marquee signing and despite a disappointing @entity106 with @entity139 , the striker , who was born and raised in the remote town of @entity137 in north - east @entity138 , remains one of the most exciting additions to the @entity142 after his 35 goals at @entity45 last season as they won the league and reached the @entity44 final			1
having been part - owned by a business group , the 25 - year - old took his time to make it to the top , having been brought to @entity151 in @entity152 in 2006 before joining @entity45 but then being loaned to @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 and only becoming a regular at @entity45 two seasons ago			1
@entity2 believes he is now ready to become one of the dominant stars of the @entity142			1
i know he can be , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ he ’s on that level ( of the best players i have ever had )			0
he was in @entity152 at the age of 18 and i never look at him			1
so everybody was blind , including me			0
matured : after numerous loan spells @entity25 finally matured , which led to his @entity36 transfer ‘ he went to @entity45 and @entity169 was the superstar and he went on loan			1
after @entity169 was gone , they brought @entity172 , who was the superstar and he was on loan			0
i think he was always behind very important players but at the same time he was developing himself so that when he got the chance to go back to @entity45 he was even better than the previous ones			0
‘ he ’s still the guy that comes from a very small village , somewhere over the horizon			0
it ’s the kind of place that is difficult to find			0
he ’s still that guy			0
the way he behaves , the way he acts , the way he interacts , he ’s still that naïve , pure , simple , humble guy			0
at the same time , he ’s such a communicator , such a good group guy , such a happy man			0
he can establish a conversation and interact with somebody and he does n’t understand anything the other person is saying			0
but just because of his gestures and body language and his happiness , everybody likes the guy so much			0
‘ every time i say to him : “ do you need me to explain something in @entity198 ? ” and he ’s just : “ no ! i understand everything			0
” and i think in terms of the football , he does			0
in meetings , and when we watch videos , and my comments , i think the guy goes in the direction i want him to go			0
he ’s a clever guy			0
’ change : @entity2 said that his team did not always have the right attitude last season			1

@entity2 says his latest signings have improved @entity36 's attitude
@entity152 manager described @entity25 and @entity27 as ' men '
@entity2 says @entity25 is a *pleasure* to be around despite his *reputation*
