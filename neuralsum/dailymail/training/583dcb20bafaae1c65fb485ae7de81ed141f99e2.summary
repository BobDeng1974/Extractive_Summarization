for all the goals @entity2 have scored in @entity3 this season they have also managed to concede nine times			1
that ’s nine times more than @entity7 and a higher total than five other teams in @entity11 ’s top flight			2
they face @entity13 without arguably their best defender , @entity14 , so leaving @entity15 with a clean sheet will depend largely on what kind of night @entity17 has			1
the pantomime villain of @entity11 football has had many ups as downs in his seven years at @entity2			2
he was good enough to be one of former coach @entity27 ’s favourites and the @entity29 manager wanted to sign him at the start of last season			0
@entity2 centre back @entity17 has been sent off five times during his time in the @entity11 capital @entity35 international @entity17 will be tasked with marking @entity13 striker @entity36 @entity17 faced @entity13 , including former winger @entity37 , in the @entity38 in 2009 1			1
2007 - 08 - @entity2 v @entity39 2			2
2008 - 09 - @entity2 v @entity41 3			2
2010 - 11 - @entity2 v @entity42 4			0
2010 - 11 - @entity2 v @entity7 5			1
2011 - 12 - @entity45 v @entity2 he was also bad enough for @entity47 to relegate him to the bench during his last season at the club , as @entity51 emerged as the manager 's first choice partner for @entity14			1
@entity17 responded by publicly criticising @entity47 ’s treatment of @entity55 , and his manager issued a withering comeback			0
' @entity17 ’s problem has a name and that name is @entity51 , ' @entity47 said			0
' it ’s not easy being a 31 - year - old and being overtaken by a 19 - year - old kid			0
but that ’s the law of the jungle			0
@entity17 was undroppable , but not any more			0
' @entity17 had looked second best to @entity51 but they will play together with @entity14 out injured			1
even without @entity14 ’s exclusion , the @entity35 defender would have started after becoming close to undroppable once again			1
his speed of recovery helps @entity2 play a higher defensive line and his concentration levels are an asset alongside the occasionally renegade @entity14			1
he has also put his disciplinary problems behind him			0
@entity76 international @entity51 will partner @entity17 at the heart of @entity2 's defence @entity7 fans refer to @entity35 and @entity2 centre back @entity17 as the ' assassin ' @entity17 saw red for kicking @entity7 full back @entity82 during a @entity38 clash in 2011 @entity17 's usual centre back partner @entity14 will miss wednesday night 's game due to a calf injury @entity17 received a 10 - match ban for kicking @entity41 's @entity89 in april 2009 @entity47 and @entity17 did not see eye to eye during the @entity93 manager 's time at @entity2 it ’s been over five years since he kicked wildly at the head of @entity41 ’s @entity89 and received a 10 - match ban			1
saturday ’s @entity97 will no doubt bring out the worst in him as he tries to cope with @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , but so far this season he has responded to becoming , at 33 , the senior member of @entity2 's back four			1
@entity7 fans still refer to him as ‘ assassin ’ but in many ways his reputation as a hatchet man has always been a little exaggerated			1
he has shocked the sensitive nature of some of @entity3 ’s more refined watchers but alongside the likes of @entity111 and @entity112 , who clashed in this fixture during the @entity114 , he would be a long way down any ' hardman ' pecking order			0
he will have to marshal @entity2 ’s defence at set - pieces			0
it ’s been their weakness all season to the point where both @entity124 and @entity125 have been deployed in the six - yard box to compensate for a lack of height			0
set - pieces aside , wednesday 's game ought to be more straightforward than the upcoming meeting with @entity7			2
with @entity13 missing the two players who made them so difficult to contain last season , he is most likely to face @entity36 — dubbed ‘ the worst striker in @entity137 ’s top leagues ' by @entity138 this week			1
the label was more a comment on his poor goal return than his overall play but it has not gone unnoticed that the @entity143 has also faced @entity55 twice in international action and failed to score on either occasion			0
if @entity17 comes out on top against both the former @entity148 striker and @entity150 ’s @entity149 then @entity2 may just need @entity125 to break his @entity15 duck at the other end to take the three points .			2

@entity17 will be tasked with trying to stop @entity13 's @entity36
@entity2 will be without first choice centre back @entity14
@entity17 has been sent off five times during his time at @entity2
@entity7 fans still refer to @entity35 defender @entity17 as ‘ assassin ’
