by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 02:02 est , 26 july 2013 updated : 10:33 est , 29 july 2013 a hero @entity4 pilot going 500mph ' back - flipped ' his fighter jet at 250ft above the ground to avoid an inevitably fatal crash with a glider , it was revealed today			1
the daredevil 's lightning reflexes allowed him to force his own plane downwards and miss the other aircraft by ' a quarter of a second ' - or 100ft , an air investigation has found			1
his @entity16 jet was tearing through a valley in the @entity18 on a training exercise when he saw the tiny glider coming towards him			1
to avoid collision at terrifying speed the fighter pilot ' bunted ' , an aerobatic move where a plane is forced into an inverted loop and speeds away upside down			0
incredible : this @entity29 graphic shows how the terrific @entity4 pilot used lightning reflexes to avoid a glider , by flying his jet on its back just above the ground if he had decided to fly above the glider instead , the @entity4 's jet engine would have sent the light aircraft spiralling downwards into the ground			1
he had been travelling along the route of the @entity42 near the @entity43 and a report into the near miss described the risk of collision as ' high '			0
the glider pilot said the risk of collision was ' high ' , a @entity50 @entity49 report said			2
near miss : the @entity4 pilot spotted the glider ' at the very last moment ' when flying at 500mph along the route of the @entity42 near the @entity43			1
file picture the @entity4 pilot , based at @entity57 , was returning to base when he spotted the glider about 500m away			2
the report says : ' the glider pilot pulled up , gaining about 50ft in altitude as the @entity4 passed under and adjacent to him coming within an estimated 100ft vertically			2
' ' no other crew member in the formation saw the glider			0
' the incident took place near the village of @entity69 , as the fighter pilots avoided the @entity43			2
the @entity16 pilot said the glider may have been obscured by the canopy arch of his plane			1
a file picture of the @entity77 glider			0
the pilot was a civilian on a six - hour flight the glider , which has the registration number @entity82 , was four hours and 16 minutes into a flight lasting six hours and 42 minutes from the @entity85 gliding centre in @entity86 , @entity87			1
its civilian pilot was flying a single - seat , high performance @entity91 motor glider			1
the report said : ' no specific flight safety recommendations can be made ; both pilots were entitled airspace users in @entity98 [ uncontrolled ] airspace where the principle of ' see and avoid ' is used to prevent collision			0
' however , military crews must remain aware that light aircraft , including gliders , can and will operate in @entity98 , from low level below radar coverage , to higher altitudes			0
' however the report recommended that the @entity4 's flight recorders should be upgraded : ' the @entity4 flight recording capability runs out after 3hr and the incident occurred 3hr 20min into the sortie , so no visual record of the event exists			0
' it is recommended that the @entity4 fleet software is upgraded such that sorties are visually recorded in their entirety , regardless of sortie length			0
' watch full flight here			0

the near - miss took place in the skies above the @entity18
the @entity16 *tornado* saw and avoided the glider with split - second *manouevre*
*authorities* find neither pilot was at fault as the airspace is ' uncontrolled '
