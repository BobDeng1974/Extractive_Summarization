but he soon turned from victim to culprit when he grabbed one month old baby @entity18 from the back seat of the car belonging to @entity21 and @entity22 and refused to let go of her			2
finding it was locked , the @entity38 resident then opened the back door where the couple 's baby seat was positioned			1
safe : @entity21 and @entity22 stopped to help @entity9 who opened the back door of the car and tried to take one - month - old @entity18 from her seat write caption here ' he was just trying to grab her out of the backseat and i got out and grabbed him and told him let go of my daughter			2
and he would n’t let go , ' concerned father , @entity22 told @entity55			0
though ms @entity21 and her husband are finding it hard to forgive @entity9 for the attempted abduction , his behaviour can perhaps be better understood in the context of his own unfortunate circumstances			2
perilous : @entity9 was travellig along the @entity13 near @entity38 when he tumbled from the car and was hit by another though why he fell has not been explained by police sad : @entity9 is said to be struggling with the recent death of his toddler , @entity68 , at the hands of his ex-girlfriend 's boyfriend which may have prompted him to grab @entity18 ( pictured ) close call : the couple had not even got out the car when @entity9 got up from the ground and opened the rear passenger door in early august of this year , @entity9 's own 18 - month - old daughter @entity68 , died from head injuries and internal bleeding caused by a sequence of mysterious events at her mother , @entity84 's mobile home in @entity85 , @entity14			1

but @entity91 , who faces second degree murder charges , is blaming other bruises and injuries found on the victim 's body on random domestic accidents			1
according to @entity91 , the child fell out of a window in one instance and then fell off a table she was sitting on , but an autopsy suggests that her injuries were far more severe than those that could have been caused by such ' accidents '			0
though @entity9 and his ex- girlfriend , 22 , have been estranged for some time , and he had not been involved in taking care of @entity68 , @entity120 , two , and @entity121 , 3 , he is now seeking custody of the two remaining children			0

' as an unidentified friend sobbed on her shoulder , the woman continued suggesting that when he saw @entity18 in the back of the car , ' he just snapped			0
' but ms @entity21 responded : ' that 's no right to grab my child at all , it 's no right to grab anyone 's child			0
