@entity0 , 47 , was battling with a rare form of @entity2 , a cancer affecting the immune system suffering from a rare and aggressive form of cancer , @entity0 was given only weeks to live			1
with around 70 tumours throughout his body , doctors admitted they had almost run out of treatment options			1
but incredibly mr @entity0 , 47 , is now in ‘ complete remission ’ after he became the first person outside the @entity12 to receive a new tumour - busting drug			1
these pictures show how far the @entity2 had spread , with almost every area of his body showing clusters of tumours			2
but the second scan taken after only a few weeks on the @entity12 drug @entity21 shows an amazing improvement			1
all the tumours have been eradicated			0
the only dark spots visible on the scan show the normal functioning of his kidneys and bladder			0
the clinical trial at the @entity32 in @entity33 has been so successful that the drug has been made routinely available to other sufferers			0
now @entity37 patients with the same rare form of @entity2 can get the drug through the @entity40			1
@entity2 is a cancer which involves the lymph nodes , with the @entity37 treating around 1,500 new cases a year			2
mr @entity0 , an engine repair technician from @entity44 , said : ‘ i do n’t think i would be here today without that drug			1
‘ my specialist was so excited when he saw the results that he showed me them straight away			0
i had 60 or 70 tumours and they had gone			0
’ he had a rare form of @entity52 ’s called @entity51			1
brentuximab @entity21 targets this strain of the disease and can put patients into ‘ complete remission ’ when there would otherwise be few treatment options available			1
scans of mr @entity61 's body before and after treatment			2
the left shows him riddled with 60 - 70 tumours from @entity2			2
the right scan is 12 weeks after he became the first person outside the @entity12 to have a pioneering cancer drug			1
the black dots are his kidney and his bladder the drug @entity21 , the trade name for @entity21 , is administered through a drip into the arm every three weeks for up to a year			2
part of a new wave of targeted therapy , it homes in on a protein on the surface of cancer cells , where it sticks and delivers a drug that kills the cell			1
it is offered to patients who have no other options left , and trials show that in up to a third of cases it eradicates all signs of the cancer			2
it can still come back , but some patients have survived for more than three years , which has led to talk of a possible cure			0
@entity21 can have serious or possibly life - threatening side effects including a rare brain infection			0
it was given conditional approval by the @entity106 drug watchdog in 2012			0
mr @entity0 was diagnosed in 2001 and at first responded well to treatment , but in 2008 the cancer returned			1
he had a stem cell transplant , but once again the cancer returned and spread ferociously			0
given only weeks to live , he volunteered to take part in the clinical trial			2
‘ i knew i needed something pretty radical in order to survive , ’ he said			0
he began to show improvements within 24 hours of starting the drug and consultants at @entity32 , the largest specialist cancer centre in @entity106 , were amazed when they looked at his scans			2
after only 12 weeks of treatment they found his body was clear of tumours and now believe he is in ‘ complete remission ’			1
his doctor , dr @entity126 , a clinical research fellow in lymphoma at @entity32 , said : ‘ the drug can be administered rapidly and has few side effects			2
' this is probably the most impressive set of scans i ’ve seen			1
@entity0 was really up against it			0
he is in remission and we are increasingly confident about him			0
’ professor @entity140 , research and development director at @entity32 , said : ‘ stories such as this illustrate the value of clinical trials			0
individual patients can benefit and the knowledge we acquire allows us to move on to the next stage in developing the treatments of tomorrow			0
‘ i hope that more patients will ask their doctors about clinical trial opportunities			0
’ mr @entity0 went on to have a bone marrow transplant			1
this week he was discharged from his treatment at the @entity150			0
he said : ‘ i ca n’t thank the @entity37 and the hospital enough			0
they gave me back my life			0
’ mr @entity0 before his treatment , with approximately 60 - 70 tumours from his cancer			1
he had just weeks to live after all other treatments have failed a scan of his body after 12 weeks of treatment with the powerful drug @entity21			1
commenting on mr @entity0 ' scans , dr @entity126 , clinical research fellow in lymphoma at the @entity32 , said : ' this is probably the most impressive set of scans i 've ever seen ' mr @entity0 with his partner @entity166			1
he said : ' it feels like i 've got someone watching over me because after all of the treatment and tumours i 've had , i 'm still here ' mr @entity0 is now clear of the tumours and in remission			1
