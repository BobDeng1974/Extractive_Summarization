the prime minister , who insists he will catch the tube to @entity13 events , has also told every minister they must not take their family to events , even if they paid for the tickets themselves			1

earlier this week mr @entity2 confirmed he would go to @entity9 events on public transport and expected everyone to follow suit			1
but furious mps have said they would rather watch the @entity30 on tv than cram onto the underground or buses , which would leave them too grumpy to schmooze their guests			1
but the diktats have angered many , who feel that it will give off a bad impression			0
' this has caused a lot of ill - feeling and frankly some of us would rather not be going to anything at all , ' one senior minister told the @entity45			1
' the rules are unbelievably draconian			2
we 've basically been told we 're on our own and have to look after our guests with no official support and we 'll have to go by @entity11 as well			2
' i know they 're worried about how it will look if we 're seen to get special treatment but at the end of the day we 're supposed to be representing the government			0

' while touring @entity3 yesterday mr @entity2 confirmed he would be going to events on public transport and so should everybody else			1
told : instead @entity2 and his colleagues will have to cram onto the tube ' like everybody else ' the @entity9 flag was this morning flying on top of 10 @entity67 ' i will be using public transport and that is how i recommend [ everyone ] should travel '			1
' i now use the @entity11 , i drive my protection team mad in @entity73 by saying why on earth are we in the car , the @entity11 is quicker			0
when asked about whether he would use the ' @entity78 ' lanes , named after the limousines used in @entity80 at the height of @entity82 , he said : ' we are banished from using that terminology			0
' i went in a @entity30 lane , but it was not acting as a @entity30 lane when i came back from @entity87 on sunday			0
we were happily driving on it because everyone else was driving on it			0
' and @entity67 confirmed that almost without exception politicians will not go by car			1
' all ministers will be expected to travel to the games like everybody else , ' a no. 10 spokesman told @entity97 this morning			1

' last week it was revealed that at least 60 ministers and senior mps has been told to report for duty during the @entity30 and accompany vips to events			1
@entity2 alone will be taking executives from @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			0
they will have access to thousands of tickets bought at the taxpayers ' expense , including 350 in total for both opening and closing ceremonies			2
it came as an extra 1,200 troops were put on standby to protect the @entity9 as the fallout continues from the @entity125 fiasco			0
defence chiefs yesterday placed the servicemen and women – some recently back from @entity3 – on 48 hours notice to work as guards at @entity13			0
home secretary @entity130 and culture secretary @entity131 begged the @entity132 to provide additional military back - up amid concerns that beleaguered private firm @entity125 is still struggling to recruit security staff			2
