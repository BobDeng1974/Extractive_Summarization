the @entity1 family never knew what killed @entity3 in 1925 when the boy was only 17 , but they buried his body in @entity7 in a cemetery plot with his great grandparents			1
at least , they believed they did			0
when anthropologists dug up his coffin tuesday they found no body , only wooden boards , reports @entity18			1
a team of @entity21 anthropologists has worked to exhume and identify the bodies of students buried at @entity24 , where 100 students died between 1900 and 1952			2
discovery : @entity27 has lead a team of researchers and students from @entity21 and dug up @entity1 's casket , but found only planks of wood ( photos from @entity21 ) as the school 's campus was becoming a series of graveyards , @entity1 died ' under suspicious circumstances while escaping @entity40 twenty - nine days after arriving , ' according to court documents			2
the coroner at the time told the family there was no known cause of death , though a ledger noted he was ' killed on @entity49 , @entity50 ' the cemetery where he was buried has a document simply saying he was ' killed by train			0
' then in 2008 a death certificate was turned up at @entity40 during a state investigation saying that @entity1 died of a crushed skull but the cause was ' unknown			1
' that led anthropologist @entity27 up to @entity61 in @entity62 , where she hoped to answer questions of one more student 's death			0
the casket they found had the same thumbscrews as coffins found on @entity40 's campus , but when they opened it , all they found was wood			0
' layers of pieces of wood , ' says @entity27			0
' it was completely filled with wooden planks			0
' crosses : the campus at the school became a series of graveyards , as officials buried scores of boys who had died while attending , sending others like @entity1 home to families exhumed : anthropologists from the @entity21 , led by @entity27 , have worked to identify grave shafts and exhume bodies plots : the arrangement of graves on the grounds is at times orderly and other times haphazard , and @entity27 believes more graves are yet to be discovered forensics : university students assisted in the digs , which are intended to find human remains and investigate if possible the causes of death ' where is he ? ' said a shocked @entity7 state police corporal @entity110 at the graveside			1
the @entity113 school , which only closed in 2011 , has been described as a veritable hell of violence and torture , with with one staff member describing ' boy hunting ' to the @entity119 , where armed guards or convicts from the nearby prison known as ' dog boys ' tracked down escapees			1
back at @entity40 , surviving charges say they were lashed , and some alleged they were sexually abused and raped , though some former administrators have denied the abuse			0
that is where @entity1 fled from just before he was found lying by the train tracks with a fatal head wound , and someone worked to ensure the body was not discovered			1
' something was shipped up from @entity50 , and it was buried , and someone believed it was @entity1 , ' @entity27 said later			2
when the school sent the coffin to his grandmother back in 1925 , no one apparently checked the contents inside before a @entity143 ceremony was held and he was buried			1
@entity27 has contacted relatives of @entity1 's , and one cousin , 61 - year - old @entity145 , who is the granddaughter of @entity1 's mom 's sister , has provided dna samples researchers hope match to use to identify @entity1 if his body is found			2
' their interest lies in justice being served , ' said @entity155 .			0

@entity1 , 17 , *disappeared* from the @entity24 , a *reform* school , in 1925 and turned up dead by the train tracks
the school shipped a coffin back that was buried after a @entity143 service
officials found a death certificate in 2008 , stating the cause of death was a crushed skull , and the body was dug up tuesday
boys often escaped the school , only to be hunted down in what some former school staff called ' boy hunting , ' though others have denied many of the abuse *claims*
