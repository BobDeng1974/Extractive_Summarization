by @entity0 comedian @entity1 has launched a £ 300,000 defamation claim against one of the women who exposed @entity5 as a paedophile			1
the 70 - year - old claims that @entity9 's allegations that he assaulted her nearly 40 years ago have cost him a small fortune in cancelled bookings			1
@entity1 was arrested after cancer sufferer @entity12 , 55 , claimed on television that he groped her in @entity5 's dressing room after appearing on the shamed @entity17 's tv show @entity16 in 1974 when she was 15			1
@entity9 in yellow sitting behind @entity1 when he appeared on the @entity16 tv show @entity16 hosted by @entity5 miss @entity9 's testimony against @entity20 was one of the key factors in triggering the investigation into his past			1
she spoke on camera in the @entity28 documentary which first revealed @entity5 's abuse , focusing on how he preyed on her and fellow pupils at @entity32 approved school for girls in @entity35 , @entity36			0
but @entity1 – who is furious that police have not decided whether to charge him – claims that her additional claims that he molested her are untrue and defamatory , and have cost him more than £ 300,000 in cancelled theatre bookings			1
in a highly unusual case , he has lodged a legal claim at the @entity42 , detailing repeated occasions when he claims she blackened his name as a paedophile			2
@entity1 was first arrested last november by the @entity48 squad which is investigating claims of historic sexual abuse sparked by the @entity52 revelations			1
he was rearrested in april over further allegations and last month police handed a file on his case to the @entity57			2
@entity9 ( left ) was sexually abused by @entity5 and went on to claim she was groped by @entity1 ( right ) - an allegation he has denied in his claim , he maintains his innocence of all charges , describing himself as ' a famous comedian and entertainer who has been active in showbusiness for over 40 years '			1
the father of five says miss @entity9 's attacks on him began in the @entity28 documentary exposure : the other side of @entity5 , which was broadcast in october 2012			0
in it , she said : ' i was horribly , horribly humiliated by @entity1 , who had a very bad attack of wandering hands and had groped me , and i did n't like him because he smelled like my step - father and it frightened me and freaked me out , and i rebuffed him and he humiliated me in front of everyone in the dressing room			1
' @entity1 , who lives near @entity78 , @entity79 , denies any such sexual assault at the @entity16 recording , humiliating or frightening her , or being a paedophile			1
his claim also says miss @entity9 was libelling him when she told a @entity16 journalist : ' other guests on the show clearly saw girls and , well , kids , male and female , as being there to be used			0
@entity9 was just one of the hundreds of @entity5 victims who came forward to tell police about his crimes ' i had a famous person who would try , he smelled awful , he smelled of sweat and alcohol and it made me heave just to be near him , so i certainly did n't want him to do anything to me			0
' @entity1 also complains that @entity12 published defamatory claims on an internet blog in which she wrote of visits with schoolmates to @entity5 's dressing room at the @entity16 over a period of several weeks			1
she wrote she met a number of celebrities , saying : ' of those who had similar tastes to @entity5 – a liking of under - age girls – i can only recall vague disgust and horror			2
' one particular celebrity , a very popular comedian of the time , whom i shall simply refer to as “ f ” , absolutely stank of booze and sweat			2
' his hands wandered incessantly – he had absolutely no qualms about any one of the girls seeing what he was doing to any of the others			0
the fact that we sat in his dressing room with him , drinking vodka or @entity129 rum whilst he blatantly selected which girl to humiliate amazes me			0
' i refused " f " because getting anywhere near him made me heave			0
' and in an autobiography produced to be read on kindle - type devices , she said the comedian referred to as " f " ' was furious that i dared refuse him – he made an exceptionally cruel remark about my lack of breasts by way of getting back at me for refusing him			1
' so that everyone could hear , he said loudly , " i would n't touch you anyway , you 're a * * * less wonder ! "			0
everyone laughed whilst i burned with humiliation			0
' @entity1 's claim says he is easily identifiable because he was a popular comedian with the initial f , and miss @entity9 had already named him on tv			1
he denies encouraging under - age girls to drink alcohol while choosing which to humiliate			2
he says he is due aggravated damages because miss @entity9 sought a huge audience for her claims ' when , if there were any truth in her allegations , she should have reported them to the police '			2
he also claims she had refused to retract or apologise for the claims , despite his public denials – and seeks an injunction barring her from slurring him in future			0
miss @entity9 , of @entity165 , @entity166 , was diagnosed with bowel cancer two years ago			0
she is a qualified legal secretary , but has rarely worked because of depression and anxiety			0
last night , she could not be reached for comment			0
