the @entity2 ( formerly miss @entity2 ) at the party which marked the @entity48 of the new @entity49 in @entity50 in 1959 wearing the tiger bracelet @entity8 and @entity2 's love affair and marriage - which forced his abdication as @entity55 - shocked the nation a @entity44 's spokesman said : ' the @entity58 has been a highlight of 20th century jewellery design since it first appeared in 1928			1
' the rarity of these pieces is enhanced by the story behind their ownership – two romantic tales where they became symbols of love through the act of giving			0
@entity3 , wife of @entity72 , wearing both the broach and bracelet ' @entity8 was @entity55 for less than a year when he abdicated in 1936 to marry @entity2			1
' living in @entity12 , together they created a remarkable collection of avant - garde jewels that defined the style of the 1940s and 1950s			2
' these pieces were bought by the @entity9 and @entity2 from @entity1 between 1956 and 1959			2
' in the legendary sale of her collection in 1987 in @entity28 a total of seven @entity83 pieces by @entity1 were offered , including the two tiger pieces now presented for sale			2

few could have imagined , as the 20th century dawned , that an @entity117 socialite would prove the cause of the biggest constitutional crisis the @entity120 has ever faced			0
but @entity2 was no ordinary socialite and her future husband @entity8 , no ordinary king			2
the pair met in january 1934 and twice - divorced @entity2 and the then @entity8 swiftly fell in love			2
at first the relationship raised few concerns , @entity8 was notorious for his affairs with society ladies , but that all changed when @entity129 died on january 20 , 1936			0
when , the next day , the new king - emperor chose to watch the proclamation of his accession in the company of @entity2 , it became clear that he intended to marry her			0
this precipitated a crisis , firstly because the political establishment considered a twice - divorced woman an unsuitable consort , and secondly , because @entity8 was now head of the @entity141 , which at the time , did not allow marriages between divorcees			0
@entity8 suggested a morganatic marriage which would have prevented @entity2 becoming @entity145 , but the prime ministers of the @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 rejected the plan			0
by early december , the true nature of @entity2 's relationship with the @entity55 had become public knowledge and she fled the country			2
