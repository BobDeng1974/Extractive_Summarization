@entity0 has slammed @entity2 's @entity1 , the new venue of the @entity4 , comparing it to ' a car boot sale ' , ' an aircraft hangar ' and ' a shopping mall '			1
@entity0 is the reigning champion , having turned on the style last year at the @entity9			1
but despite a productive day on the baize , defeating first - round opponent @entity11 4 - 1 before knocking off @entity12 4 - 2 in the second , he was scathing about the surroundings			2
@entity0 has slammed @entity2 's @entity1 and compared it to ' a car boot sale ' ' i do n't like the new venue here at @entity2 , i thought the old one at @entity9 was one of the best venues i ever played at so i was gutted to see it go , ' the five - time world champion told @entity20			1
' you would n't look forward to playing in these conditions with the 128 players , the venues ca n't really handle it and it is like a car boot sale			0
' you just have to scrummage your way through the first two or three rounds and put up with the sub-standard conditions			2
' i had played here and knew what sort of venue it was , it is like an aircraft hangar , the atmosphere is not as great and the acoustics not as good			2
@entity0 revealed he does n't like the @entity2 venue and believes the atmosphere is n't the best ' you ca n't take it too seriously out there			1
there is so much going on it is really difficult to concentrate on your shots			0
' it is like playing in a shopping mall , there are people just walking around all over the place , getting up , it is hard to get your head around			0
' it is hard to focus on your game			0
but what it means is you do n't take it seriously because if you do it would really annoy you , so you just smash a few balls around			0
