@entity0 says that @entity1 see ' a lot of potential ' in uncapped @entity4 prop @entity3			1
the @entity6 - born tighthead qualifies for @entity1 through his grandmother , and he has proved an important part of @entity4 's ongoing push for @entity11 play - off status this season			1
and the 22 - year - old has now been invited to train with the @entity1 squad by head coach @entity15 as they go into the final stages of their @entity18 campaign			1
@entity4 tighthead prop @entity3 ( top right ) has been called up to train with the @entity1 squad ' his scrummaging is outstanding , but he is also a skilful player as well , ' @entity1 assistant coach and defence specialist @entity0 said			1
' @entity3 is a big kid , and i have seen him play			1
the scrum at @entity4 has been going excellently recently , so we have brought him in			1
' he is a young man who is coming from a great environment at @entity4 which prides itself on hard work , and we would like to think we are a similar sort of environment			2
' it 's a case of trying to get the best players playing for us , and we see a lot of potential in this lad			2
' @entity3 , who weighs in at more than 20 stone , played @entity37 rugby for @entity38 and @entity39 before he was snapped up by @entity4 , and he could easily push for a @entity41 squad place with @entity1 later this year if he continues to impress			1
@entity1 coach @entity0 says that @entity1 see ' a lot of potential ' in uncapped @entity4 prop @entity3 experienced @entity44 hooker @entity43 , meanwhile , has been called into the @entity18 squad and reported for duty at @entity1 ' training base on monday			1
@entity1 , despite losing their opening @entity18 game to @entity51 , have given themselves a fighting chance of landing a third title in four years following successive away victories over @entity55 and @entity56			2
reigning champions and unbeaten title favourites @entity59 are next up in five days ' time , and @entity0 is under no illusion how big a task will be presented by @entity63 's team			2
' we have looked at our opponents , and we are coming up against the best team in @entity65 , the form team in @entity65 , ' @entity0 added			2
the 22 - year - old was invited to train with the @entity1 squad by head coach @entity15 ' they have got two brilliant half - backs , for a start , who have got great tactical brains			1
' they have a strike - runner on the outside in @entity78 who maybe the best defensive winger in the northern hemisphere			0
he is magnificent in picking up interceptions , and we have to keep our eye on @entity85			0
' the forwards are well - drilled and a cohesive unit , and play with a lot of passion and aggression , and they have got excellent coaches			0
' these are the big games you get excited about , and big - time players rise to the challenge			0
' two key areas that @entity1 will need to perform strongly in are the lineout , where @entity59 will be spearheaded by their captain @entity98 , and shackling an impressive new @entity100 midfield combination of @entity101 and @entity102			2
@entity3 played @entity37 rugby for @entity38 and @entity39 before he was snapped up by @entity4 @entity0 said : ' they ( @entity98 and @entity105 ) are a very experienced second - row pairing			1
' having worked with @entity98 , he is a very wily operator and a guy who i have huge respect for			0
' our guys will have their work cut out at lineout time , but they have already been in this morning having meetings and looking at the different structures			0
they know we are in for a challenge in that area , and i am sure they are up for it			0
' and i have been very impressed with them ( @entity59 centres )			0
' i knew more about @entity101 , having watched @entity124 more than @entity125			0
but @entity102 is a big physical guy , and @entity101 has a cutting edge on the outside			0
it 's important we do n't give them any space whatsoever			0
