@entity0 were the beneficiaries of a decision that @entity3 described as the ' worst penalty decision ever ' in their clash at home against @entity8			1
the hosts took the lead through a @entity12 penalty in the 17th minute but their visitors were left furious after referee @entity14 deemed that @entity15 handled the ball in the penalty area when it seemed to hit him in the face			1
an excellent sliding pass from @entity0 forward @entity20 released @entity21 in the 16th minute and as the frontman checked back , @entity8 defender @entity15 slid in and was adjudged to have handled			1
@entity0 were the beneficiaries of a decision that @entity3 described as the ' worst penalty decision ever ' the ball hits @entity15 ( right ) in the face but @entity14 gave @entity0 a penalty replays , however , indicate that the ball struck @entity15 's head and @entity14 , the referee , appears to have made a very poor decision			1
that was certainly the view of @entity8 legend @entity3 on @entity34			2
the @entity36 presenter tweeted : ' worst penalty decision ever as @entity14 gives handball against @entity8 's @entity15 at @entity38 when it him in the face			1
' after the official awarded @entity0 another penalty , which @entity12 scored to make it 2 - 0 , @entity3 added : ' @entity14 strikes again ! two ludicrous penalty decisions ! wait until you see some of the refereeing decisions on @entity36			1
' i reckon some of them may have been celebrating too hard last night			2
' @entity8 players surround the official after @entity0 were given a penalty in the first half @entity8 manager @entity51 believes video technology would have prevented his side conceding two penalties in their 2 - 2 draw at @entity0			2
' i see what everyone sees , things happen very quickly , ' said @entity51 after the match ' it is going to fuel the debate again about use of technology because we ( the @entity8 dugout ) have the benefit of being able to see it in a few seconds and know what has happened and it is unfortunate to have to deal with two occasions like that in the first half			0
' i am not going to go down the route of being ultra-critical because at the end of the day the game could be a lot easier by utilising what is available to us , but we do n't			0
' on @entity79 's penalty he added : ' it hit his hand but it is how the rules are interpreted and whether there is a level of consistency			2
referee @entity14 awarded the controversial penalty hapless referee @entity14 started the new year as he refereed throughout the old one by awarding @entity0 a penalty when the ball appeared to hit @entity8 's @entity15 on the head as he slid to block @entity21 's cross			1
@entity14 clearly thought that the ball had hit the arm of @entity15 but replays showed that was not the case			1
referees are told that it can be understandable if they miss incidents but it is not acceptable to give something that has not happened			0
' you can see from the player 's reaction it is unintentional but i fully accept it hits his hand			0
' there were other occasions at both ends where you could say if that one is given why are n't the others			0
' this is the problem the game has			0
it exposes human beings to making errors - that is not a criticism of the officials but we could make it much easier for everyone concerned if technology was utilised			0
' it takes a couple of seconds			0
even when the whistle has gone and players are remonstrating with the officials it could be reviewed instantaneously			0
' it ( introduction of technology ) is not inevitable but do i think it should be there , yes			0
' @entity12 stepped up and scored the penalty against @entity8 that should never have been @entity3 was incredulous after the award of @entity0 's first penalty @entity3 vented his frustration after @entity14 awarded another penalty for @entity0 , which @entity12 scored @entity3 joked ' some of them ( referees ) may have been celebrating too hard last night '			1
