click here to see our brilliant @entity1 including @entity4 's opening goal for @entity5 @entity5 are the unlikely early leaders of their @entity8 qualifying group after first - half finishes from @entity4 and @entity11 eased them to victory over the @entity13 to make it two wins in as many matches			1
a 2 - 0 scoreline may not be one to write home about against a side ranked 179th in the world , and only going in one direction on this evidence , but the result is a significant one - taking @entity26 's side to the @entity28 summit and giving them their best start to a campaign since 1968			1
both goals came inside 20 minutes and although a mountain of possession did not yield a third , goalkeeper @entity34 ensured it would be a blemish - free night at @entity35 with his superb penalty save from @entity37			1
@entity4 wheels away in celebration after his sixth minute strike put @entity5 1 - 0 up against the @entity13 @entity4 celebrates with teammates after putting his side 1 - 0 up early on in the match the @entity13 ' team watch on as @entity4 wheels away in celebration during the @entity28 match @entity5 : @entity34 , @entity48 , @entity4 ( @entity49 56 ) , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 ( @entity54 67 ) , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity11 ( @entity58 84 ) subs not used : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity48 , @entity65 , @entity66 goals : @entity4 6 , @entity11 20 booked : @entity50 36 @entity13 : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 ( @entity72 90 +1 ) , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity37 , @entity75 , @entity76 ( @entity77 82 ) , @entity78 , @entity79 ( @entity80 75 ) subs not used : @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity80 , @entity88 booked : @entity89 15 , referee : @entity91 @entity4 got the ball rolling in the sixth minute with his fifth international goal and @entity11 - who grabbed the winner against @entity95 last month - doubled the advantage with a smart finish from @entity50 's pass			1
a trip to top seeds @entity102 awaits on tuesday and a positive result there could yet raise hopes of a first ever appearance at the @entity106 for the green and white army			0
the home fans , reduced to little over 10,000 by ongoing redevelopment work at the national stadium , were given a slice of pre-match inspiration with an on - pitch appearance by @entity115 boy and @entity117 super bantamweight world champion @entity116 in the build - up			0
@entity116 's walkabout upped the atmosphere considerably - no easy task with two stands demolished - and the home side responded with a flurry of early jabs at their opponents before @entity4 landed the first clean blow			1
the @entity129 man 's night almost ended before it had begun , with the centre - half requiring treatment having thrown himself at the far post in pursuit of a @entity136 free - kick			2
@entity4 's next involvement , this time from @entity136 's corner , saw him react quickest to @entity52 's flick on before rattling a crisp first - time effort into the net			1
having settled quickly the green shirts were soon pouring forward , @entity53 and @entity57 making inroads down the flanks and @entity56 thrusting through the middle in an advanced role			0
their second goal almost came from the unlikely source of right - back @entity48 , who met a corner with an audacious attempt off the instep , but it was @entity11 who did the business			2
@entity50 was the creator , cutting in and looking for his striker 's run with a measured ball through the middle			0
@entity11 finished coolly , ghosting past the @entity13 backline and touching into the bottom corner			2
@entity11 doubled @entity5 's lead in the 20th minute , when his deft touch at the front post beat the keeper @entity11 pumps his fist in celebration after the goal that secured @entity5 's win - and continued their 100 % win record @entity34 came to @entity5 's rescue when he saved a penalty from @entity37 10 minutes before half - time the @entity175 forward should have had another moments later when @entity57 's cross found him unmarked six yards out but @entity178 goalkeeper @entity68 stuck out a glove to make a fine reaction save			1
the @entity13 were living down to their reputation , sitting deep and inviting @entity5 forward , with @entity56 having taken up residence at the edge of the area			2
the skipper twice lofted over when his chance came but his movement was leaving the @entity13 chasing shadows			0
@entity11 was also a constant threat , tempting @entity70 into a crude challenge and later leaving him for dead to head another great chance just wide of the post			2
@entity57 ( left ) and @entity71 ( right ) clash as they fight to win the ball during the @entity28 match at @entity35 @entity198 ( left ) attempts to beat @entity13 ' @entity199 ( right ) down the wing at @entity35 @entity199 ( left ) tackles @entity53 ( right ) during the @entity202 qualifier at @entity35 , @entity115 on saturday night it took the visitors 35 minutes to muster a meaningful attack and , improbably , it earned them a penalty			1
@entity50 was the guilty man , needlessly tugging @entity78 's shirt as the chased @entity75 's chipped pass			0
@entity37 struck the spot - kick well but @entity34 flung himself the left and pushed the ball against the post one - handed , his second penalty save in a week following a similar effort for @entity215			1
the second half began with a familiar pattern , the home team dominating posession but finding one too many white shirts blocking their route to goal			0
@entity136 and @entity56 were close to passing their way round the roadblock on several occasions but the islanders just about held their line			0
@entity11 pumps his chest after his important goal sealed the win for @entity5 in @entity115 @entity5 manage @entity26 watches on as his side fought their way past the @entity13 on saturday night @entity58 ( left ) fires the ball past @entity70 during the @entity8 qualifier between @entity5 and the @entity13 with little or no forward threat @entity26 gave @entity4 a breather with less than an hour gone , @entity236 's @entity235 earning a competitive debut in his place			1
a third goal remained elusive , @entity57 dragging wide following a swift break by @entity56 and @entity53 slotting wide with the goal at his mercy			0
with little more than 20 minutes to go the mercurial @entity54 was given the chance to change that , replacing his former @entity248 team - mate @entity53			2
the @entity250 winger injected an element of unpredictability , but in truth the momentum had largely evaporated			0
@entity57 came closest to putting the icing on the cake with nine minutes left , drilling a long - range free - kick low towards the bottom corner and drawing an ungainly sprawling save from @entity260 .			0

@entity4 opened the scoring in the sixth minute to put @entity5 1 - 0 up
@entity11 doubled their lead after 20 , when his deft touch beat the goalkeeper at the near post
@entity34 came to the rescue 10 minutes before the break when he saved a penalty
@entity5 's win means they continue their 100 % win record in @entity8 qualifiers
