by @entity0 published : 05:58 est , 8 february 2013 @entity2 : 10:02 est , 8 february 2013 @entity4 president @entity3 has fired a top @entity4 @entity6 official after publicly ridiculing him on a visit to the winter olympics site			1
in an attempt to stamp his authority on the event he sacked @entity12 , 42 , vice-president of @entity4 's @entity6 committee , after becoming annoyed that the ski - jump was not on schedule			1
the current price tag for the @entity17 is 1.5 trillion rubles ( $ 51 billion ) , which would make them the most expensive games in the history of the @entity21 - more costly even than the much - larger @entity21 held in @entity22 and @entity23			1
sacked : @entity4 president @entity3 has fired a top @entity4 @entity6 official after publicly ridiculing him when he found out the ski - jump was not on schedule fired : mr @entity3 sacked @entity12 , 42 , vice-president of @entity4 's @entity6 committee , pictured last month , after becoming annoyed that the ski - jump was not on schedule pressure : next year games are even more costly than even than the much - larger @entity21 held in @entity22 and @entity23 the games at the @entity32 resort of @entity33 are considered a matter of national pride and one of @entity3 's top priorities			1
@entity3 's decision came after he scolded officials over a two - year delay and huge cost overruns in the construction of the @entity33 ski jump facilities			1
the @entity4 official involved , @entity44 , had a company that was building the ski jump and its adjacent facilities before selling its stake to state - owned @entity49 last year			1
during his tour of @entity6 venues , @entity3 fumed when he heard that the cost of the ski jump had soared from 1.2 billion rubles ( $ 40 million ) to 8 billion rubles ( $ 265 million ) and the project was behind schedule			1
unamused : @entity4 's president @entity3 , centre , walks with deputy prime minister @entity57 ( third left ) during a tour of @entity6 venues yesterday update : mr @entity3 visits the @entity6 village			1
the 2014 @entity63 , which open one year from today , are expected to cost $ 51 billion , making it the most expensive @entity21 in history bitter : @entity3 's decision came after he scolded officials over a two - year delay and huge cost overruns in the construction of the @entity33 ski jump facilities so a vice president of the @entity74 is dragging down the entire construction ? well done ! you are doing a good job , ' @entity3 said wednesday , seething with sarcasm			1
deputy prime minister @entity57 told reporters thursday that @entity3 had recommended that the @entity81 fire @entity12 , one of its six vice presidents			1
' as far as @entity12 is concerned the president voiced his decision yesterday : people who do n't make good on their obligations at such a scale can not head the @entity6 movement in our country , ' he said			1
most countries that host the @entity21 use public funds to pay for most of the construction of the sports venues and new infrastructure like roads and trains			1
the @entity4 government , however , has got state - controlled companies and tycoons to foot more than half of the bill			2
assurances : despite these setbacks , @entity4 officials today went to great lengths to reiterate that everything in @entity33 was now on schedule priority : the games at the @entity32 resort of @entity33 are considered a matter of national pride and one of @entity3 's top priorities both the companies and the tycoons understand the importance of maintaining good relations with @entity3 , who has a lot of prestige riding on the success of the @entity33 games			1
@entity57 said the costs constantly increased for the ski jump project because @entity12 's company did not properly check the land and , as a result , picked a geologically challenging plot			2
' his calculations failed , ' @entity57 said			0
the @entity81 was quoted by @entity4 news agencies as saying that @entity12 's future can only be decided by a session of its executive committee			2
despite these setbacks , @entity4 officials went to great lengths to reiterate that everything in @entity33 was now on schedule			0
' as @entity74 members and we stated yesterday , it is already clear that we have succeeded with this immense and possibly the most immense project in @entity4 's modern history , ' @entity57 said			2
tour : mr @entity3 talks to journalists as he visits the @entity149 centre ' @entity147 ' guided tour : @entity3 rides in a bus with the head of the @entity17 organising committee @entity154 taking a cue from @entity3 , however , @entity4 officials sought to play down the high costs			1
@entity57 said the government spent no more than 100 billion rubles ( $ 3 billion ) on the @entity6 venues and the immediate infrastructure			2
the government has spent a total of $ 13 billion so far , and expects to spend about $ 18 billion overall before the games begin , @entity57 has said previously			2
on thursday , @entity57 said it was unfair to compare @entity33 's budget to that of previous olympic games because @entity4 organizers had to build most of the vital and costly infrastructure that was needed - roads , railways , tunnels , gas pipelines - from scratch			2
no @entity4 officials went near the topic of possible corruption , even though @entity4 business is notoriously plagued by it			0
@entity4 last year ranked 133rd out of 176 in @entity179 's @entity178 , along with countries such as @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183			2
vow : @entity3 vowed today @entity4 would justify expectations when it hosts the @entity63 in @entity33 in one year , after ruthlessly firing an official blamed for delays in building infrastructure race is on : @entity4 president @entity3 , left , and @entity74 president @entity189 press a symbolic button to mark one year to the start although there were no documented cases of corruption directly linked to @entity6 construction in @entity33 , a dozen officials from the @entity33 government have been slapped with charges of corruption in the past year			1
@entity57 and @entity33 officials insist that they 're keeping the situation under control and that no money is being stolen at @entity6 sites			0
@entity33 organizers also sought to assuage fears that the @entity207 may fall victim to a warm and snowless winter - or a howling blizzard			0
temperatures at @entity33 's @entity212 ski resort hovered at 59 degrees @entity214 ( 15 degrees @entity213 ) on thursday , and reached 66 degrees f ( 19 c ) in the coastal city of @entity33			0
that 's after a cold snap the previous week in which athletes competed in test events amid snowstorms as temperatures dipped to 20 degrees f ( -6 c )			0

organizers said about 40 percent of the tickets would be priced under 3,000 rubles ( $ 100 )			0
the total number of tickets put on sale was not disclosed			0
in a bid to combat ticket scalping , @entity33 organizers said they would limit the number of tickets that can be bought by one person			0
for the most popular events , such as the opening ceremony and top ice hockey games , the limit would be four tickets per person			0
@entity33 organizers will also require visitors to apply for a special spectator pass without which they will not be able to access the venues .			0
