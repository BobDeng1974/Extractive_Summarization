when @entity1 first introduced @entity2 to the world , he quipped that luckily their newborn had inherited his mother 's looks , to which @entity8 replied ' i 'm not sure about that '			1
but judging by yesterday 's snaps of @entity14 prince george alexander louis of @entity16 , who put on a perfect display of royal etiquette on one the biggest day of his life so far , he really is the spitting image of his mother as baby			2
as the former @entity8 carried her son out of the service , dressed in a handmade replica of @entity31 @entity30 ’s daughter ’s christening robe , it was impossible to miss the resemblance between the pair			1
and it is n't just his mother 's looks that the youngster has acquired			2
according to aides , there was n’t ‘ even a peep ’ out of the three - month - old future king as he was baptised by the archbishop of @entity53 , the @entity55 @entity54 , at the @entity56 in @entity57			0
‘ he went in smiling , came out smiling and , as far as we are aware , smiled throughout , ’ said one			0
his good behaviour seemingly resonates that of his mother			0
@entity62 , a 68 - year - old former neighbour of the @entity63 told the @entity64 : ' @entity65 was a good baby			0
she was always very well turned - out and there were n’t any problems			0
' she was very content			0
@entity68 and i would often take the girls for walks together and have a coffee , and there was never much crying			0
’ uncanny : @entity2 has inherited his mother 's button nose and chubby cheeks and it is hard to tell the difference between his and his mother 's 1982 ( r ) christening snap so where did it all begin for @entity8 ? @entity8 was born at the @entity86 , @entity87 , on january 9 , 1982 , the eldest of three children to @entity90 stewardess @entity68 and her trainee pilot husband @entity91 , who had been married for two years			1
the christening of @entity65 took place on june 20 , 1982 — the day before her future husband was born — at her local church , @entity97 ’s , in @entity98 on the banks of the @entity100 , @entity101			2
her father @entity102 sported a traditional dark suit with striped tie for the occasion and posed proudly with @entity8 and @entity68 , who wore a @entity107 floral dress for the down - to - earth family event			1
@entity1 's baptism was very different to @entity8 's small village gathering			1
he was baptised in the @entity111 of @entity112 on august 4 ( the 82nd birthday of the @entity114 ) by the then archbishop of @entity53 , @entity115			0
little lookalike : @entity8 pictured on june 20 1982 at her local church , @entity97 's , with grandmother @entity117 ( mother of @entity119 ) and @entity1 ( r ) at his baptism on august 8 , 1982 princess @entity126 , just 21 and wearing a fuchsia pink , blue and white floral dress with a pink hat set at a rakish angle , looked radiant			1
but she later confided to friends that it had been a trial			0
‘ no one consulted me as to whether 11am would fit in with @entity1 ’s schedule , ’ she said			2
‘ i was totally excluded , totally exhausted and the photos went on and on			0
i blubbed my eyes out			0
’ @entity2 's intimate christening , which saw just 23 guests in attendance , was a far cry from @entity1 's , but the little boy has definitely inherited some of his father 's key features			1
@entity2 has inherited his father 's eyes and ears , and his late grandmother @entity126 's face shape			1
' @entity2 is a very bonny baby , just like his father , ' said @entity148 , a historian of the monarchy at @entity150			2
like father , like son : @entity2 has inherited his father 's eyes and ears , and his late grandmother @entity126 's face shape ( r ) shows @entity1 in 1982 at his own christening with @entity126 ' the resemblance to his father during the christening was particularly striking because he wore an identical christening robe			1
' the robe is a replica of one first used by @entity31 @entity30 ’s eldest daughter and then subsequent royal christenings , including the @entity16 ’s			0
' the original is now too fragile so the replica was commissioned by the @entity31 and used for the christening of @entity170 ’s son @entity169 , @entity169 , and @entity2			2
' in an historic ceremony which brought together four generations of the @entity174 , the three - month - old future king was christened by the @entity175 in the @entity56 at @entity57			0
runs in the family : the tot even has a similar profile to @entity30 ( pictured left , in the late 1800s ) big day : @entity2 wore an ivory gown made of delicate @entity181 lace and white satin , worn before him by every baby born to the @entity184 since 1841 when he was welcomed into the faith , @entity2 wore an ivory gown made of delicate @entity181 lace and white satin , worn before him by every baby born to the @entity184 since 1841			1
royal babies were traditionally , until 2004 , christened wearing the intricate lace and satin gown made for @entity31 @entity30 's eldest daughter , @entity30 , princess royal in 1841 and used for generation after generation of royal infants including the @entity31 ’s father @entity194 , the @entity31 , @entity195 , @entity1 , prince @entity196 , with lady @entity197 the last royal baby to wear it in 2004			1
crafted from layers of delicate , hand - made @entity181 lace and ivory satin , it was used for all royal christenings until 2004 when @entity31 decided the gown was past its prime and ordered an exact replica to be crafted by her personal dressmaker .			1

@entity2 has inherited the @entity8 button nose and chubby cheeks
also has @entity1 's eyes and ears
@entity2 's christening was an intimate family affair , much like @entity8 's
wore ivory gown made of delicate @entity181 lace and white satin , worn before him by every baby born to the @entity184 since 1841
