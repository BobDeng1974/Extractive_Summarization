by @entity0 published : 14:55 est , 18 february 2014 @entity2 : 14:58 est , 18 february 2014 @entity3 , the firm behind hit mobile phone game @entity5 , is planning a @entity7 stock market debut which some analysts think could value it at more than $ 5 billion - and lead to a flurry of technology company listings this year			1
the game , which involves moving candies to make a line of three in the same color , was the most downloaded free app of 2013 , and the year 's top revenue - grossing app. @entity3 , the @entity18 firm behind hit mobile phone game @entity5 , is planning a @entity7 stock market debut the firm has more than 180 titles in 14 languages			1
the most popular include @entity5 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			0
the biggest hit by far is @entity5 , has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch in 2012			1

it has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch in 2012			1
the basic games are free , but players need to pay for add - ons or extra lives			0
the successful flotation of @entity40 in november and a surge in @entity43 shares have fueled speculation that a string of technology firms could come to market , including @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , as well as @entity3			2
but some analysts question whether @entity3 can keep up its breakneck pace of growth , particularly given the difficulty some other games makers have experienced in maintaining success			2
@entity58 , the maker of @entity59 , has seen its share price halve since its late 2011 initial public offering ( @entity62 ) , while @entity64 's @entity63 has struggled to replicate the success of its 2010 hit @entity66			0
' it 's ( @entity5 ) a hot game and @entity3 is a fast - growing company , but obviously you have precedents for these type of companies that have been affected by the boom and bust cycles of the game market , ' said @entity75 , founder of @entity76 , a @entity79 - based @entity62 research and investment house			1
the ipo prospectus offered a first glimpse into @entity3 's money - making machine , which generated $ 1.9 billion in revenues in 2013 , or $ 5 million a day			1
it posted adjusted earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization ( ebitda ) of $ 825 million in the year , up from $ 28.5 million in 2012			2
by comparison , @entity58 and @entity91 , the company behind @entity93 , both earned around $ 900 million in revenues last year			0
the game 's success has been described as ' staggering ' " @entity5 , " the maddeningly addictive mobile game that involves matching bright - hued virtual candies in a row to have them disappear , only to be replaced by more			0
@entity102 , an analyst at @entity103 in @entity104 , said the results in @entity3 's @entity7 filing were ' staggering ' , but noted a slowdown in quarterly revenues at the end of 2013			1
' have we seen peak revenue and bookings for @entity3 , or can they make up for declines with other games ? ' he questioned			2
@entity3 co-founder and ceo @entity116 said the group , which is 48.2 percent - owned by private equity firm @entity119 , had so far launched five games for mobile phones and all had attracted substantial fan - bases			0
' mobile usage is exploding and games are commanding the lion 's share of time spent , " he said in the prospectus			0
' consumption habits have changed - mobile has meant that people consume more digital content than they ever have before , and they want to be entertained over short periods of time whenever and wherever they are			0
' @entity136 tech and telecoms group @entity134 bought 51 percent of @entity91 late last year , valuing the firm at $ 3 billion , or around 6.5 times its 2013 ebitda			0
applying the same multiple to @entity3 's 2013 ebitda would value the firm at around $ 5.3 billion			1
' the risk here is that the company is valued beyond the $ 7 - $ 10 billion range because it is a hot company , ' @entity76 said			0
' on the first or the second day of trading the company is going to be an expensive buy and if the stock does well in the first month or so there is no room for upside			0
' @entity3 , which plans to list on the @entity154 under the symbol " king " , intends to raise up to $ 500 million in the listing , but the amount a company says it plans to raise in its first ipo filings is used to calculate registration fees and the final size of the ipo could be different			1
founded in @entity18 in 2003 , @entity3 was profitable in 2005 and has not had a funding round since september of that year , when it raised 34 million euros ( $ 46 million ) from @entity119 and @entity166			1
in the last few months , it has made more than $ 500 million in dividend payments - including a $ 217 million payout this month - to its board of directors , its top executives and major investors			1
