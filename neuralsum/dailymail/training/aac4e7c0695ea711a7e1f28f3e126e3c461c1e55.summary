by @entity0 more than 24,000 children are skipping school every day to go on family holidays as parents ignore the threat of fines to escape peak - time price hikes			1
official figures reveal a sharp drop in the number of schools giving permission for term - time holidays following a crackdown by education secretary @entity15			1
but growing numbers of parents are taking children on ‘ unauthorised ’ family breaks , despite the threat of £ 120 fines and even court action			1
the @entity23 family : ( left to right ) @entity24 ( 13 ) , mother @entity25 , @entity26 ( 6 ) , father @entity27 and daughter @entity28 ( 15 ) on holiday in @entity30 last september so - called ‘ middle - class truancy ’ is linked to inflated prices imposed by travel companies during half - term , @entity34 , @entity35 and summer school holidays			1
prices can be double normal rates and savings on the holidays often outweigh the cost of any fines			2
mr @entity15 tightened the rules from last september to prevent unnecessary disruption to children ’s education			1
heads were previously able to grant up to ten days holiday a year			1
but changes to the regulations remove references to the ten - day threshold and make clear heads ‘ may not grant any leave of absence during term - time unless there are exceptional circumstances ’ , such as a family bereavement			1
provisional figures show that more than 24,000 pupils skipped classes every day in the autumn term last year despite the crackdown			2
about three - quarters of these had been taken out of school without the permission of the @entity66 who fail to gain the consent of the head teacher risk truancy fines of £ 120 – or £ 60 if paid within 28 days			1
the true figures for pupils missing lessons could be higher since the @entity73 realised late yesterday some schools had not been counted			0
a @entity73 spokesman said : ‘ we do not expect the error to have a significant impact on the rates of absence			0
’ provisional figures show that more than 24,000 pupils skipped classes every day in the autumn term @entity73 figures showed the percentage of school sessions missed due to family holidays dropped from 0.5 per cent in autumn 2012 to 0.4 per cent			0
it followed a decline in the number of schools authorising holidays			0
at primary level , approved family holidays were cut by around half			0
they accounted for 4.6 per cent of absence in autumn 2013 – down from 9.1 per cent the previous year			0
but unauthorised holidays made up 7.4 per cent of overall – up from 4.6 per cent for the same term last year			0
the overall truancy rate at primary level crept up from 0.7 per cent of sessions missed to 0.8 per cent			0
similar , but less marked , trends were seen at secondary level , where parents tend to take fewer term - time holidays			0
in total , the equivalent of 258,700 pupils missed school every day between september and december last year through illness , holidays or truancy – some 4.3 per cent of lesson time			2
this marked a decline from 5.2 per cent – 323,600 pupils – over the same period in 2012			0
it meant school attendance levels have reached an eight - year high			2
at the same time , the number of children classed as ‘ persistent absentees ’ – those missing 15 per cent of lesson time or 18 months over a school career – also dropped , from 6.4 to 4.6 per cent			2
it meant 278,305 pupils were deemed persistent absentees , down from 396,450 in @entity128 are issuing record numbers of truancy fines , up more than a quarter last year to 52,370 but four in ten parents – more than 21,600 – failed to pay			1
now mr @entity15 is drawing up plans to claw back truancy fines directly from child benefit to ‘ send a clear signal that children have to turn up to school and there ’s a price to pay if they do n’t ’			1
education minister @entity140 said : ‘ there is still more to do and we are determined to further help schools reduce absence and improve behaviour			0
