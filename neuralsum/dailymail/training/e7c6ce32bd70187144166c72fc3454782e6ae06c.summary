by @entity0 published : 04:39 est , 30 march 2013 updated : 11:08 est , 30 march 2013 it is the driest desert in the world , with some weather stations there having never recorded any rainfall			0
but the @entity7 in northern @entity8 may come to life as researchers use water collected from fog to grow plants in the previously desolate area			1
photographer @entity15 captured images of locals at the village of @entity19 who use huge specially designed nets to gather water from vaporised droplets in the air			1
scientists at the @entity46 research centre , run by the @entity47 have shown that water spilt during the collection of fog water has led to a variety of plantlife growing in the desert			1
the garden grew from seeds hidden in the desert for many years			0
later experiments showed that by using fog water the desert could be transformed and turned into large scale farms and gardens			2
the @entity7 , spanning from @entity8 to @entity63 , is considered the driest place on @entity65			0
it is so arid that even mountains reaching as high as 22,589 ft are completely free of glaciers although there is no water on the ground , moisture in the air from a heavy coastal fog passes through the net and condenses before travelling through pipes into tanks where it is stored			1
@entity79 and @entity80 from a water collecting co-operative in @entity19 , northern @entity8 sit by a large fog collecting net			0
local people , such as @entity80 ( pictured ) , are able to use the fog water for agriculture and drinking @entity88 of the @entity89 waters a small garden at the @entity46 fog oasis near @entity92 in @entity8 farmers at a fog collection co-operative in @entity19 , northern @entity8 inspect aloe vera plants which they grow using the water from large fog collecting nets the fog collectors are huge nets hung between two poles and are made of a polypropylene mesh that captures the droplets			1
when the droplets gather together they then run into the storage tanks			0
the water is pure for drinking and can be used for agriculture , with a collective in the village of @entity19 use the water for small - scale aloe vera farming			2
however , if the process was used on a larger scale the possibility to change the hostile desert environment is great			0
the water is pure enough to drink and can also be used for agriculture , helping to boost the local economy the fog water condenses on the nets and is collected in large containers			1
with more investment the water could help revitalise the area @entity88 of the @entity47 , @entity127 checks the water level of a tank that stores water collected from fog catching nets at the @entity46 fog oasis the plants grown from water spilled during the process shows that there are a wide variety of seeds in the ground			1
fog water has been used to transform once arid patches of desert into gardens			1
currently water is piped to towns from hundreds of miles away in the @entity147 or driven by water trucks , so fog collection could prove to be a sustainable way to revitalise the area			0
non-profit organisation @entity152 , who make collection nets , say that each cubic meter of fog contains 0.05 to 0.5 grams of water			2
fogquest projects have been established in @entity63 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , and @entity168			0
@entity15 is an award - winning corporate and editorial photographer based in @entity170			2
he has photographed everyone from @entity172 , to @entity173 .			0

photographer @entity15 captured images in the desolate @entity7
locals collect water from the coastal fog for drinking and agriculture
the process has shown that it is possible to grow plantlife on the arid land
fog water is collected as tiny droplets of moisture condense on *giant* nets
