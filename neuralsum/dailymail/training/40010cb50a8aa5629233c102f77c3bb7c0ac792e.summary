a coroner said she would have needed the speed of @entity6 to get across the road safely a woman of 87 who died after being hit by a van on a busy dual carriageway would have needed the speed of @entity6 to get across the road safely , a coroner said yesterday			1
pedestrians had just four seconds to cross four lanes , with no central refuge , before traffic lights turned from red to green			2
an inquest heard that widow @entity1 would have taken an estimated 4.4 seconds just to get halfway across the @entity20 close to her home in @entity22 , @entity23			1
as a consequence , the @entity25 hearing was told , the pensioner had little chance of making it across safely and was knocked down by a van turning right from a side street			1
she suffered multiple injuries and died two weeks later in hospital			1
recording an accident verdict , coroner @entity34 said it was ‘ ludicrous ’ that pedestrians had such a short time to cross the road			2
although there was no pedestrian crossing attached to the lights , lowered kerbs indicated that it was an area used by them to navigate the road , he said			2
mr @entity34 added that he would be writing to the local authority to demand new safety measures , saying even @entity49 sprinter @entity6 , the fastest man on the planet , would have found it hard to get across the carriageway in time			0
‘ if a pedestrian is trying to cross safely they have four seconds , which if you are @entity6 is difficult , and there is no refuge in the centre , no lane markings , ’ said mr @entity34			2
‘ it strikes me how ludicrous this is			0
the fact there is a lowered kerb indicates to pedestrians they can cross the road there			0
‘ it seems entirely unacceptable to expect an 87 - year - old to get across			0
i will write to the chief executive of @entity74 council to see if a pedestrian phase could be added to the lights			0
' i know it is scant help to the family but it might help other pedestrians			0
’ death : the junction of @entity85 and @entity86 in @entity22 , @entity23 , where @entity1 was knocked down by a van whilst crossing the @entity20 wrong : pedestrians had just four seconds to cross four lanes , with no central refuge , before traffic lights turned from red to green			1
an inquest heard that @entity1 would have taken an estimated 4.4 seconds just to get halfway across the road driver @entity96 told the inquest that he had not seen mrs @entity1 when he turned on to the @entity20 from @entity85 in january last year			1
he said : ‘ i set off when the lights turned green to turn right			0
i was in first gear			0
i saw an object in front of me and i slammed the brakes on			0
’ mrs @entity1 , who lived alone , was taken to hospital but died a fortnight later from broncho - pneumonia due to her injuries			1
fast : the coroner said mrs @entity1 would need the speed of @entity49 sprinter @entity6 , pictured , to get across the road safely police crash investigator pc @entity111 said that when the traffic lights went to red , mrs @entity1 would have had just over four seconds to cross the road before traffic moved again			1
but he added : ‘ it depends how mobile the individual is			0
we estimated it would take her 4.4 seconds just to walk to the centre of the road			1
