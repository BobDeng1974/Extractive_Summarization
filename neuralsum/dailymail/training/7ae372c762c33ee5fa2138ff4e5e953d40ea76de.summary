the biggest boat : measuring in at almost a quarter - mile long , it can carry more cargo than a 41 - mile - long train gloomy : the vast amount of cargo seen here shows the huge capacity the shipping container has the main engine of a ps - class vessel such as the @entity1 produces 109,000 horsepower , equal to that of 1,156 family cars the yawning proportions of the ship make it difficult to comprehend - but one photographer took the opportunity to try and capture the dimensions of the vessel her maiden voyage took her from @entity36 , stopping by @entity37 , @entity38 , the @entity39 , before landing in @entity40 in just three weeks during 2006			1
she made headlines that year when she was nicknamed @entity42 because she carried tonnes of @entity45 goods from @entity46 to the @entity47			0
professional @entity50 photographer @entity49 took pictures of the massive ship and compiled them into a photo series of his own dubbed container , @entity48 reported			0
he captured the life of the container - from the loading of the ship 's cargo in @entity60 , to it 's 100 - mile journey across the @entity61 to @entity62 , and the daily routine and sights			0
making waves : combined , the accommodation and bridge of a ps - class vessel are as high as a twelve - storey building named after @entity1 , @entity12 's late wife , it can carry up to 170,794 gross tonnes , and can reach speeds of 25.5 knots the ship measures 397 m ( 1,302 ft ) long , its beam measures 56 m ( 184 ft ) , its draught is 16.02 m ( 52.6 ft ) and it reaches a depth of 30 m ( 98 ft ) @entity49 captured the life of the container - from the loading of the ship 's cargo in @entity60 , to it 's 100 - mile journey across the @entity61 to @entity62 @entity49 successfully completed his three - year apprenticeship as a photographer in 2008			1

her maiden voyage took her from @entity36 , stopping by @entity37 , @entity38 , the @entity39 , before landing in @entity40 in just three weeks during 2006 in theory , a ps - vessel like the @entity1 could transport approximately 528 million bananas in a single voyage - enough to give every person in @entity109 or @entity110 a banana for breakfast the photographer 's work has taken him to many different countries around the world - including the middle east , @entity90 and @entity46 she is one of eight e-class containers owned by the @entity9			1
when she was launched in 2006 , she was the largest container ship ever built a single 20 - foot container can hold about 48,000 bananas			0
so , in theory , a ps - vessel like the @entity1 could transport approximately 528 million bananas in a single voyage - enough to give every person in @entity109 or @entity110 a banana for breakfast			1
the main engine of a ps - class vessel such as the @entity1 produces 109,000 horsepower , equal to that of 1,156 family cars , the company 's official website claimed			1

in february , @entity91 ordered the largest ships in its fleet to stop using their stern thrusters until investigators discover what caused a flood that left @entity1 ’s engineroom under 18 m of water in an incident near the @entity39			2
making @entity1 seaworthy again is a complicated process , and the company said it is probably a matter of months before she can enter service again			2
