@entity0 is n’t the selfie type			1
so when the @entity4 manager slipped his camera phone out at @entity6 on saturday , you could n’t help but notice			1
‘ my family was in the stands , my two sons ( @entity12 , 13 , and @entity13 , 20 ) and my older brother ( @entity14 )			1
they were sitting just behind the goal in the top tier			0
‘ my brother is over from @entity18 , he came over for the @entity20 final			2
they have the chance to go to the executive box or be in a better area but they prefer to sing the songs with the fans			2
so i took the photo as a souvenir			0
it was a fantastic moment for me and them			0
it was the first time i ’ve done it in my career			0
’ @entity0 took a photo the @entity4 fans at @entity6 as his family were among them @entity38 heads past @entity39 to give @entity4 the lead over @entity41 at @entity6 @entity4 striker @entity38 celebrates as his goals keep @entity4 in the hunt for a top four finish @entity14 still works on the farm where 43 - year - old @entity0 grew up in @entity18 ’s @entity47 province			1
their career paths have taken different directions but that does n’t stop @entity14 providing his younger , more high - profile brother with an honest assessment			1
‘ he is very honest — sometimes too much ! he ’s six years older than me			2
he works on the farm and watches every game live , all the games are on in @entity18			0
’ whether @entity14 , @entity12 and @entity13 joined in with the @entity38 ‘ he ’s one of our own ’ chant is not known			0
they certainly had the chances to do so as two more goals took @entity38 ’s tally to 26 for the season			0
he is certain to be in the @entity66 squad when @entity67 , who was at @entity6 , picks his players for the clashes against @entity70 and @entity71 later this month			1
but another ‘ one of their own ’ , @entity72 , would also have impressed @entity67			2
‘ is @entity72 close to a call - up ? the question is not for me , but @entity67 , ’ said @entity0 , whose side face @entity77 next week			1
@entity72 ( left ) has been linked with an @entity66 call - up after his impressive form for @entity4 @entity80 refused to get carried away with a points target after @entity41 lost to @entity4 ‘ this is @entity72 ’s first full season , even though he is 23 , but he has potential to improve and , like @entity38 , he is progressing in a very good way			1
’ for @entity41 , however , defeat left @entity80 ’s side in the drop zone and preparing for a relegation battle			2
‘ i do n’t think it ’s worth setting points targets			0
you can only control what you can control and the points target now is three points in the next game , ’ said @entity80 .			0
