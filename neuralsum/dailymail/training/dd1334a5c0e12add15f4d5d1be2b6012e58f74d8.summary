she needed help , ' he told @entity34			2
' going across the rapids like that , it 's slippery			0
i got knocked over a few times			0
' all it did was scrape my shin , but i could feel the bruise			0
i knew i 'd hit it pretty hard , ' he added			0
mr @entity7 woke up the next morning feeling stiff , and when he began suffering flu - like symptoms he recognized the signs of infection			1
he elevated his leg and eventually went to his doctor , who put him on antibiotics , but the infection continued to worsen			1
then , less than a week after the kayak incident , mr @entity7 felt a swelling behind his knee and went to the @entity55 at doctors @entity56 and saw dr @entity57 , the center 's medical director			1
mr @entity7 told @entity59 : ' when dr. @entity57 saw it , i think he knew what it was straight away			1
' ' he said , ' i 'll stop cutting when i run out of infection			2

' the fascia does n't have a good blood supply to kill the bacteria			0
' it 's very uncommon			0
