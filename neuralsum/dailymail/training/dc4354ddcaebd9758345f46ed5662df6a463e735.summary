a top chef has claimed women find it harder to survive in @entity4 ’s ‘ warzone ’ kitchens because they are testosterone - fuelled and violent			1
@entity6 , who owns @entity4 ’s only pub with two @entity9 stars , questioned whether it was ‘ the industry for them ’ because of the ‘ threatening ’ atmosphere in many kitchens			1
he added that chefs traditionally needed ‘ fire in their belly ’ to get the work done , but this may be the reason why fewer women were in the job			2
@entity6 , who owns @entity4 ’s only pub with two @entity9 stars , questioned whether it was ‘ the industry for them ’ because of the ‘ threatening ’ atmosphere in many kitchens however , the television star also said he wanted more women to enter the profession , because it would stop their male colleagues talking about ‘ boobs ’			1
@entity6 , 41 , who has appeared on the @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , was speaking during an appearance at the @entity36			1
he also promoted chuckles from the audience when he spoke about his worst bugbear – people needlessly investing in lots of kitchen equipment			1
he said people needed to stop being preoccupied with ‘ fashionable ’ gadgets like centrifuges and just rely on the simple oven and hob			1
but his controversial comments on women raised some eyebrows in the audience and are likely to provoke the wrath of gender equality campaigners			0
@entity6 , 41 , spoke about his worst bugbear – people needlessly investing in lots of kitchen equipment he said of the traditional kitchen : ‘ it ’s a machine and it ’s a monster and it ’s full - on			1
this does n’t just apply to girls , we have loads of blokes do a runner			2
‘ the pressure and intensity of cooking for that amount of people is so intense , it ’s so full - on			1
it ’s like a warzone almost			0
‘ i like girls in kitchens a lot because it does bring that testosterone level down a little bit , it does make it not so aggressive			1
‘ but then at the same point a lot of that fire in the chef ’s belly you need , because you need them to force themselves to be ready for dinner service			2
‘ that ’s probably why there ’s not so many female chefs			2
‘ they are out there			0
it ’s just whether it ’s the industry for them i ’m not sure , at that level			0
’ however , he did praise one female chef , @entity97 , who he said did a ‘ phenomenal job ’ running the kitchen at @entity100 in @entity101			1
and when challenged on his view , he added that he would prefer to have more women enter the profession to change its culture			0
he said that while chefs needed ‘ that dynamic of getting things done , that ability to dig deep and be put under pressure , ’ some took it too far			2
he added : ‘ to go to the extreme where some kitchens go to , where it ’s very uncomfortable and where it is perhaps violent , where it is perhaps feeling threatening , that is taken away a lot by having girls in the kitchen			1
‘ we try to make it an environment where people feel happy at work , that ’s the most important thing			1
‘ and girls in the kitchen make blokes feel happy at work			1
it ’s a nicer environment			0
’ he added : ‘ it ’s a different level of conversation			1
if there ’s 16 blokes in a kitchen all talking about boobs and football – we need girls in kitchens so that we just talk about football			1
’ @entity6 said that his own kitchen , at gastropub @entity142 in @entity143 , @entity144 , the atmosphere was for the most part friendly			1
' we try to make it an environment where people feel happy at work , that ’s the most important thing			0
and girls in the kitchen make blokes feel happy at work			2
it ’s a nicer environment ’ he had been running the business with his wife @entity158 , a sculptor , since 2005 – and the waiting list to book a table is often a year long			2
but for those who can not wait to sample some of his cooking , his most important tip for making his dishes at home was to ditch all unnecessary equipment			0
he said it was his bugbear that people invested in expensive gadgets when a basic oven was enough			0
‘ there ’s new methodology and there ’s new ideas and there ’s new technique but there ’s no new sea bass , ’ he said			2
‘ so many chefs get confused with fashion and idea and are all about technique and showcasing and foraged ingredients and things being put through centrifuges			0
‘ just cook it in a pan and serve it with a bit of butter			0
get an amazing ingredient and treat it beautifully			0
’ he added : ‘ i have been married to my wife for 14 years and we have never had a microwave in our house			0
‘ what do you need a microwave for when you ’ve got an oven ? that ’s all you need			0
you need an oven and a blow torch			0
‘ and give yourself time			0
