@entity1 great @entity0 has announced his retirement and named the @entity3 as his favourite memory in a 20 - year career			1
@entity0 , 38 , will send down his final ball in the @entity7 this month , either in @entity9 ' final group game on thursday or later if they reach the knockouts			1

he also picked up 310 wickets in 76 tests			0
' i 'm excited and emotional , certainly happy that i 've made the right decision			0
' i knew before this season it was going to be my last season and i think i 've had more fun in the last six weeks than i have in the rest of my career			2
' i did n't bother doing the maths but 20 years is a lot of ice baths , a lot of training sessions , a lot balls bowled and a lot of flights			0
' but it 's given me so many great memories			2
' @entity0 of the @entity9 runs out @entity45 of the @entity46 during the @entity7 match last weekend @entity0 ( right ) sits with the late @entity48 during an @entity49 as they watch on during the game asked for his favourite moment , @entity0 was quick to recall the unforgettable series against @entity54 10 years ago			1
@entity1 may have lost the contest , an unusual event at the time , but it remains the peak of his time in a @entity60			1
' my favourite @entity62 series has got to be the @entity63 ' 05 , ' he said			0
' what that did for cricket and for the people involved was incredible			0
@entity68 ( right ) consoles @entity0 during the @entity3 at @entity69 @entity0 retired from international cricket in 2012 but has since forged a successful career in @entity72 ' bat sales were up 68 per cent after that series i 've been told			1
the spirit in which it was played ... i never played another series that tough			0
' i had @entity68 running in at 95mph and two minutes later after they won we had a cold beer , a chat and a laugh			0
' that 's what sport is about			2
' @entity0 celebrates taking the wicket of @entity90 batsman @entity89 in an odi in july 2012 although the @entity7 and @entity93 offer veteran cricketers the chance to extend their career well past their prime - with @entity0 himself having been tempted out of an earlier retirement by the @entity72 riches - he insists he is now finished for good			1
' yeah , i 've had more comebacks than @entity100 ... but there wo n't be any comebacks after this			0
