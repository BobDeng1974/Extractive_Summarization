by @entity0 published : 19:28 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 02:46 est , 28 february 2013 three independent reviews commissioned by then health minister @entity2 were produced by top consulting firms @entity4 was accused yesterday of suppressing damning reports revealing a ‘ culture of fear ’ in the @entity7 five years ago which critics say could have saved lives			1
months before the scandal at @entity11 was uncovered , three independent reviews commissioned by then health minister @entity2 were produced by top consulting firms			1
however , they were never published after they heavily criticised management culture and relentless pursuit of targets			1
one involving interviews with dozens of individuals across the @entity27 , by the @entity29 - based @entity28 ( @entity30 ) , described in raw terms how ‘ the @entity7 has developed a widespread culture more of fear and compliance than of learning , innovation and enthusiastic participation in improvement ’			1
it said : ‘ the patient does n’t seem to be in the picture			0
we were struck by the virtual absence of mention of patients and families in the overwhelming majority of our conversations			0
’ one @entity7 worker told the authors : ‘ the risk of consequences to managers is much greater for not meeting expectations from above than for not meeting expectations of patients and families			2
’ most damningly , it noted : ‘ because of the fear of what will happen if targets are not hit , it ’s not uncommon for managers and clinicians to hit the target and miss the point			0
’ @entity59 , the @entity60 mp for @entity61 who is calling for @entity7 chief executive sir @entity62 to resign , tackled @entity63 about the ‘ dangerous ’ culture they revealed at @entity67 ’s questions yesterday			1
she called for an investigation into why the reports were not published , saying : ‘ had they not been suppressed , thousands of lives could possibly have been saved			2
’ mr @entity63 said : ‘ i will look carefully at the issue			0
where there is bad practice and where things are going wrong , we need to shine a very bright light on it and make sure not only that we deal with it but that we hold people to account			0
’ miss @entity59 , who has attacked sir @entity62 for presiding over a ‘ catastrophe ’ at @entity11 , now has more than 30 mps backing her early day motion calling for his resignation			1
catastrophe : @entity59 ( left ) is calling for the @entity7 chief executive sir @entity62 ( right ) to resign she said the reports – which were commissioned for the 60th birthday of the @entity7 and produced in january 2008 – had been ‘ covered up ’			1
‘ they commissioned them to be published , expecting it to be a fantastic news story			2
but they found that beneath their gleaming language and some rigging of statistics , patients had suffered in a very bad way			0
‘ so they swept these reports under the carpet and pretended these catastrophic failings , leading to thousands upon thousands of unnecessary deaths , were not happening			0
’ the @entity30 report noted that while @entity7 funding had nearly trebled over the previous decade , in many areas it had failed to raise standards			2
another report by the highly - respected @entity111 , an independent consulting firm , identified ‘ a pervasive culture of fear in the @entity7 and certain elements of the @entity115 ’			1
a third report , by the @entity117 group , said that while mortality statistics prepared for staff to look at were high quality , there seemed to be no awareness of them			0
when the reports were uncovered by @entity127 requests in 2010 , the @entity115 insisted they had never been intended for publication and had fed into a number of recommendations for the @entity27 published by @entity2 a year later – although none was mentioned by name			1
an adviser to @entity4 ’s health spokesman @entity134 said yesterday : ‘ they fed into the @entity137 review which was published and was a key moment of our latter years , and new quality controls were enacted as a result			2
there was no sinister cover - up			0
’ @entity2 , an eminent surgeon , wrote of the need to restore quality to the @entity7			1
he quit the following year in a move seen as a major blow to @entity148 .			0
