the fight to get to this point only makes the prize on offer more precious			2
for @entity7 , retaining his place against @entity6 would matter every bit as much as facing @entity9			1
the @entity11 goalkeeper has been @entity13 ’s pick for each of the four @entity16 qualifiers to date			1
he has not let his manager down , yet is keenly aware that competition for the jersey continues to intensify			1
@entity20 and @entity21 each played 45 minutes of wednesday night ’s 1 - 0 friendly win over @entity23			1
if one were reading the runes , it might suggest that @entity7 will get the run - out when @entity6 visit @entity28 tomorrow			1
@entity29 's @entity7 admits retaining place against @entity6 is as important as facing @entity9 the 30 - year - old will assume nothing , however , until he has heard @entity13 read out the 11 names in the morning			1
if that leads to a 17th cap , there will be no hint of complacency			2
@entity7 went through years of travelling away with the national squad without much hope of playing			1
on the rare occasions he was selected , he had an unfortunate tendency to end up on the wrong end of a hefty scoreline through no error of his own			2
it almost seemed the fates were conspiring against him , but @entity7 transformed the situation through his outstanding form for @entity11 in the @entity51 last season			1
having finally leap to the front of the queue , he is determined to stay there			2
‘ everyone knows my history with @entity29 , ’ @entity7 reflected			1
‘ i had to wait years and years to get caps , so it makes each one more valuable now as i get older			2
‘ i do n’t want to give it up , so i ’ll just continue to do what i can			2
it does n’t matter to me if it is @entity9 or @entity6			2
there is a lot of pressure on us to win the game and it puts us in a great position if we manage to do it			0
@entity13 has picked @entity7 for all four @entity16 qualifiers to date ‘ years ago , i never thought i should be playing			1
then @entity21 came in at a stage when i was n’t playing			1
so there was never a time when i expected to play			0
‘ it ’s just in the last couple of years when i have got myself to a level where i can believe in myself to go and play			0
injuries put @entity21 and @entity20 out and i managed to get a chance and play well , so that ’s why i was probably in the team			1
‘ with the standard of the keepers here , it ’s difficult to consider yourself the no 1			2
i ’ve waited a long time to get a chance , but the boys are all fit			0
@entity20 has done great to get playing at @entity91 and @entity21 is playing in the @entity51			1
‘ i do n’t think it would be a massive decision whoever played , but the gaffer has stuck with me since the beginning of the campaign and i hope to keep playing well and stay in the side			2
’ clearly , there is a professional rivalry within the goalkeeping trio , described by no less a judge than @entity102 as @entity29 ’s best - ever crop			1
but it is distinctly cordial in nature			0
@entity7 has not yet let his manager down , but is aware that competition is rising in the ranks ‘ we ’ve been together for a long time now , ’ said @entity7			1
‘ i ’ve been here for over 10 years and @entity20 has been the same , obviously minus a couple of years through injury			1
‘ we know each other so well and we are used to the standard			0
when we are together , it hopefully lifts us to make each other better			0
‘ when i was younger , @entity102 and @entity117 were great			0
that was a great group of goalkeepers , so to hear what @entity102 – a legend for @entity120 and @entity29 – said is a great honour			1
‘ but we ca n’t read too much into that			0
we just have to keep performing as that is what you are judged on			0
we need to concentrate and do our best for the rest for the rest of the campaign			0
‘ i would definitely consider the other guys friends			0
i shared a room with @entity20 for five or six years at the start with @entity29			1
‘ it might be a bit different at club level when there is that one place			0
but being here is about the country			0
we have not been at a championship for so long , so there is no room for sticking the knife in each other ’s back			0
’ @entity21 kept a clean sheet during 45 minutes of action in a friendly against @entity23 whoever is selected tomorrow , they will face a most curious assignment			1
@entity6 have lost their four @entity155 fixtures by an aggregate score of 21 - 0			1
unless something very odd happens , the @entity29 penalty area should verge on a no - go zone			1
‘ it ’s a difficult game to talk about , ’ admitted @entity7			2
‘ concentration levels have got to be high and football is weird			0
there could be a deflection , a set - piece , anything			2
‘ we need to start the game well as the earlier we can score the better			0
@entity20 kept a clean sheet in 45 minutes of action in a friendly against @entity23 ‘ this is probably the only time with @entity29 that you are expected not to have too much to do			1
‘ but concentration is a massive thing in goalkeeping			0
i had it with @entity91 when i was younger , when you would play a lot of games where there was not a lot to do			0
you just have to deal with it and train as normal			0
‘ would i prefer to be busy ? no , i prefer doing nothing ! but you just do n’t know how it is going to play out			0
you ca n’t go into a game relaxed			0
you treat it like any normal game and hope the boys up front can help you out			0

he has not let his manager down , but is aware that competition is rising
@entity20 and @entity21 each played 45 minutes on wednesday
