by @entity0 the polar bear which mauled a 17 - year - old schoolboy to death was elderly and had been suffering from painful worn - down teeth which made it behave ' aggressively and unpredictably ' , an inquest has heard			1
@entity7 , 17 , was on an adventure holiday to the remote @entity10 islands , north of @entity11 , in august 2011 with the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) when he died			1
the @entity14 pupil from @entity15 , @entity16 , was sleeping in his tent when the bear went on the rampage , inflicting fatal injuries to his head and upper body			1
@entity7 , 17 , was mauled to death by a polar bear on a trip to the @entity26 in august 2011			1
@entity27 , the corpse of the polar bear , which behaved unusually and aggressively because it had severe tooth pain four others were hurt before the bear was shot dead at the camp site , where the group , known as @entity35 , had been staying			1
also injured during the incident were trip leader @entity37 , from @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , from @entity41 , @entity42 , from @entity43 , and @entity44 , from @entity45 in @entity46			1
assistant coroner for @entity16 and @entity49 @entity48 said that a post-mortem examination of the bear ’s mouth found that it suffered from worn - down teeth , a cavity in one , swollen and red gums and peritonitis in several teeth			1
the inquest into @entity7 's death heard how the polar bear , pictured after it was shot dead , attacked the camp the camp site where @entity7 was mauled to death			1
witness @entity64 said : ' the bear reared up and then slammed itself down on to @entity67 ' he said that the report stated that the pain suffered by the bear would have influenced its behaviour			1
mr @entity48 said : ' ( the bear ) had badly aligned teeth causing them to wear down more than normal			1
it ’s probable it affected the bear ’s ability to gain food and if the bear is in pain it would have increased levels of stress causing it to behave more aggressively and unpredictably than it would otherwise			1
' mr @entity48 said that an examination of the teeth showed that the bear was estimated to be 24 years - old			1
he continued : ' the teeth suggest the bear is very old , more than 20 years based on the appearance of the teeth			1
the fatality rate for bears in @entity10 is high after 15 years , and very high after 20 years , it ’s rare for a polar bear to reach 25 years			2
' an independent report produced by high court judge sir @entity93 on behalf of @entity12 also said the bear was seriously underweight at about 250kg rather than the typical 400kg and the maximum age of a polar bear was normally 25			2
expedition leader @entity98 , 31 , left , yesterday told of how he fought the polar bear that killed @entity7 , 17 , right lieutenant general @entity100 , from @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , who is executive director of @entity12 , said the organisation had adopted all of the recommendations made by sir @entity93 in his report			1
he explained that the specific recommendations relating to polar bears were not implemented because @entity12 have not returned to areas where polar bears lived since the incident three years ago			0
in his conclusion , sir @entity93 criticised the reliance on a tripwire system to alert the group to the presence of polar bears and said that a bear watch should be used instead and also called for an overhaul of rifle training			2
sir @entity93 concluded : ' in future a bear watch must become the norm for expeditions to @entity10			2
the @entity127 was described as ' a fine young gentleman with amazing potential ' ' there needs to be complete review of available tripwire systems but they should be treated only as a secondary protection device			0
there needs to be a rigorous upgrade of rifle training			0
' mr @entity100 defended the two leaders of the expedition , mr @entity40 and mr @entity37 , and said : ' these two leaders were perfectly competent , if we were to select them today we still would			2
' he said he was not aware at the time that there were parts of the tripwire system missing			0
he added that he had accepted the equipment , which was modified by the expedition group with paperclips , was unsatisfactory and explained that the @entity12 was working with a company to build a new system which was being trialled in @entity150			2
@entity152 , representing the @entity7 family , criticised the system , saying it was designed to protect chickens from foxes and asked mr @entity100 : ' when safety equipment is modified , it needs to be tried and tested by the manufacturer , not by children of 16 who had their physics gcse ? ' mr @entity100 said the tripwire did not fire because the bear hit a post rather than the wire , and added : ' however much equipment we had around that camp , if the bear had hit a post it would not have gone bang			1
' we have accepted what sir @entity93 said is the way we should go and we have actively sought to develop another system which will be more effective but i can never guarantee any system			0
' in principle , we have accepted in the future it will be safer if there is a wire and a bear watch			2
this is not a fly - by - night organisation , we tasked a high court judge to carry out an independent inquiry ... we are absolutely an open book			0
' saying that the rifle training will be improved , mr @entity100 , who was formerly commandant of the @entity187 at @entity188 , said : ' what we are putting in place is more training which may reflect better the situation they may find themselves in by getting people tired , by getting their heart rate moving faster and providing distraction and getting them to fire the appropriate distance			0
' but it 's going to be down to the individual and how they respond to stress and some are better than others			0
' he said that mr @entity37 , who had difficulty firing a rifle at the bear before finally being able to shoot it dead , had a background in using firearms and he would have chosen him to handle the rifle			0
he added : ' on the occasion he did n't get it right but he did have the absolute courage after he had been badly injured to come back , find a round and shoot the bear			2
' @entity219 , chairman of the @entity220 ( @entity221 ) which the @entity12 is now known as , said : ' it 's important , not just for us nor just the exploring community but also for the family , that we find out what we could about the expedition and the events surrounding @entity7 's death and thus we commissioned the inquiry and i felt it was very important we found somebody to do that who we could rely upon to be dispassionate			1
' we had already , in fact , been undertaking a review of our whole operations beforehand and this formed part of our strategic review and with that we carried out the recommendations that sir @entity93 laid out in his inquiry			0
' as far as i am aware , everything has been implemented			0
' describing the aims of @entity221 , he said : ' it 's about developing the character of young people and it does this primarily by taking them on expeditions to remote locations			0
' these expeditions are intentionally challenging and all of them have a scientific purpose			0
' furthermore , i should add we do a lot of work helping very disadvantaged people in society to improve their lot			0
' he added : ' i would like to add that , both personally and from a society perspective , there is a genuine feeling of sympathy to the family			0
i really wish the family not to forget that we mean it sincerely			0
' the inquest was adjourned until tomorrow when the coroner is due to give his determination .			0
