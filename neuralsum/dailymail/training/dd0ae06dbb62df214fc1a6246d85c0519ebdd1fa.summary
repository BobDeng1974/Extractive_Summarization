by @entity1 reporter men with broader faces are more likely to be identified as dominant , research shows if you ’re a man who struggles to get his own way at home , it may be down to the shape of your face			1
men with narrower skulls are less likely to be regarded as dominant than those with wider ones , a study has found			1
psychologists from @entity19 asked volunteers to look at photographs of students with neutral expressions and rate the dominance of their personality			1
they also photographed the volunteers and asked them to fill out a questionnaire about their own levels of authority			0
the research revealed a strong link between the breadth of a man ’s face compared to its height , and how dominant he was considered by himself and others			0
the same could not be said of women			0
writing in the journal @entity41 , the study ’s lead author @entity38 said that others ’ perception of men with broad faces could lead them to believe they are dominant			1
but she added : ‘ it is also possible that men with a higher width to height ratio act inherently more dominant , perhaps as a result of increased testosterone			2
’ ' one potential mechanism which may explain why @entity52 affects male self - perceptions of dominance is how others behave towards them			0
‘ if certain behavioural qualities which signal dominance , such as achievement drive , aggression and cheating and trustworthiness are visible in people ’s faces through their @entity52 , as our study one suggests , then actions towards these individuals may differ			2
‘ this could in turn lead to altered behaviour from the faces ’ owners in response to how they are treated by others			0
‘ however , it is also possible that men with a higher @entity52 act and feel inherently more dominant , perhaps as a result of increased testosterone ’			0
previous studies have found that men with wider faces are more likely to be seen as aggressive , but also more attractive for short - term relationships			1
