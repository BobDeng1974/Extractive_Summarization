@entity0 and @entity1 are facing an uphill battle in the @entity4 popularity stakes this weekend			2
@entity5 is a real life @entity7 for millions yet not even the grandest of shows or white knuckle rides will match the atmosphere in the creaking , cavernous @entity12 on sunday afternoon			1
a sell - out crowd of 62,000 will make their way downtown to witness @entity16 , led out by @entity18 legend @entity17 , in their inaugural @entity20 match against another fellow newcomer in the shape of @entity23			1
@entity24 is expected to make his @entity20 debut against @entity26 on sunday for @entity27 @entity18 star @entity17 will also play in the match on sunday , for the new @entity20 franchise @entity16 the match will take place at @entity32 's @entity12 , which was a venue at the 1994 @entity35 @entity34 it ’s an opening day fixture to get the marketing men salivating			1
yet while the newfangled @entity27 franchise have literally started from scratch , this match , shown live on @entity39 in the @entity40 , marks the culmination of four years of hard work and realised dreams			1
@entity46 , the former @entity47 under 21 and @entity49 midfielder , has been in charge all of that time , thanks in no small part to a chance meeting in a @entity56 - under - @entity55 pub with a bloke called @entity58			2
@entity58 , a director at @entity59 who founded a highly successful it sales and marketing consulting company in @entity62 , has lived in the @entity63 for 17 years and was desperate to make his mark in a football scene he could see growing before his very eyes			2
former @entity49 midfielder @entity46 has guided @entity16 to @entity20 after four years of hard work @entity46 's appointment came after a chance meeting with @entity58 ( right ) , who was desperate to make his mark in a football scene he could see growing before his very eyes out of work after not having a caretaker stint at @entity72 turn into a permanent role , the 54 year - old had already witnessed what effect the beautiful game was having in the @entity63 during a pre-season tour which took him to the fanatical footballing hotbed of @entity80			1
initially the pair , introduced to each other by agent @entity86 , went to @entity62 where @entity58 founded the @entity87			2
at this point , leaving the @entity88 , the third tier of the @entity91 soccer scene , and joining @entity20 was more than a pipedream			1
so @entity58 upped sticks and relocated everyone to @entity32			1
@entity16 tweeted this about how @entity97 wo n't be at the game and wrote : ' sorry , @entity100 - we 're sold out ' a first championship was secured in their inaugural season and , impressively , a fan base in a state which has enjoyed its fair share of disappointments following the folding of @entity20 side @entity110 in 2002 ( @entity110 were based in @entity111 , a good 200 miles away ) , the @entity4 natives got straight behind the @entity112			1
another regular season title and a second championship followed			2
that has ensured that @entity46 has achieved a rare feat – taking a team up through the levels in a country where promotion and relegation are dirty words			2
unlike @entity27 , there is a strong feeling of continuity allied with a natural connection to the city			1
eight players remain the squad from their final @entity88 season			0
@entity23 manager @entity131 will lead his team out for their first ever @entity20 match on sunday @entity23 will begin in front of a 62,000 sell - out crowd against @entity16 at @entity12 in @entity32 yet not everything came easily			1
behind the scenes , @entity58 was working tirelessly			0
he desperately wanted to take the club on to the highest level			0
that , however , needs more than sweat and toil on the pitch			0
with top level franchise costs rocketing from $ 7.5 to $ 100 million , big bucks are needed to take a seat at the top table			0
they were snubbed by @entity20 in 2012			1
enter @entity18 millionaire @entity149 in february 2013			0
having made his money in setting up @entity153 language schools back home , his arrival has been key			0
he provides the conduit between @entity91 and the @entity63 , a partnership which satisfies many people on myriad levels			0
naturally , his wealth and business expertise have ensured @entity16 ’s dream has become a striking reality			1
his links into the @entity91 market , where so much talent bubbles under the surface , have been crucial – @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity18 are all represented in @entity46 ’s squad			0
@entity171 striker @entity170 , 19 , is the youngest designated player in the @entity172			0
@entity173 ( top right ) has arrived on loan from @entity176 and will play for @entity4 in their opening game @entity179 , formerly of @entity180 and @entity181 , is also set to make his mls bow on sunday former @entity183 midfielder @entity182 , the loan arrivals of @entity173 from @entity176 and @entity185 international and free agent @entity179 give their @entity153 boss a reminder of home and some experience to boot			0
most importantly though , @entity4 is the no 1 holiday destination for @entity18 ’s middle classes			0
so where better to start an @entity196 - @entity18 franchise ? an impressive 20,000 were at a championship match against @entity198			1
@entity20 could n't deny them again			1
their place as the 21st franchise was confirmed nine months after @entity203 's arrival			0
the prospect of even more tourist dollars flowing into the city has got the club firmly on - side with the local authorities and businesses			2
@entity27 have made their mark off the pitch with stellar signings to impress their fanbase @entity149 ( left ) has been key to the progress of @entity16 since his arrival in february 2013 unlike in @entity220 when it comes to @entity221 , they are right behind his plans , so much so that , after agreeing a public and private partnership plan , a brand spanking new 19,500 stadium could be ready for the start of next season			1
@entity5 are one of the founding sponsors			0
oh , and he is friends with @entity17			1
when @entity203 came calling , the 32 year - old former world footballer of the year did n’t have to think twice			2
the $ 7.2 million salary - making him the best paid player in the @entity172 - certainly helped			2
his fanfare arrival piqued interest like never before			0
@entity17 is the man @entity46 is building his team and vision around			1
injuries over the years may have taken their toll yet he still managed 56 games last term for @entity244 and @entity245			2
the kind of touch and awareness which saw him join @entity250 for an eye watering £ 57 million in 2009 will be there for all to see			0
@entity203 and @entity58 ’ business plan has been ticking all the boxes so it will be fascinating to see how @entity46 adapts to @entity20 and the injection of quality he will encounter week in , week out			1
only two expansion teams have reached the end of season playoffs in their debut campaign , so history is not on @entity4 ’s side			0
the chairman has already stated that his men have to make sure they ’re the third			0
the pressure is on without a ball being kicked			0
yet with such brilliant support in the stands , the city and the boardroom , you get the feeling @entity46 ’s men are onto a winner , whatever happens			0
@entity17 - @entity16 the @entity18 won the @entity276 back in 2007 , so it is understandable that a lot is expected of him with new @entity20 franchise @entity16			1
he may not be the player he was back in 2007 but he still has the ability to dribble past players and pick a pass			0
@entity97 – @entity27 fc one of two high - profile signings made by @entity27 on their introduction to the league			1
@entity97 won more than 100 caps for @entity47 and 11 major trophies with @entity292 in 13 years			2
he is due in @entity27 in the summer once he has finished playing with @entity293			1
@entity294 – @entity295 the @entity297 midfielder will become the second former @entity47 captain to join @entity295 following the successful period of @entity221			0
like @entity97 , @entity294 will not join @entity295 until the summer once the @entity172 has finished			0
he will link up with former @entity301 team - mate @entity300			2
@entity24 - @entity23 @entity302 became @entity27 ’s first marquee signing when he joined after helping @entity306 win @entity304 last season			1
he has spent time on loan at @entity310 in the @entity312 @entity311 and he will be expected to score the bulk of @entity27 ’s goals in their debut season			1
@entity317 - @entity318 overshadowed by brother @entity319 in @entity47 but since moving to @entity20 he has been the star man for the @entity318			1
he won the @entity320 last season with 27 goals in 32 games			0
with the departure of @entity324 and @entity325 he could struggle to score as many this term .			0

@entity27 and @entity16 face each other in their first @entity20 match
a sell - out crowd of 62,000 will witness the match at @entity12
the match marks the culmination four years of hard work for @entity16
@entity24 and @entity17 are both expected to start the match in @entity32
