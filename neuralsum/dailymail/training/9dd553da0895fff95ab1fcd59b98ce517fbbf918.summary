how do you even begin to start reporting what happened at @entity4			1
if you think the @entity5 is dead , an after thought ; you are wrong			0
@entity6 beats the @entity8 defence and slots home past @entity10 to make it 4 - 2 to @entity12 @entity6 ( centre on his knees ) celebrates scoring the winning goal as his @entity12 team - mates enjoy the moment @entity18 calmly slots home to make it 3 - 2 and cap a remarkable comeback for @entity12 @entity12 's players mob @entity23 after he puts the @entity25 side in the lead for the first time @entity12 manager @entity28 ( right ) and his players and staff celebrate their third goal @entity8 's players are left dejected after @entity12 stage a stunning comeback @entity12 's players celebrate in front of their travelling fans after the full - time whistle @entity12 will now enter the hat for the fifth round of the @entity5 @entity8 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity10 5.5 , @entity42 5.5 , @entity43 5 , @entity44 6 , @entity45 5 , @entity46 6 , @entity47 6 ( @entity48 70 , 5 ) , @entity49 , 5 ) , @entity50 6 , @entity51 5.5 ( @entity52 69 , 5 ) , @entity53 ( c ) 5.5 substitutes not used : @entity54 ( gk ) , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 scorers : cahill 22 ; @entity46 38 @entity12 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity59 7 ; @entity60 ( c ) 7.5 , @entity61 7 , @entity62 7 , @entity63 7 ; @entity64 7 , @entity65 7.5 ( @entity66 89 ) , @entity18 7.5 ( @entity67 86 ) , @entity68 7 ( @entity6 79 ) ; @entity69 7 , @entity70 7.5 substitutes not used : @entity71 ( gk ) ; @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 scorers : @entity76 41 ; @entity65 75 ; @entity23 81 ; @entity6 90 +3 booked : @entity61 , @entity60 referee : @entity78 ( @entity79 ) 6 attendance : 41,014 by @entity81 at @entity4 two goals down against one of the most expensively - assembled squads in @entity85 , @entity12 staged one of the biggest @entity5 giant - killings of all time , leaving @entity8 with a 4 - 2 win			1
@entity70 , @entity65 , @entity18 and @entity6 – @entity12 's goalscorers – will be granted permanent membership into @entity5 folklore			1
but every player played their part			0
as for @entity100 , his side 's tilt at an historic quadruple is over			2
his ego , and those of his players , is battered			0
but that 's a story for another day			2
this is @entity12 's fairytale			1
@entity8 , who were understrength , were cruising ; goals from @entity44 and @entity46 but them on course for a routine win			1
but then that old @entity5 magic cast yet another spell ; a spell that will leave @entity8 's players sleepless for the next few days			1
the home side caught a glimpse of what was to follow when @entity10 produced a brilliant instinctive save to deny @entity62 ' bullet header inside the opening 15 minutes			2
the save sparked the @entity118 , at least for time being , into action			0
first @entity121 , playing as a right winger , and @entity50 both went close before @entity44 broke the deadlock with the most nonchalant of finishes			1
in meeting @entity50 's near post corner , the @entity126 star mustered a cheeky flick with the outside of his boot – reminiscent of @entity118 legend @entity132 's famous strike against @entity133 in 2002 - that flew past @entity59 ' near post to put the @entity118 ahead			1
and in the 38th minute the @entity118 notched their second ; @entity46 exchanging passes with @entity51 before cooly slotting past @entity59			1
game over , right ? wrong			0
as @entity8 failed to deal with @entity65 ' corner , the ball fell to @entity68 who found @entity76 on the edge of the box			1
the former @entity143 striker took a touch before firing an unstoppable left - footed rocket past @entity10			2
@entity44 puts @entity8 ahead with a improvised back - heel effort after 21 minutes against @entity12 in the @entity5 @entity44 watches on as his deft effort flies into the top corner , leaving @entity59 with no chance @entity8 's players mob @entity44 ( third left ) as he celebrates scoring the opening goal @entity46 ( second left ) slots home through a crowd of players to score @entity8 's second goal of the game @entity46 hugs @entity51 as he celebrates scoring the second goal for @entity8 this was n't in the script for @entity100 's side			1
the @entity5 writes its own scripts , though			0
@entity49 tried to restore the home side 's two - goal advantage three minutes into the second period , but his half volley , following some excellent wing play from @entity51 , ballooned wide			1
but that did n't nullify the momentum @entity12 had gathered following 's @entity76 's strike late in the first half			1
@entity65 and @entity68 both fired wide whilst in good positions as the @entity171 sensed an equaliser			0
that was enough for @entity100 to send for the cavalry ; @entity52 coming on for @entity51 , while @entity48 replaced @entity47 , who needed treatment to a head injury after a collision with @entity68			0
@entity48 made an instant impact , locating @entity50 with a brilliant flick only for the @entity180 international to fire wide from a good position before watching @entity53 head his well - flighted free - kick straight at @entity59			0
and a minute later – the unthinkable happened			0
@entity186 's long throw was met by @entity62 , whose header found @entity68 who saw his shot parried by @entity10			0
but the rebound rolled into the direction of @entity65			0
it must have seemed like an eternity for @entity65 as he waited for the ball to drop to his feet at the back post			0
but it was worth the wait as he slotted home to send the visitor 's into a frenzy			0
as if the feat of a @entity25 side coming back from two - down against the @entity204 leaders was n't dramatic enough ; the sub-plot to the equaliser is worth considering			0
@entity65 and @entity68 were both on @entity8 's books as youngsters			1
they 'd dreamed of scoring or providing an assist at @entity4 during those fledgling days			2
@entity70 ( right ) scores for @entity12 to make it 2 - 1 and give the visitors some hope @entity10 dives in vain to try and stop @entity70 's effort but comes up short @entity76 wheels away in celebrates as his @entity12 team - mates rush to congratulate him @entity220 ( right ) celebrates making it 2 - 2 as @entity45 and @entity10 look on helplessly @entity65 wheels away to celebrate after scoring against his former club @entity18 can barely contain his emotion after making it 3 - 2 to @entity12 their dreams had come true , though , perhaps , not in the shirts they 'd envisaged wearing			1
@entity100 responded by throwing on @entity230 – the change did n't make a blind bit of difference though , as @entity12 made history			2
latching on to @entity70 's lay - off , @entity18 's career flashed in front of his eyes in the 82nd minute			1
a moment that defines careers			0
and the midfielder did n't choke , quite the opposite in fact , cooly side - footing past @entity10 from the edge of the box			0
@entity251 erupted from the vocal travelling support and the @entity171 bench			0
@entity12 knew what was coming			2
@entity53 headed wide , before @entity43 fired over the bar from close range after @entity46 ' cut - back			1
and yet there was more drama , the fourth official signalling seven minutes of stoppage time – much to @entity28 's annoyance			2
he need n't have worried , though , as substitute @entity6 notched a fourth after @entity70 's pass to secure the most famous of wins			1
@entity100 had seen enough ; approaching @entity28 before attempting to head down the tunnel early			0
the @entity12 boss was n't having any of it , refusing to shake his counterpart 's hand until the final whistle			1
there were eventually hand shakes			0
@entity12 was shaking on saturday night , as well			2
@entity100 ( right ) exchanges some angry words with his opposite number @entity28 during the first half @entity50 tries his luck from distance as @entity8 piled on the pressure early on in the game			2

@entity44 and @entity46 had put @entity8 2 - 0 up after 38 minutes at @entity4
@entity12 's goals came from @entity70 , @entity220 , @entity18 and @entity6
@entity285 left out of @entity8 squad , fueling *speculation* he is set to to leave the club
