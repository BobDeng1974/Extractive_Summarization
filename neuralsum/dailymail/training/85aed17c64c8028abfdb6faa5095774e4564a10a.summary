' sadly the @entity38 's case is that this defendant did steal mail and he did n't just steal things like dvds or books or money in birthday cards - nothing like that - what he stole was financial information			2

bank cards were found in his car , the court heard			2
' what he did was target financial documents , in particular bank statements , debit cards and pin numbers , ' said mr @entity73			2
' it is probably pretty obvious to anybody that a hard rectangular shape in an envelope is some kind of bank card			2
' bank statements also are obvious pieces of post and you will know if you have bank accounts that @entity85 numbers come out in the post as well a few days after cards are sent			1
' @entity6 was ' a cog ' in a wider fraud that hijacked bank cards in the @entity10 postcode of @entity11 , prosecutors said			1
other members of the gang would allegedly impersonate the card holders to empty the accounts of cash			1
