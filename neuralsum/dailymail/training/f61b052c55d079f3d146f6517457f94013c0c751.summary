incredible images showing the cratered surface of the moon are the first ever to be taken with a @entity4 printed telescope			2
the £ 100 ( $ 160 ) @entity5 is able to produce images with a quality equal to telescopes that cost ten times as much , according to its designers			1
and with plans available to download online , anyone can create the telescope themselves – as long as they own a 3d printer which costs at least £ 400 ( $ 650 )			1
incredible images showing the surface of the moon are the first ever to be taken with a @entity4 printed telescope physicist @entity20 , one of @entity22 's creator , said he believed the telescope would be a ' game changer , ' making telescopes available to the general public			2
@entity22 uses a £ 25 ( $ 40 ) @entity28 camera module and is based on @entity30 's reflecting telescope design			1
the design involves placing a concave mirror to form an image of whatever the telescope is focused on directly onto the @entity28 camera sensor			1
the camera is mounted onto components created by @entity38 and , due to its small size , can sit directly in front of the mirror			0
the telescope has a magnification of times 160 , which means that on a cloudless night it will be capable of detailed lunar observation as well as galaxies , star clusters and some planetary observation			1

this is one of the first images to be taken using the @entity4 printed telescope the @entity5 telescope has a magnification of times 160 , which means that on a cloudless night it will be capable of detailed lunar observation as well as galaxies , star clusters and some planetary observation a @entity64 cargo ship rocketed toward the @entity65 on sunday , carrying the first 3d printer for astronauts in orbit			1
@entity69 should reach the space station tuesday			0
it 's the fifth station shipment for the @entity72 - based @entity64			2
the space station - bound 3d printer was developed by made in @entity75 , another @entity72 company			2
it 's sturdier than @entity78 models to withstand the stresses of launch , and meets @entity82 's strict safety standards			0
the space agency envisions astronauts one day cranking out spare parts as needed			0
for now , it 's a technology demonstrator , with a bigger and better model to follow next year			0
the physicists unveiled the ambitious project , called @entity90 , as part of the @entity92 's @entity93			0
' we 've called this project @entity90 because we hope it will be a game changer , just like all @entity97 , ' said @entity20 , former physicist and member of the @entity99			0
' we hope that one day this will be seen on a par with the famous @entity103 " pavement " telescopes , which allowed hobbyists to see into the night skies for the first time			2
' this is all about democratising technology , making it cheap and readily available to the general public			0

the physicists unveiled the project , called @entity90 , as part of the @entity118 of the mind			0

quality of @entity5 images are equal to telescopes costing 10 times as much
*pikon* plans are available to download online and create using a 3d printer
it uses @entity28 camera and is based on @entity30 's reflecting telescope
on a clear night , it is capable of seeing galaxies , planets and star clusters
