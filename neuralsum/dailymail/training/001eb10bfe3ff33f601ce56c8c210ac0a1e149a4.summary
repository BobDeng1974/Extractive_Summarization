a pregnant woman in @entity1 had a particularly difficult labor this week when she was held at gunpoint on her way to the hospital			2
@entity6 and her husband @entity7 were going 30 miles over the speed limit on tuesday morning in @entity9 , @entity1 , as @entity6 was in labor and felt that if the two did not get to the hospital soon she was going to give birth in a car			1
around that time , a police officer turned on his sirens to pull the couple over , but they kept going , ultimately being stopped when dispatched officers threw down tire spikes , blowing out the couple 's tires			2
and now , in just released video from the dashboard camera of one of the officers , @entity23 can be seen struggling to get down on the ground as multiple officers surround her with their guns drawn , this before being led off to the hospital in a squad car where she gave birth soon after			1
' [ the cop ] starts following me and he turns on his lights an my wife says we ca n’t pull over			0
the baby is coming now , ' @entity7 , who was driving , told @entity67 13			2
said @entity6 , ' i did tell him not to stop			0
' hard labor : a few hours later she gave birth to her daughter @entity71 with her husband @entity7 by her side ( above ) she then added , ' i think i was screaming , " oh dear @entity75 , we ca n’t have the baby in the car			1
” ' keep going : even after a police officer turned on their sirens to pull the couple over , @entity6 told her husband to keep going so she would n't give birth in the car baby girl : @entity71 ( above ) weighed in at a very healthy 10 pounds and what a baby it was , as after the couple was driven to the hospital @entity6 gave birth to her fourth child , @entity71 , who weighed a whopping 10 pounds			1
and while the @entity93 seem to be taking this terrifying incident in stride , and mom and baby are both doing well , charges may still be brought against the two			0
did their best : the couple called 911 to tell them about the situation , but it did not help damage : there is now still a chance the couple will be charged for speeding and not stopping , and they will definitely need new tires ( above ) the scene : the two were going 85 mph in a 555 mph zone , being stopped on @entity112 ( above ) manson police chief @entity113 said that while no charges have been filed yet , it ’s up to @entity116 to decide if that remains the case			0
here 's hoping these two get a break .			0
