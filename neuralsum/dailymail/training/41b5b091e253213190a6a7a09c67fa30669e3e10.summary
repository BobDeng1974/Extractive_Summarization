by @entity0 published : 08:11 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:11 est , 7 february 2014 adopting a raw food diet has helped one woman shed nine stone and cured her of a crippling medical condition			1
@entity8 , 43 , from @entity9 , used a raw juice diet to cure her polycystic ovaries , and help her lose 126lbs in weight			1
the former city worker adopted the diet as a way to cleanse out her overworked body after a lifestyle of drinks parties , late nights and high stress left her overweight and run down			1
but she never expected her change in eating to have such a transformative effect on her life			2
@entity8 , pictured before she lost weight , used to eat a rich dairy - filled diet and her lifestyle included lots of nights out with friends and late nights working or socialising @entity8 has lost nine stone since embarking on her raw food diet and has also been relieved of her polycystic ovary symptoms @entity8 thought she ate reasonably healthily as she ate a pescatarian diet a recent trip to the doctors informed her she has dropped from 22 stone 7lbs to 13 stone 7lbs , slim for her 5ft 9in height			1
in fact @entity8 was so inspired she quit her high flying job and set up her own company @entity40 , which advocates the advantages of the no - meat , no - dairy and no foods heated over 38 - 43 ° c diet			1
while her diet today may sound extreme , @entity8 was once a very normal , career - driven young woman , who , while she made attempts to keep healthy , was ultimately worn out			1
‘ i was not always raw – and far from it ! in my late twenties career success became my prime focus and hand in hand with that came the absence of looking after myself			1
‘ i piled on the weight			2
i had never been an exerciser ! i had @entity55 ( @entity55 ) which is a chronic disease			2
i was overworked , undernourished and toxic			1
‘ i had been a vegetarian ( well a pescatarian really ) since the age of 20 so considered myself pretty healthy as i was n’t eating meat but the truth be told i was eating anything that was n’t meat			2
‘ i had a rich dairy - filled diet that included lots of boozy nights out with friends and late nights working or socialising			1
@entity8 says her lifestyle had left her feeling toxic and her weight had gotten out of control ‘ by my early 30s my weight was out of control – i was still focusing so much on my career i did n’t really focus on anything else			1
i had lost sight of me			1
’ like many women , @entity8 had an ongoing nagging sense she should be taking care of herself more			1
‘ towards my mid 30s i realised that i had to take action and began experimenting with going to the gym			2
i had no idea what i was doing			2
‘ i was instinctively focusing on cleansing my body - again , i had no guidance really and was feeling a bit lost - so began to have colonics and rein the booze in a little			1
@entity8 was given her first book on raw eating as a birthday present and says she lost 10lbs in her first week of juicing she says she now looks and feels much younger than she has for years ‘ over the years a few meaty dishes had crept into my diet and so i focused again on my vegetarian roots			1
it was working and slowly i began to lose a few pounds			2
’ each day i try to consume : however it was another few years before @entity8 began to discover the concept of ‘ eating raw ’ which essentially involves eating a diet of fresh fruits and vegetables which are never cooked above about 40 degrees c in order to preserve their enzymes			1
@entity8 says : ‘ it was on my 38th birthday that things took a turn			1
a friend of mine gave me a book as a gift			1
it was @entity113 7lbs in 7days and i was immediately insulted ! ‘ are you trying to say that i am fat			2
. ! ? ’ i thought			0
' once i had gotten over it i worked my way through that book and dabbled in a few juices			1
eventually i made it to a raw retreat in @entity120 and suddenly i was hooked			2
‘ i lost more than 10lbs in a week ! it was an unbelievable wake up call for me that even though i had @entity55 i could lose weight , even though i had previously been told there is ‘ no cure ’ and that it would be incredibly difficult to lose weight without medication			1
’ ‘ as the weight falls off the more capacity the body has to heal			0
it ’s a wonderful cycle			0
’ @entity8 now eats what she describes as a high plant - based high raw diet			1
‘ i carry my juicer everywhere			0
i lug it across @entity135 in a cool bag if i ’m on the move			0
wherever i go my juicer goes			0
’ ‘ i have so much to be thankful for			0
i have cured myself from polycystic ovaries and a wonderful side effect has also been that i have lost lots of my weight			1
which is blissful ! ‘ my skin is glowing and i look and feel much younger than i have for years			0
looking back at old photos i hardly recognise myself			0
’ around 7am/on rising – ginger tea : hot water with lemon , raw fresh ginger and sometimes some raw honey i drink as much ginger tea as i fancy throughout the day			2
around 8am - breakfast – green juice - 2 golden delicious apples 1 cucumber 1 peeled lemon 1 peeled lime blended with two or three large fistfuls of greens ( spinach or kale etc. )			0
if i am not in the mood for a juice ( which is rare ! ) i might have some chia pudding – which is chia seeds soaked in home made almond milk and served with honey and fruit			0
throughout the morning – green waters – water with a teaspoon of ‘ green powder blend ’ such as wheatgrass , spirulina , chlorella and barleygrass			0
around 11am/mid morning snack – if needed – stuffed dates : organic medjool dates stuffed with wet activated almonds ( soaked in water overnight so they are softer , more easily digestible , enzyme rich and tastier )			0
around 1pm / @entity184 for example : 10oz or large bag of kale , juice 1 lime 1 tsp. himalayan pink salt , 1 tbsp			0
virgin olive oil , 1 tsp. linseeds , 1 tsp. sesame seeds , 1 pinch pine nuts			0
‘ make love to the @entity194 ! – using a large bowl massage the kale with the lime juice , salt and olive oil until the kale is soft and wilted but not too limp			0
remove any final stalks or tough bits as you feel them			0
mix in the linseed , sesame seeds and a big pinch of pine nuts			0
the portion for this dish is one cup per person			0
but i tend to eat as much as i feel i need			0
served with blueberries and perhaps a toasted pitta bread ( not raw ! )			2
around 3pm / afternoon snack – if needed some organic fruit or vegetables , bananas , apples , oranges , carrots , cucumbers ... around 6pm / supper - for example : @entity223 – recipe serves 4 : 1 cup soaked cashews ( soak in filtered or pure water for at least two hours ) 2 cups or more of filtered water , ½ chopped red onion , 6 organic cherry tomatoes , 10 sundried tomatoes ( soaked or if from a jar then washed ) juice of half a lime , ½ cup desiccated coconut , 1 ripe avocado , 1 inch ginger peeled and grated 1½ tsp. cumin , 1 or 2 tsp. cayenne pepper , 1 tsp. paprika , 1 tsp. turmeric , 1 tsp. garam masala 2 clove organic garlic			0
basically blend until a smooth paste is formed and serve ! sometimes i might let it sit in a bowl in the oven with the door open on low if i do n’t fancy eating it at room temperature			0
served with salad or rice			0
( you can serve with cooked rice or make ‘ raw rice ’ by putting half a cauliflower in the food processor – chop finely so it resembles rice and add a handful or pine or other nuts ) .			1
