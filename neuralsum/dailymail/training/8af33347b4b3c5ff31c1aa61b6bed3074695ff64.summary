' glasses - free ' @entity0 has taken another step towards the mainstream , as @entity4 announces a price and release date for the first large set to hit the home			1
on december 10 , @entity4 's @entity9 is also capable of ' @entity12 ' resolutions - four times current hi - def sets			2
sadly , the price should ensure the ' naked eye ' 3d set does n't hit the mainstream straight away - it will be £ 7,400 , and only available in @entity17			2
it will launch in the @entity19 early next year , price to be confirmed			0

' the ' lenslets ' are tiny lenses that ' focus ' the image towards each viewers , using ' face tracking ' to ensure each person sees a correct left eye and right eye image			1
early tech demos have been highly impressive - and @entity4 is well ahead of rival tv companies in ' naked eye ' 3d			2
