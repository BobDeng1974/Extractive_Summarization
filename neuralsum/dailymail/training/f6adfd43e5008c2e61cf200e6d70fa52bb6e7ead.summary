by @entity0 published : 18:29 est , 23 january 2014 updated : 18:30 est , 23 january 2014 the number of married couples with children has reached a record low , census data suggests the number of married couples with children has reached a record low , official figures show			1
there are around four million such families , census data for the whole of the @entity15 shows			1
that is 15.2 per cent of families , or 300,000 fewer than a decade ago			1
it is also 600,000 fewer than @entity20 estimates			1
the news comes at a time of increasing concern over instability within families and the impact on children of family break - up			1
work and pensions secretary @entity29 is conducting a review of family stability which will gather information on how families are changing , which types of family are most at risk of failing , and what the state can do to keep them together			1
pro-marriage groups have told the inquiry the @entity42 ’s efforts to shore up marriage – including a tax break worth up to £ 200 a year to lower income married couples – are too little and may be too late			1
the figures , gathered in the spring 2011 census and published yesterday , also show the number of people who live by themselves is at its highest recorded level			2
there were 4,017,793 households of married couples with children under 16 , or under 18 if they were still in school or college			1
that number has fallen by more than 300,000 since the 2001 census , when there were 4,323,069 married couples with dependent children			1
that is despite rapid population growth in the intervening years , with the number of people living in @entity15 rising by 3.7million , partly as a result of immigration			0
the most recent census found there were 1,053,397 homes of cohabiting couples with children , and 1,895,833 homes with one parent and children , adding up to nearly three million households			2
the @entity76 , which takes a smaller sample of homes to generate annual estimates of how households are made up , said there were around 4,610,000 married couples with children last year – higher by 600,000 than the census			1
@entity20 officials said it was difficult to compare the figures and that census results may be lower because they do not account for families who share homes			1
experts consider married families the most stable - and say cohabiting couples are three times more likely to break up than married people critics fear a lack of advantages for married couples and tax and benefit losses for those who share homes are discouraging married families			1
eight million people live on their own , the most ever recorded , census data shows			0
nearly a third of homes , 31 per cent , have a single occupant			2
some 8.1million people lived alone at the time of the census in 2011			0
analysts said one reason was a trend for couples not to live together			0
more than a million couples live apart , and experts suggested some are motivated by a system of tax and benefits that rewards single claimants while penalising couples and married people			2
in 2001 , 7.4million people lived alone , just over 30 per cent of households			2
researcher @entity124 said : ‘ it is genuinely shocking that the benefits system continues to carry disincentives to people to live together as couples and families			2
’ some analyses have shown that a couple could be £ 100 a week better off by choosing to live in two homes			0
experts consider married families the most stable , with cohabiting couples breaking up three times more quickly than married people			1
@entity138 , of think - tank the @entity140 , said : ‘ there is a couple penalty on all partners who share a home			0
it can cost parents with one child up to £ 7,100 per year in lost tax credits the moment they move into together			0
‘ so the government is incentivising couples not to commit			0
’ he said the government spends huge amounts on problems tied to family breakdown , including juvenile delinquency and truancy			0
he added : ‘ the effects of family instability in early years are felt decades later			0
nearly half of teenagers aged between 13 and 15 are not living with both of their parents			0
’ the census also showed @entity15 is an increasingly integrated society			0
nearly one in eight households contain people who are from different ethnic backgrounds			0
while 88 per cent of homes , or 16.1million , are made up people of the same race and culture , some 2.3million , 12 per cent , are mixed .			0

about 15.2 per cent of families consist of a married couple with children
is 300,000 fewer than a decade ago and 600,000 fewer than @entity20 figures
@entity29 is conducting review of how to keep families together
