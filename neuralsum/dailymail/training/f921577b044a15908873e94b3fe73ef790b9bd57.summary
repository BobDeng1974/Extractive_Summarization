a new species of legless amphibian resembling a giant earthworm or a snake has been discovered in a remote but threatened area of @entity7 rainforest			1

it was confirmed by scientists earlier this month according to leading @entity7 @entity15 herpetologist @entity37			2
' these discoveries are important to demonstrate that much of @entity7 's biodiversity remains unknown and unstudied by science , and many more areas need to be searched , ' @entity37 , who has been researching amphibians and reptiles since 2003 , told @entity44			1
the creature is caecilian -- an order of amphibians that look like snakes or earthworms and are generally found underground			1
once a stronghold of the toppled @entity51 regime , the bio-diverse @entity11 are home to an array of rare species , including the @entity56 elephant , but the area faces widespread deforestation			2
