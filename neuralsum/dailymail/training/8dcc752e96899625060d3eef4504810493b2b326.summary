‘ i am making the announcement now so that the manager and the team are not distracted by stories or speculation about my future			0

in a statement on the club ’s website , @entity6 added : ‘ @entity5 has been such a huge part of all our lives for so long and saying goodbye is going to be difficult , but i feel it ’s something that ’s in the best interests of all involved , including my family and the club			1
