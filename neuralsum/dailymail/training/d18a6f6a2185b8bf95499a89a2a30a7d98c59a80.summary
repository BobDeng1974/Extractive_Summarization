hazard : the bollard has been struck by dozens of drivers and is thought to have caused damage worth ' hundreds of thousands ' in the way : drivers are forced to veer on to the other side of the road as they try to avoid the bollard @entity27 says it frequently has to send crews to reset the bollard and admits it has received damage claims from motorists			1
