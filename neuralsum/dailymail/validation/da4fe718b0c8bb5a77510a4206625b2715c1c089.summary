@entity0 are the most popular @entity1 football club worldwide and also the wealthiest			2
they are comfortably ahead of all their rivals in both these categories , with just four contenders in the pack behind them vying to be authentic ‘ global ’ names with financial clout to match			0
that quartet are @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			2
popularity has been measured by combined followings on @entity17 and @entity18 - the two biggest social media platforms , used by more than a billion people - while wealth has been measured by income in the most recently completed season , namely 2013 - 14			1
@entity0 are closing in on five million followers on social media site @entity18 @entity0 have also attracted a staggering 63 million likes on @entity17 at the other end of the scale , @entity27 have fewer than 30,000 followers on @entity18 the clubs ’ global fanbases and wealth have been considered as part of a @entity36 study to explore which @entity1 clubs are the ‘ biggest ’ ; 58 different teams of the current 92 in the top four divisions have been included in the study , having played in @entity1 ’s top division for at least a season			1
@entity0 were slower than most clubs in embracing social media , not setting up an official @entity17 page until 2010 and only starting an official @entity18 account in 2012			1
but with a following now of more than 70 million people across those two platforms , @entity0 are way ahead of @entity11 in second place ( 47m ) , @entity12 ( 38m ) , @entity13 ( 30m ) and @entity14 ( 21m )			1
there is then a big drop - off before @entity53 in sixth ( 7.5m ) and another drop off before @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , each with between two and three million ‘ followers ’ on official social network platforms			2
no other teams have as many as two million , although every club in the country now has an official @entity17 and @entity18 presence and all clubs have at least tens of thousands of followers on these sites			0
@entity14 are the defending @entity68 champions but trail their rivals @entity0 in the money table the full details for all the clubs in @entity36 's study are in the accompanying tables			1
‘ big ’ clubs almost by definition will have lots of supporters of one kind or another ; increasingly these are spread around the world , fans whose primary engagement with the teams they follow being via television and the internet			0
it is notable how significant membership or recent membership of the @entity68 appears to be in influencing the number of social media followers			1
@entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 all make the top 20 in our list whereas multiple former @entity1 title winners including @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 do not			0
does that mean @entity92 are ‘ bigger ’ than @entity101 ? as a straightforward proposition , most neutrals would agree not			0
but it goes without saying the @entity92 , currently , as a stable , well - run @entity68 club are currently ‘ bigger ’ , ie : higher up , richer , better marketed to a worldwide audience as part of the global commodity that is the @entity68			0
similarly , any club currently in the @entity68 or there very recently is likely to be richer than clubs that are not and have not been			0
@entity0 lead the way in income , earning £ 433m in revenues last season , ahead of @entity14 in second place then @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
@entity120 , @entity92 , @entity96 and @entity121 all make the top 15 clubs on this measure where again the likes of @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity101 are in the lower reaches of the top 30 .			0

@entity0 are clear at the top of social media and money tables
they have almost *25* million more followers than the next club @entity11
@entity14 , the @entity68 champions , *lag* behind in fifth
@entity0 can also boast the highest income , ahead of @entity14 and @entity11
@entity36 's @entity141 is your club ? study finally settles great debate
