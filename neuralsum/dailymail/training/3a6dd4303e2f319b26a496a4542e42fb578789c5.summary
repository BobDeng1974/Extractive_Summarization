' mr @entity2 is a prolific graffiti vandal , ' he said			2
' we are not talking here about witty imaginative images such as those i expect you are familiar with by @entity82			2
' what you make of the graffiti in this case is a matter for you , but i would suggest what you are dealing with is simple damage			0
' it is damage which to the vast majority of the public is tedious and depressing			0
' of the @entity13 , he said : ' it is not owned by a large wealth corporation , it is run by volunteers for their pleasure			0
' if one of the trains gets damaged , they either have to get together the money to pay for repairs , or do the work themselves			0

' @entity2 had also created a series of @entity158 videos with @entity159 to throw detectives off the scent			0

but the jury saw images taken from @entity2 ' computers which show a white hand making the tag			0
