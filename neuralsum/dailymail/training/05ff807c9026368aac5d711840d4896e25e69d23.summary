@entity0 has criticised the @entity1 for punishing @entity2 over his explosive altercation with a fan – and blamed the security at @entity7 's @entity6			1
a video emerged of @entity2 telling one of his own fans to ' fuck off and die ' during their 3 - 1 defeat by @entity12 at the start of december			1
the @entity7 manager has since accepted an @entity1 charge of using ' abusive and / or insulting words towards a spectator , ' but @entity0 , whose @entity19 side host @entity2 's team on saturday , considers the punishment unfair			1
the @entity1 were wrong to punish @entity2 over his row with a fan , according to @entity0 @entity0 claimed @entity2 was let down by security inside the @entity6 ' i think that it depends on what position you ’re in at that moment in particular time and if somebody has baited you as much as that fella did then if you get a reaction , you get a reaction , ' @entity0 said			1
' we ’re all human beings are n’t we ? when you lose your rag , what do you do ? do you stay calm ? no. ' we can not be angels all the time in this badly politically correct world we have			0
this politically correct world drives you up the wall			0
we ’ll be shutting the door too hard soon			0
' i think [ the @entity1 charge ] is wrong , personally			1
he should get a warning about his future conduct , because he has n't stepped out of line before			0
but the @entity1 are just as scared as everyone else about being pc			2
' @entity0 admitted he has had altercations with fans in the past that were not caught on camera , but declined to elaborate further on them			2
the 60 - year - old worked with @entity2 for seven months at @entity57 , keeping him on as a coach when he took over at the club in 2007			2
@entity19 manager @entity0 said that he too had had confrontations with supporters during his career @entity2 worked as a coach under @entity0 back in 2007 when the latter was @entity57 manager the foxes have not won a @entity68 match since their surprise 5 - 3 win against @entity71 @entity72 added : ' it ’s up the clubs and the security system at the football club			1
i think @entity7 ’s security let @entity2 down because this lad was baiting him all the time so they should have gone over , nipped him by the collar and pushed him out and said do n’t bother coming back here			1
' it ’s what @entity71 have been doing for years to stop anything like that happening			0
fans are fans , up to a point			0
if a manager turned around pointed to a policeman and said , “ look , this guy ’s doing this , i want you to arrest him ” , that will cause mayhem			0
' @entity95 should look at that situation around where they dugout is and if somebody ’s being particularly , constantly verbally aggressive then the security should take the fan away and say it ’s not an acceptable behaviour			0
