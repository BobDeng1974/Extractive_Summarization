for thousands of years , 17 giant slabs of stone formed a bridge across a river in @entity4			1
the @entity5 were even said to have been built by the devil so he could sunbathe , according to legend - but that did n't stop them getting washed away in floods last year			1
today , engineers began the painstaking task of rebuilding the 180ft - long crossing , which some believe dates back to 1000 bc. situated on the @entity16 in @entity17 , it collapsed after being struck by a 10ft wall of flood water on december 22			1
anyone who tried to cross the bridge , it was said , did so at the risk that they would be killed by the devil , who swore an oath to crush anyone who passed from one side to the other			2
it is claimed that locals once sent a cat across the bridge to test the myth – and the animal was vaporised			2
only after confrontation with the local parson is the devil supposed to have withdrawn the threat			0
a construction crew has already moved some of the two - tonne slabs - each measuring up to 8ft - out of the water with heavy lifting machinery			2
each step had previously been numbered in the event that the grade i - listed structure was ever damaged , so the teams will carefully slot them back together in the coming days			1
the bridge , which links the @entity17 villages of @entity73 and @entity74 , was also washed away in 1952 and had to be rebuilt by the @entity75			1
following further damage in 1982 , two thick ' hawser ' cables were strung across the river to protect it - but both snapped during december 's floods			2
at the time , local resident @entity83 told the @entity84 : ‘ i have lived in the area for over 50 years and i have never seen anything like this before			0
‘ it must have been some mighty trees which were carried downstream and smashed through them			0

@entity114 , conservation manager for the @entity4 , was there when the swollen @entity16 washed away the historic stones			1
he said : ' it was the speed of the water - it was absolutely terrifying , it was moving so fast			0
' i 've worked on @entity4 for 20 years and i 've never seen it like that			0
for me , it was absolutely shocking			0

although the first recorded mention of the @entity5 was in the 14th century , some believe it could be far older video : @entity5 in @entity4 , a 3,000 - year - old iconic clapper bridge			1
