it sounds like the @entity1 for humankind ; a technique that could slow down ageing by up to half			1
now geneticists in @entity7 have found a way to achieve just that – albeit in a flower , and not a person			0
the breakthrough allows bouquets to remain fresh for much longer and could help unravel secrets on how to prevent cell decay in other organisms			0
@entity7 scientists say they have found a way to slow down the ageing process in flowers by up to a half , meaning bouquets could remain fresh for much longer researchers at the @entity23 and @entity24 in @entity25 , east of @entity26 , said they had found the gene believed to be responsible for the short shelf - life of flowers in one @entity7 variety of morning glory			1
' morning glory ' is the popular name for hundreds of species of flowering plants whose short - lived blooms usually unfold early in the day and are gone by nightfall			0
by suppressing the gene – named ' @entity40 ' – the lifespan of each flower was almost doubled , said @entity43 , one of the lead researchers in a study carried out jointly with @entity46 in southern @entity7			1
researchers at the @entity23 and @entity24 in @entity25 , east of @entity26 , said they had found the gene believed to be responsible for the short shelf - life of flowers in one @entity7 variety of morning glory ( pictured ) scientists in @entity7 suppressed the gene ' @entity40 ' to double the lifespan of @entity53 living to the ripe old age of 500 might be a possibility if the science shown to extend worms ' lives can be applied to humans , scientists have said			1
in december , @entity62 researchers tweaked two genetic pathways in the tiny lab worm @entity64 and boosted the creature 's lifespan by a factor of @entity69 research raises the prospect of anti-ageing treatments based on genetic interactions , they said			0
‘ what we have here is a synergistic five-fold increase in lifespan , ’ said lead scientist dr @entity73 , from the @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76			2
‘ the two mutations set off a positive feedback loop in specific tissues that amplified lifespan			0
‘ basically these worms lived to the human equivalent of 400 to 500 years			0
’ ' unmodified flowers started withering 13 hours after they opened , but flowers that had been genetically modified stayed open for 24 hours , ' he said			2
this means the plant has fresh purple flowers alongside the paler blooms from the previous day , he said			0
' we have concluded that the gene is linked to petal ageing , ' professor @entity43 told @entity98			1
the finding could lead to developing methods to extend the life of cut flowers , he added			1
' it would be unrealistic to modify genes of all kinds of flowers but we can look for other ways to suppress the ( target ) gene ... such as making cut flowers absorb a solution that prevents the gene from becoming active , ' professor @entity43 said			1
for some flowers , such as carnations , florists currently use chemicals to inhibit ethylene , a plant hormone which sometimes causes blooms to ripen			0
but ethylene is not involved in the ageing of some popular flowers , such as lilies , tulips and irises			2
a gene similar to @entity40 could be responsible for petal ageing in these plants , professor @entity43 said , meaning the ability to suppress it would extend their life			1

scientists *supressed* ' @entity40 ' gene to slow down ageing by half
find could lead to better techniques that extend the life of cut flowers
for *instance* , cut flowers could absorb a solution that prevents the gene from becoming active
