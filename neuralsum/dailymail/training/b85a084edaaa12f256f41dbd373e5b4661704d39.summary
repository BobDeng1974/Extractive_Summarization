search around on the internet and you can easily find thousands of images of severe weather , from fantastic bolts of lightning to giant tornadoes			1
but what is actually taking place in these images ? that ’s what a new book will be detailing , showing some of the incredible processes taking place in various superstorms			1
diagrams will reveal the formation of lighting , the inflow of wind into a storm and much more - alongside hundreds of high - resolution weather images			1
their amazing images will be overlayed with diagrams showing the motion of wind , precipitation and more			1
shown is a diagram detailing how a classic supercell storm forms @entity37 and @entity38 , from @entity25 , are currently seeking funding for their book ‘ @entity42 ’ on @entity43 , which was designed by @entity44			1
it will contain 200 high - resolution images of weather including tornadoes , lightning , supercell thunderstorms and more			2
the book , due to be released towards the end of the year , has clear page overlays so readers can view the images in their original form - and with the additional information on top			2
according to the team , it ‘ will also include detailed explanations of how and why severe weather occurs , historical references to past milestone weather events and storm chasing stories behind the scenes to give you an idea of how to capture these images			1
’ this diagram shows giant bolts of lightning , with the phenomenon labelled to show what is taking place the book has clear page overlays so readers can view the images in their original form - and with the additional information on top the team hope that their book will educate people on the dangers of certain weather formations , like tornadoes seen here known as the ' mother of tornadoes ' , a mesocyclone can be up to six miles wide and can produce as many as 60 tornadoes			1
these severe thunderstorms form where cold dry air meets warm moist tropical air			0
the wind coming into the storm starts to swirl and forms a funnel			2
the air in the funnel spins faster and faster and creates a very low pressure area which sucks more air - and objects - into it			0
if the cyclone runs out of wet , warm surface air , it dies out			0
if it does not run out of this fuel , however , the rotating cloud stretches toward the ground and may become a giant tornado			0
in one example , the anatomy of a classic supercell storm is shown			2
towards the bottom of the storm , large hail and heavy precipitation can be seen pouring down from the clouds onto the ground			0
an updraft in the cloud is also identified , while a cloud with an imminent tornado is shown forming near to the ground			0
another shows how giant bolts of lightning move from high in the clouds to @entity127			1
it highlights the positive charge at the start of the bolt , and a negative charge at the bottom			0
elsewhere , the team reveal the anatomy of a monsoon thunderstorm			0
at its base there is a warm inflow of air , while mammatus clouds form higher up			0
a terrifying tornadic supercell is also seen with a mesocyclone , while a dangerous cone tornado begins to form at the bottom			0
the book also contains a special section called @entity150 , which details their lightning research project , in which they fire probe - containing rockets into electrically charged storms in an attempt to initiate lightning			1
to collect images for the book , the team plans to begin storm chasing in the spring of this year to ‘ collect just the right images and have all the components in place			2

two @entity25 - based storm chasers are to release a book detailing how severe weather forms
their amazing images will be overlayed with diagrams showing the motion of wind , precipitation and more
one diagram shows the anatomy of a classic supercell with a mesocyclone inside
another shows giant bolts of lightning , with the phenomenon labelled to show what is taking place
and the team will also detail their probe - carrying rockets that they *launch* into clouds to induce lightning
