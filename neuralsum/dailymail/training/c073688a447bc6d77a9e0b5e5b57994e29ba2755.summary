@entity0 has agreed to become the @entity2 new manager , but only on the understanding he can revert to his academy role if it does n't work out			1
the 49 - year - old is ready to try and tame trigger - happy owner @entity6 by accepting a long - term deal at @entity8			1
@entity0 is back in charge of the first - team after @entity6 sacked @entity11 just 32 days after appointing him			1
@entity0 is expected to take permanent charge of @entity2 in the coming days @entity0 will want assurances that he can resume his job in the academy if the role does not work out the axing of the @entity18 was entirely in keeping with his past , with the controversial @entity20 having seen off 36 managers in 22 years with @entity20 side @entity22 , when @entity0 puts pen to paper , he will become the fourth permanent @entity2 boss in the last five months			1
the former @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 midfielder is willing to take the plunge , though , leaving behind his work with the club 's academy and trying to be the man who takes @entity2 back to the @entity35			1
speaking to the @entity36 , @entity0 said : ' i had a meeting with @entity39 today			2
nothing has been put down in concrete , but i wanted to see how he saw it going forward			0
' i do n't want this to be a short - term thing , that is no good for anybody			0
' he told me that he sees me here for the long haul and that he wanted me here with him and that he does not see this as a short - term thing			0
' i get on really well with him and work well with him and understand where he is coming from			0
he is genuinely trying to do well for the club and i can do with that			0
' @entity2 owner @entity6 appointed @entity11 last month , but sacked him after just 32 days @entity11 was appointed on a two - year deal but did not even last two months ... he is now contemplating his future @entity0 , who made over 1,000 appearances as a player , is best know for captaining @entity27 to the @entity35 , but he is a lifelong @entity2 fan whose ascent to the top job has been a long time in the making			1
in his fourth , and what appears to be final , spell as caretaker between @entity66 and @entity67 he picked up 10 points from 12 and was considered unlucky to miss out on the permanent job ahead of the latter			2
once @entity0 's appointment is formalised then @entity67 's brief reign will be completely consigned to the history books , although he says he will be paid until 2016 and as such is available to the club should they want him back			2
the 46 - year - old is beginning to contemplate rebuilding a career that only five weeks ago was being spent with @entity78 side @entity77 - a club where he is adored after a successful spell as a player			1
@entity2 ' loss to @entity83 at the weekend was the final straw for @entity6 , who sacked @entity67 afterwards @entity85 reacts while watching the game alongside @entity0 , who he will appoint permanently he says he can do so knowing @entity2 are still paying him , though , and was quoted as telling @entity88 : ' i still have a contract on paid leave			1
' during this time , i must be ready to take over the team if requested by the owner			0
' that technically opens the door for a return to @entity8 before the expiry of his contract in two years ' time - something not unheard of in @entity20			1
any return looks unlikely , however , with @entity6 - who appointed @entity67 saying ' he 's good looking ' - admitting he had made a mistake			1
@entity11 insists , though , that he does not regret making the move , having bought out his contract with @entity77 in order to head to @entity106			2
' in six games with the team i made a big step forward , ' he said			0
' it is true that we had bad results , but the day before the game we had praise from all sides on how the situation was improving			0
' i do not believe i made a mistake in joining @entity2			2
i just wish that someone would believe in me			0
' @entity6 said i 'm a loser ? he should look at my cv			2
' should @entity6 and @entity0 fall out , @entity2 's vice-president and @entity6 's son , @entity122 , believes he will return to his job at the academy			1
speaking to the @entity36 , he said : ' even if my father and him fall down he will go back to the academy			0
but i know he 's going to do a great job			0
' and according to @entity127 , the 32 days afforded to @entity67 is a long time compared to some who have worked for his dad			1
' i remember in @entity20 my dad sacked seven coaches in one year and one before the season had even started			0
this is not a record			0
