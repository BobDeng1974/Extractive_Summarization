by @entity0 for @entity1 a @entity3 fish has given scientists a glimpse of exactly how our ancestors took their first steps on land			1
researchers have struggled to understand how ancient fish used their bodies and fins in a terrestrial environment about 400 million years ago			1
now , they say the living fish , called @entity16 , show how a group of fish began exploring land and evolved into tetrapods – today 's amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals			1
the team of researchers raised juvenile @entity16 on land for nearly a year , with an aim to revealing how these ' terrestrialized ' fish looked and moved differently			1
the terrestrialized fish walked more effectively by placing their fins closer to their bodies , lifted their heads higher , and kept their fins from slipping as much as fish that were raised in water			0
but just how these ancient fish used their fishy bodies and fins in a terrestrial environment and what evolutionary processes were at play remain scientific mysteries			2
researchers at @entity54 published in the journal nature , turned to a living fish , called @entity16 , to help show what might have happened when fish first attempted to walk out of the water			1
@entity16 is an @entity3 fish that can breathe air , ' walk ' on land , and looks much like those ancient fishes that evolved into tetrapods			1
the team of researchers raised juvenile @entity16 on land for nearly a year , with an aim to revealing how these ' terrestrialized ' fish looked and moved differently			2
' stressful environmental conditions can often reveal otherwise cryptic anatomical and behavioural variation , a form of developmental plasticity ' , says @entity71 , a former @entity54 post-doctoral student who led the project , now at the @entity73			0
' we wanted to use this mechanism to see what new anatomies and behaviours we could trigger in these fish and see if they match what we know of the fossil record			0
' the face of our past : the terrestrialized fish walked more effectively by placing their fins closer to their bodies , lifted their heads higher , and kept their fins from slipping as much as fish that were raised in water			0
the fish showed significant anatomical and behavioural changes			0

' anatomically , their pectoral skeleton changed to became more elongate with stronger attachments across their chest , possibly to increase support during walking , and a reduced contact with the skull to potentially allow greater head / neck motion , ' says @entity113 , a @entity114 student and study collaborator			0
@entity16 reveals how a group of fish began exploring land and evolved into tetrapods – today 's amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals			1
' because many of the anatomical changes mirror the fossil record , we can hypothesize that the behavioural changes we see also reflect what may have occurred when fossil fish first walked with their fins on land ' , says @entity133 , @entity134 in @entity135 at @entity54 and an associate professor at the @entity137			2
the terrestrialized @entity16 experiment is unique and provides new ideas for how fossil fishes may have used their fins in a terrestrial environment and what evolutionary processes were at play			2
@entity133 adds , ' this is the first example we know of that demonstrates developmental plasticity may have facilitated a large - scale evolutionary transition , by first accessing new anatomies and behaviours that could later be genetically fixed by natural selection ' .			0
