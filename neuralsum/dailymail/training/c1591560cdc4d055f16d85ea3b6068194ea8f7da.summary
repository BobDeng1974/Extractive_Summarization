for more information : @entity134 @entity9 disease is a rare and usually fatal genetic disorder that causes progressive damage to the nervous system			1
in the most common form of the condition , symptoms usually begin at around five months of age , when a previously normal child ’s development begins to slow and they gradually lose their ability to move			0
other symptoms can include muscle stiffness and fits			0
the first noticeable symptom is usually that a baby is excessively surprised and startled by noises , such as people clapping their hands or a telephone ringing			0
a red spot may also appear near the centre of each of their eyes			0
babies with the condition will also be much slower in reaching developmental milestones , such as gripping objects and learning to crawl			0
@entity9 disease is caused by a genetic mutation			2
this happens when the instructions that are found in all living cells become ' scrambled ' in some way , causing one or more processes of the body not to work properly			0
in @entity9 disease , a genetic mutation known as the @entity174 mutation results in the body not producing an enzyme called @entity177 ( @entity178 )			2
without this enzyme , a fatty substance called ganglioside builds up in the cells of the nervous system , causing them to stop working normally , eventually killing them			0

@entity8 , 2 , had a @entity9 , a disorder that causes nerve cells to die
died last monday in children 's *hospice* after singing his favourite songs
his sister @entity17 arrived on friday , weighing 7lb 8oz
