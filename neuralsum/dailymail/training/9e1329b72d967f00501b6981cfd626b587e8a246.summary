by @entity0 published : 20:56 est , 6 january 2013 updated : 20:59 est , 6 january 2013 new parents should carry their baby upright and facing outwards to improve the youngster ’s development , a leading academic suggests			1
the technique allows a baby to observe the world as seen by his or her parents and could result in a more self - assured child			1
@entity13 - winning author @entity12 said @entity15 parents could learn a great deal from child - rearing techniques used in more traditional societies , including tribes in the @entity20 and @entity21 , who carry their babies around			1
instead of keeping their baby in a pram , new parents should keep a baby at chest height and facing outwards to improve their development unlike a pram , keeping baby at chest height and facing outwards where it can interact with the world could leave them more ‘ emotionally secure , self - confident , curious , and autonomous ’			1
the 75 - year - old author , a professor of geography at the @entity36 in @entity37 , bases most of his observations on half a century of visits to tribal communities such as in @entity41 , where he lived among people who were still using stone tools			2
in his latest book , @entity45 , he argues that babies have the same instincts as our ancient forebears , and so respond better to traditional rather than modern conditions			2
modern parents can achieve the carrying technique by using a papoose , which has enjoyed a rise in popularity in recent years			2
quickly comforting a crying baby , letting them sleep near their parents , and lots of physical contact are also beneficial , he says			0
‘ it is only relatively recently that some of these child - rearing practices became unfashionable			0
i suggest it ’s time to consider some of them seriously again , ’ he said			0
the professor , a father of two , added the methods have ‘ in effect already been tested by natural experiments : different societies have been raising their children differently for a long time , and we can see the results ’			0
his 1997 book , @entity75 , which attempts to explain why history unfolded so differently on the world ’s continents , won the @entity13 for non-fiction .			0
