under attack : the very revd @entity10 , until recently the @entity9 ( pictured , left , outside @entity29 ) , has been the target of abusive letters as the row over @entity6 's ( right ) final resting place rages under the terms of their licence to dig up the remains , the university 's scientists have decided @entity6 - killed at the @entity39 in 1485 - should be re-interred at @entity29			1
but other experts argue that the king himself would have wanted to be put to rest at @entity43 and that the remains should be moved to the city			1
@entity47 mp @entity46 said while the debate appeared good natured at first , it has now taken a more sinister turn after the @entity2 received such abusive letters she had to pass them to the police			1
calls : @entity47 mp @entity46 said while the debate appeared good natured at first , it has now taken a more sinister turn he has now called on the government to set up an independent panel of experts to make a decision once and for all			1
speaking during a debate in @entity64 , he said : ' i received many letters and emails from members of the public about this , supporting burial in @entity43			1
' most are thoughtful and well argued and based on scientific facts but some are frankly inflammatory and talking yesterday to the @entity2 , some that she has received at the minster are so extreme that she has referred the correspondence to the police			1
' i would say to everybody : calm down			0
let 's all respect the memory of a former king of our country			0
let 's discuss where his remains should be put to rest in a dignified and sober way			0

' nine of the monarch 's descendants have called on the government to return the remains of the king to @entity43 for a ' formal and ceremonial ' burial , while a petition calling for his remains to be transferred to the northern city has been signed by more than 23,000 people			1
mr @entity46 said : ' the decision should be taken on independent national advice and not delegated to archaeologists from @entity24 who clearly support the @entity24 cause			1
' they would find it outrageous if the decision was delegated to people from @entity43			2
we need the decision to be taken nationally , in the national interest by people who are independent of the vested interests of either @entity43 or @entity24			2
' but justice minister @entity116 said @entity43 itself supported the re-interment of the remains at @entity29			1

mr @entity116 said : ' now that the exhumation has been completed , it is the @entity24 's responsibility as holder of the licence to decide where @entity6 remains are finally laid to rest			2
' much has been made , not least today , of the fact that the people of @entity43 want the remains to be buried in @entity43 and i do understand the strength of feeling in @entity43 and @entity157 more widely			2
' however , i should make it clear that @entity43 has openly supported the re-interment of @entity6 's remains in @entity29			1
' it is also right i think to point out that the default position of the @entity163 ... is that the remains should be interred at the nearest christian church and that of course is in this case indeed @entity29			2
