@entity0 has ruled @entity1 out of the rest of the season after he underwent tests on his damaged metatarsal			1
the @entity7 midfielder was hurt in the 2 - 1 win over @entity9 last month but @entity0 was hopeful that @entity1 would be able to play some part in the final seven matches of the campaign			1
now , though , he has been forced to admit defeat with that plan			2
it is a blow for the @entity7 manager , whose side have staged a mini-revival in recent weeks , but he insists there is positive lining in that @entity1 , who missed almost all of @entity0 's first campaign with cruciate ligament damage , does not require surgery			1
@entity7 midfielder @entity1 will not play again this season after damaging his metatarsal @entity7 manager @entity0 expects @entity1 to return to pre-season in the best possible shape @entity0 now expects the former @entity30 midfielder to return to pre-season in the best possible shape and maintains he has a crucial role to play in @entity7 's future			1
' i do n't think we are going to see him this season , ' said @entity0			1
' but i am not too worried about that			2
it is a tricky injury because if you do n't heal it properly , it could come back			2
we need to make sure he is 100 per cent			1
if he is fully fit for pre-season , that would be fantastic			1
' @entity1 has been through a lot			1
we do n't have another player like him in the squad			2
we are trying to support him			2
he can add that calm feeling , he has shown his worth and what he is capable of adding			2
but it is tough , i wo n't lie			2
it is devastating for him			0
' we just have to look at the positive that he does n't need surgery , as at one point it looked very likely			0
' @entity0 , meanwhile , has admitted @entity60 is only ' 50/50 ' to be involved in saturday 's trip to @entity62 owing to a hamstring injury			1
the @entity69 international , whose future on @entity66 has been the subject of speculation , has only been making slow progress			0
@entity7 striker @entity60 is only ' 50/50 ' to be involved against @entity62 due to a hamstring injury we will give him as much time as we can , ' said @entity0			1
' it is still 50/50 as to whether he will make it			0
we need to make sure he is 100 per cent before we put him on the football pitch again			1
it is not a big problem but we do not want to take any risks with him			0
' but we are very strong in terms of numbers			0
the squad is developing really strong competition for places			0
we want everyone fit and available			1
the squad is big enough to cope with these problems			0
after the demands of @entity91 , we have fully focused on the league			0
' we have been able to cope with the mental fatigue			0
i do feel that we will learn and the focus is getting good momentum in the season			0
there are lessons to learn			0
we are now a more mature team			0
it 's been a tough season and we will learn our lesson			1
we want to continue our momentum			0
