there looked to be so much bend on @entity3 ’s shot on the half hour at the @entity4 on wednesday night that if there had been no net to stop the ball it would kept on curling until it ended up back at the great man ’s feet			1
the @entity11 scored his 33rd league goal of the season against @entity15 and with @entity16 heading in either side of two @entity19 goals - the first of which was almost a match for @entity3 's strike - @entity22 ran out comfortable 4 - 0 winners			1
@entity3 's opener was one of those fantasy football goals that have become so common place they are now being taken for granted			2
@entity22 star duo @entity19 ( right ) and @entity3 embrace as @entity22 take a seven - point lead in @entity29 the @entity22 no 10 loses his markers in the @entity15 penalty area before finishing with a trademark curled strike @entity22 talisman @entity3 wheels away after opening the scoring at the @entity4 during a 4 - 0 victory over @entity15 @entity19 followed @entity3 's lead by scoring a similar left - footed strike to double the @entity41 lead with the first of his two goals @entity22 defender @entity16 stuffs the ball under his shirt after netting a third with a headed goal on 75minutes @entity22 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : @entity49 ; @entity50 , @entity16 , @entity51 , @entity52 ; @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 ; @entity3 , @entity19 , @entity56			1
subs : @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 booked : @entity51 scorer : @entity66 ' , @entity67 ' , @entity16 75 ' , @entity68 ' @entity15 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity69 ; @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 ; @entity74 , @entity75 ; @entity76 ( @entity77 ) , @entity78 ( @entity79 ) , @entity80 ( @entity81 ) ; @entity82			2
subs : @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 @entity88 : @entity73 some grumbled that @entity15 ’s defence could have done more as he ambled in from the right touchline and sent his shot past @entity93 in the visitors ’ goal			0
other defences might have gone chasing the @entity22 number 10 and been left on the seats of their shorts , @entity15 ’s rearguard tried to hold a line just in front of the six - yard box but @entity3 ’s left foot shot whipped past them and bulged the back of @entity93 ’s net			1
not to be outdone , @entity19 first goal of the night was similar drifting in from the right on to a @entity50 pass and finding @entity93 ’s top right - hand corner just as his team - mate had before the break			1
defender @entity16 added a third and @entity19 scored his second with the last kick of the game as @entity22 stayed clear at the top with now just eight matches to play			1
@entity19 deserved his second half goals having been the brightest light for the home side early on			0
when a @entity55 through - ball put him in he should have scored			0
perhaps surprised by the fact that the flag had not been raised his shot was smothered by @entity93			0
@entity15 were playing their first game under the management of @entity129 who played over 400 games for @entity22 and coached in their youth academy when his opposite number @entity135 was in charger of the b - team			2
they almost scored with a @entity76 cross-shot that just crept past @entity49 ’s far post after @entity56 got a touch to it			0
they were breaking quickly with the pace of former @entity143 loanee @entity82 always a threat			0
@entity22 responded with @entity145 finding @entity3 in space on the right but after he accelerated into the area he gave possession away with an uncharacteristically heavy touch			2
@entity56 wrapped a cross-shot just wide of @entity93 ’s goal but still there was no breakthrough			0
it should have come on 24 minutes			0
@entity15 keeper @entity93 uses any means necessary to keep the ball away from former @entity158 forward @entity19 ( left ) @entity22 stalwart @entity54 ( right ) watches on as team - mate @entity3 tries a rare attempt using his head @entity162 international @entity56 ( centre ) was given an opportunity after @entity64 was dropped to the bench to cope with hectic schedule everyone on the pitch can only watch as @entity3 's stunning left - foot strike curls into the bottom corner of the net @entity171 full - back @entity50 rushes to congratulate team - mate @entity3 after he gives @entity22 a first half lead the @entity174 phenomenon celebrates scoring his 33rd league goal of the season so far @entity22 were without @entity64 , resting on the bench alongside @entity61 , but @entity3 , @entity19 and @entity56 should have linked to score on 24 minutes			1
@entity3 weaved in from the right flank , @entity19 got the better of @entity72 and pulled the ball back across the face of the six - yard box but @entity56 failed to anticipate the pass and it ran to safety			1
it looked as if @entity22 would reach half - time without the breakthrough then @entity3 broke through and @entity15 ’s resistance was broken for good			1
@entity82 raced away and @entity51 risked a straight red by barging him off the ball as he looked like leaving the @entity11 and the covering @entity53 behind			0
he was shown a yellow and @entity15 wasted the free - kick but they offered little going forward after the break			0
when @entity19 scored 10 minutes into the second half only @entity22 ’s unwillingness to go up through the gears kept the score down			2
@entity16 headed in goal number three with what was @entity22 ’s 14th set - piece goal of the season before @entity19 made it four			1
with set - piece strikes coach @entity135 and his assistant @entity202 have managed to add a new weapon to the @entity22 armoury			0
if they do n’t do you with the magic of @entity3 and @entity19 then they do you from a dead ball			2
@entity15 had succumbed to all three threats			0
@entity211 and @entity22 defender @entity212 ( centre ) was at the @entity4 to watch his old team @entity19 takes a leaf from @entity3 's book by cutting in from the right before unleashing a stunning left - footed shot @entity219 and @entity3 embrace after taking a 2 - 0 lead on 55minutes at the @entity4 @entity19 leaps into @entity3 's arms after the pair 's sensational opening strikes put the hosts in control @entity22 manager @entity135 , who was coming up against former team - mate in @entity15 manager @entity129 , instructs his team young defender @entity16 ( left ) heads home at the far post to stretch @entity22 's lead to 3 - 0 going into the final 15minutes veteran midfielder @entity54 stumbles under pressure from @entity15 players as @entity22 look to see out the game @entity19 wheels away after tapping in his second from close range in injury time to complete the 4 - 0 rout the @entity242 international thanks winger @entity56 for finding him with the cross for @entity22 's final goal			1

@entity22 *temporarily* opened up a seven - point lead over @entity247 at the top of @entity29
@entity174 superstar @entity3 opened the scoring with a trademark curled finish after *33minutes*
second - placed @entity247 play @entity255 later on wednesday evening to close the seven - point gap
@entity19 doubled the @entity41 's lead with a similarly curling left - footed stunner after the interval
@entity22 defender @entity16 netted the third with a far post header from @entity54 's whipped in cross
former @entity158 striker @entity19 tapped in a late goal from @entity56 's cross in injury time to complete the rout
