the ' @entity0 ' : exciting new evidence suggests the innocent - looking teenager in the simple white dress may really be the famous author a portrait of a pretty 13 - year - old girl claimed to be @entity6 has divided art experts for years			1
but exciting new evidence has now emerged that the innocent - looking teenager in the simple white dress may really be the famous author , on a visit to @entity10 in 1789			2
an analysis of the oil painting using digital photographic tools has revealed writing that seems to back up the case for it being a genuine likeness of the 19th century novelist			1
no other professional portrait of the writer has ever been verified - with only two artworks drawn by amateur hands confirmed as having been produced from life			0
but now , analysts have discovered the name @entity6 in the top - right corner of a reproduction of a photograph of the portrait of the teenager , taken before the painting was restored , according to @entity30			1
beside it , in two places , is the name @entity34			0
mr @entity34 was an established portrait painter of the period , a member of the @entity38 and a friend of several popular artists of the day , including @entity41 and @entity42			0
the words have been digitally enhanced using methods that were independently validated by @entity45 of @entity46 in @entity47 , who has spent more than 20 years analysing photographic evidence in criminal cases			0
of the two verified amateur artworks , one is a watercolour and pencil sketch by @entity56 's sister @entity55 , said to make the young woman look a little cross			2
the other is an ' idealised ' portrait used as the frontispiece to the @entity56 memoir written by her nephew in 1870			0
art critic @entity65 , a former curator of an exhibition dedicated to the author , said : ' to have all these words revealed on the canvas is very , very strong			1
' i think you 'd be flying in the face of reason to deny this			0
' there have been various other claims to have found likenesses of the author taken before her death in 1817 aged 41 , but all have been the subject of furious dispute			0
' unrealistic ' : the two verified portraits of the author from her lifetime - left , an ' idealised ' painting from the cover of a memoir by her nephew , and right , a ' cross ' watercolour and pencil sketch by her sister @entity55 in december , @entity56 biographer dr @entity92 claimed in @entity94 documentary @entity6 : the @entity95 ? that she had found a sketch at auction that was the much - loved author , but she has not yet proved her case to universal satisfaction			1
the painting of the young girl is owned by the @entity104 family , direct descendants of one of @entity6 's brothers			1
arguments : biographer dr @entity92 claimed in a @entity94 documentary that this sketch was produced before the novelist 's death it came to light in the late 19th century and the family say it was composed while the @entity118 were visiting @entity6 's great uncle @entity119 in @entity10 in 1789 , when the girl was 13			1
according to the recorded family history , having commissioned the portrait @entity119 kept it in @entity124 with the rest of his family collection			0
it was then given by his grandson , colonel @entity128 , to a close friend as a wedding present , the year after the author died in 1817 , because the bride was reported to be a keen admirer of @entity56 's books			2
but since the , art experts , led by the @entity136 , have raised objections - mainly that the style of the girl 's dress and the general composition date the painting to after 1800 , when @entity6 would have been in her 20s			1
but the new evidence could contradict that view			0
artist mr @entity34 went blind in 1797 and stopped painting			2
the photo even seems to reveal the date 1789			2
the writing could have been put on the canvas by mr @entity34 himself or a later owner			1
but as the painting was believed to be by a more prestigious artist , @entity155 , experts believe the words must have been put there during or shortly after @entity6 's lifetime			1
professor @entity159 of @entity160 said : ' whether @entity34 's name was signed by himself in the 18th century and / or by some other hand later , the attribution must be contemporaneous with @entity56 's lifetime or by people who knew @entity56 when she was alive			2
' if the portrait is confirmed as being @entity56 , it may be an embarrassment to the @entity136 , which granted the picture a licence for sale abroad on the basis that it could not be the writer			0
the gallery chose not to comment .			0

only two existing images of novelist from her lifetime and both are by amateurs
digital analysis has revealed writing on the canvas that says ' @entity6 ' , the artist 's name and ' 1789 '
