by @entity0 for @entity1 it appears the government 's key @entity4 plank of a $ 7 gp co-payment is dead in the water , or at least , that 's what @entity8 believes			1
' we ’re not going to have a co-payment of even one cent , ' mr @entity8 said			1
' there ’ll be none			0
is n’t that good ? ' this news came as a hammer blow for the government , which was still talking up a possible deal as latest as this morning			0
' all of @entity19 do n’t need to worry any more , ' said the billionaire mp			2
' the co-payment is dead			0
we wo n’t be supporting it			0
it ’s over , finished			0
billionaire mp @entity8 has delivered the bad @entity4 news to the government today that ' we are not going to have a co-payment of even one cent ' @entity32 was still talking up a deal on the @entity35 co-payment plan as late as this morning ' that is what we 're working towards '			1
that was until @entity8 arrived to tell the @entity40 that ' the co-payment is dead , we wo n't be supporting it ' mr @entity8 continued , suggesting the co-payment had now been consigned to history			1
' you can talk to all the analysts and crunch all the numbers you want but the fact of the matter is the @entity51 will not be changing their position and the co-payment will not be getting through			0
' we have been inundated with calls from real @entity19 and the message is very clear that they do not want it			2
' it is another cost they simply ca n’t afford and the @entity60 can not allow more pain to be inflicted on ordinary @entity19 who are already doing it tough under @entity32			0
' low income earners , single parent families , pensioners , nursing home patients and those who are socially or financially disadvantaged will be hardest hit by a gp co-payment			2
' it is a ruthless attack on @entity19 when savings can be made elsewhere in the budget			1
“ there is zero chance of the @entity60 supporting it in the @entity74 , ” mr @entity8 added			1
mr @entity8 has long lobbied for co-payment provisions to be altered , particularly for pensioners			1
last week mr @entity32 repeated the @entity40 's stance though			0
' we do n’t exempt pensioners from a @entity81 co-payment			1
their co-payment is normally a little less than the co-payment that the public faces , ' he said			0
' i do n't think it 's unreasonable for a comparable amount to be paid for visits to the gp			2
' the proposal announced in the @entity92 deemed that all patients would pay a $ 7 fee , but concession card holders and children would be bulk - billed after paying the fee 10 times in a year			1
today , mr @entity32 remained confident the co-payment would get through			0
' we certainly think it should , this is what we ’re working towards , ' he said			0
but without support from @entity60 , the government will be hard pressed to breathe life back into the co-payment plan which was a major chunk of the $ 10.5 billion cut to health spending			2
the @entity35 plan alone was forecast to save $ 3.5 billion over four years .			1

@entity8 says ' tell all @entity19 they do n't need to worry any more , it 's history '
$ 7 @entity35 co-payment was a key plank of the @entity115 announced in may
*treasurer* @entity117 had been *banking* on up to $ 3.5 billion in savings over the four - year *period* from the plan
' we 're not going to have a co-payment of even one cent ' says @entity8
major stumbling block is the @entity128 *refusal* to exempt pensioners from the $ 7 gp fee
mr @entity8 has called it ' a ruthless attack on @entity19 ' and claims savings will be have to be found elsewhere in the budget
