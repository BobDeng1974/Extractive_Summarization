a pregnant mother whose waters broke at just 23 weeks refused to abort her unborn child despite suffering three serious setbacks , with doctors warning that each time that the baby would not survive			1
medics offered @entity7 , 29 , a termination because they feared her baby would suffer fatal abnormalities caused by a lack of amniotic fluid , which protects and helps the baby 's development in the womb			1
when her waters broke a fortnight later , they were so convinced the baby 's lungs would be too small for her to breathe they called in a specialist bereavement midwife to comfort the couple			1
mrs @entity7 , 29 , gave birth to daughter @entity22 despite three complications so serious doctors warned her unborn baby would not survive after being born at 24 weeks - the legal abortion limit - @entity27 spent 100 days in hospital mrs @entity7 , from @entity29 in @entity30 then suffered a placental abruption , a serious complication where bleeding is found in the placenta as it comes away from the womb , which could have killed both her and the baby			1
but incredibly mrs @entity7 and husband @entity38 's ' miracle daughter ' @entity22 survived and now at nine - months - old is hitting all her developmental targets			1
' she had so many different things that were stacking up against her			0
she is our miracle baby			0
' said mrs @entity7 , who lives with her husband and their four other children @entity44 , eight , @entity47 , six , @entity48 , three , and @entity49 , two			2
mrs @entity7 's pregnancy appeared to be progressing normally until a routine scan at the @entity52 ( @entity53 ) @entity54 in @entity55 last @entity56 revealed a terrifying complication			1
@entity22 was sent home with an oxygen tank			2
although she was born with chronic lung disease , doctors hope that as her lungs grow the diseased part will be minimised and she will suffer nothing more than asthma mrs @entity7 said : ' when we went for the 20 - week scan we found there was no fluid around her and they thought there was some sort of abnormality causing the lack of fluid			1
' during pregnancy , a baby is cushioned inside a bag filled with amniotic fluid in the womb , which protects the baby from being hurt from a blow to the stomach , help 's the baby 's lungs and digestive system to mature and protects against infection			1
doctors were not able to say what caused the lack of fluid in mrs @entity7 's womb , although they believe the stress of her father 's death the previous month could have been a contributing factor			1
a week later the foetal medicine unit at the @entity54 in @entity96 offered her a termination			0
doctors said that a lack of amniotic fluid usually means the baby has suffered abnormalities that would make survival impossible			1
but the couple refused an abortion			0
' we did n't even have to talk about it , ' said mrs @entity7			2
' it was one of those things we would never have even considered			0
it did n't even enter our thoughts			0
' she was for another appointment a fortnight later , but she did not make it as her waters broke inexplicably at 23 weeks and she was admitted to the @entity115			2
' when we had been for the scan there was no fluid at all			0
but when my waters broke at 23 weeks it was just like it was with the others			2
it was a gush and i could n't understand			0
babies born before the 24 week legal limit for abortion do not usually survive , and doctors feared @entity22 's lungs would be too small and stiff for her to breathe on her own or even for medics to ventilate her			1
mrs @entity7 and her husband @entity38 call @entity22 their ' miracle baby ' and are fundraising for the family support group at the hospital 's baby unit mrs @entity7 said doctors started to prepare her for her baby 's death			1
she said : ' they thought i would deliver the baby and we had the bereavement midwife come and talk to us			0
it was a bit overwhelming			0
' but her labour did not progress as expected and as her pregnancy neared 24 weeks she was transferred to @entity147 in @entity148			0
she was put on complete bed rest and received steroid injections to help reduce the severity of @entity22 's lung problems			0
a scan in mid-december revealed @entity22 had all her limbs , but doctors could still not be certain she would not have any of the serious problems with muscles and bones that can be caused by a lack of amniotic fluid			1
after eating their @entity163 dinner on the hospital ward as it was too dangerous for mrs @entity7 to leave , the family had to face yet another problem with the pregnancy			1
now , at nine - months - old , @entity22 is thriving and is even hitting all her developmental targets on january 13 mrs @entity7 suffered placental abruption , a potentially - fatal complication where the placenta comes away from the inside of the womb , causing bleeding			1
doctors carried out an emergency caesarean section and @entity22 was born weighing just 2lb 6oz			1
despite being born with chronic lung disease , @entity22 did not have any of the problems with her limbs or spine which medics had feared			2
after almost 100 days in the special care baby units in both @entity183 and then the @entity53 hospitals she was allowed home in april with an oxygen tank			1
since then her oxygen support has been reduced , although she still needs it at night , and @entity22 has continued to go from strength to strength			2
mrs @entity7 said doctors hope that as her lungs grow the diseased part will be minimised and @entity22 will suffer nothing more than asthma			1
she said : ' the amount of hospital appointments is getting less and less			0
' ' and at the moment she is hitting all the targets she should be			0
with premature babies they should have caught up with their peers by two years			0
' ' we call her the happy wheezer and considering what she has been through , she is so happy ' said mr @entity206 she her husband have now begun fundraising for a support group set up by the special care baby nurses who looked after @entity22			2
she said : ' there are so many bad stories and so much negative press , but if it was n't for them myself and @entity22 would n't be here today			0
' we will never be able to repay them for what they have done for us , but it 's just something to say thank you and that their work is appreciated			0
' mr @entity223 - who works for @entity224 in @entity55 and has recently completed the @entity226 race to raise more than Â£ 300 for the family support group at the @entity115 special care baby unit			1
mr @entity223 said : ' a couple of oxygen tubes are nothing compared to what we were prepared for			0
we did n't know what to expect , but we had prepared ourselves for the worst case scenario			0
' we call her the happy wheezer and considering what she has been through , she is so happy			0
' mrs @entity7 added : ' one of the nurses said that she has seen some defects in similar situations where they are incompatible with life , so we are really lucky			2
