deal : @entity1 is prepared to sell the @entity3 s shares in @entity4 and @entity5 at a loss in order to bring about the biggest privatisation in @entity10 history @entity1 is prepared to sell the government ’s shares in @entity4 and @entity5 at a loss in order to bring about the biggest privatisation in @entity10 history			1
senior @entity16 sources yesterday said that @entity17 had spent too much money on the 2008 bailouts , which injected £ 66billion of public funds into the failing banks			1
they spoke after fresh reports the chancellor is gearing up to sell an 82 per cent shareholding in @entity4 and a 39 per cent stake in @entity5			1
the @entity26 first revealed in february that mr @entity1 wants to offload the shares before the 2015 election – and that he is examining the possibility of giving the shares away			0
that would mean acknowledging taxpayers would not get all their money back , since the share prices of the two banks currently mean the deficit on paper is £ 24billion			1
several treasury ministers believe a big privatisation would show the @entity40 is drawing a line under the financial crisis and would boost confidence in the economy			0
they hope that selling off – or giving away – the shares would kickstart trading in @entity4 and @entity5 shares and drive up the price , allowing them to get more money back			1
but a minister close to the chancellor told the @entity53 it was ‘ unrealistic ’ to expect the @entity4 share price to return to its 2008 level in the foreseeable future and the government may have to sell while the shares were ‘ under water ’			1
insiders say mr @entity1 is prepared to make the argument that it would be better to get some money back and move on , rather than wait around with the bank shares on the public balance sheet with little prospect of ever getting taxpayers ’ money back			0
a senior @entity16 source told the @entity26 : ‘ it is true @entity17 hugely overpaid for the original recapitalisation			2
’ for sale : the chancellor is gearing up to sell off a 39 per cent stake in @entity5 bleak outlook : the chancellor told the @entity53 it was ¿ unrealistic ¿ to expect the @entity4 share price to return to its 2008 level in the foreseeable future it was reported earlier this week that mr @entity1 ’s team hope former @entity17 chancellor @entity78 will be criticised for paying over the odds by the cross-party parliamentary banking standards commission when it reports in june			1
that will make it easier to argue that the government should sell its shares under the break - even mark			0
ripped off : former @entity17 chancellor @entity78 will be criticised for paying over the odds by the cross-party parliamentary banking standards commission when it reports in june but mr @entity78 has criticised the attempt to point the finger of blame at @entity17 , saying that in april 2010 – just before the last election – @entity4 shares were trading above the price the @entity95 paid			1
‘ i ’ve not the slightest doubt all of this is a rather obvious attempt to blame the last @entity17 government for whatever they do , ’ he said			2
‘ the share price we see today is largely of their own making			0
’ but there have also been rumours that the cross-party commission on banking standards , led by @entity16 mp @entity109 , might recommend splitting @entity4 into a ‘ good ’ high street bank , with a ‘ bad ’ bank taking on its toxic loans			2
the archbishop of @entity114 , who is a member of the commission , has said he would like to see @entity4 broken up into a series of regional banks			0
sources at @entity4 said any sell - off was a decision for the government but bank bosses were not adverse to moves that hasten a return to the private sector			2
a @entity95 spokesman said : ‘ this is all speculation			0
we will sell our stakes when it is in the taxpayers ’ interest to do so			0
