by @entity1 reporter published : 18:11 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 18:20 est , 10 july 2013 for most couples who are planning their wedding day , building a pirate ship to host the ceremony on is not near the top of their list of things to do			1
however , an @entity10 man is busy putting the finishing touches to a pirate ship he has built in his front yard after convincing his fiancee to let him realize his boat - building dreams			1
@entity16 and @entity17 are due to get married on board the boat , which sits in a pond the couple dug in the garden of their @entity24 home , next month			1
plain sailing : @entity16 is building a pirate ship that he plans to get married on dream project : @entity16 and his fiancee @entity17 survey their pirate ship miss @entity17 said she had never taken her fiance 's boat ambitions seriously , but when he suggested it for their @entity37 - themed wedding it seemed like the perfect idea			1
' i always wanted to get married outside , ' she told @entity41			2
' so one thing led to another , and we bought the backhoe to start digging for the pond			1
' crew mates : @entity17 and @entity16 are due to get married on their ship in august however , the couple 's plans were nearly scuppered by @entity53 officials who said they lacked the right permit for such a structure			1
' when i approached them , they said , " we ca n’t do anything because we have nothing for pirate ships " , ' mr @entity16 said			2
' but now they do			2
it ’s called an " accessory structure "			2
’ although work had to temporarily stop while the permit issue was resolved , mr @entity16 says he has been given the full backing of the county , which worked hard to help him fix the paperwork			2
' we are 100 per cent behind them			0
i think it ’s a wonderful thing , ' @entity72 , director of development services for @entity53 , said			0
' a lot of people in the community appreciate the ship , and the reason behind it is quite meaningful			0
' mr @entity16 added : ' it ’s something i ’ve always wanted to build			2
something really unique and big and i could tinker around with for a while			0
' the 35 - year - old , who proposed to his fiancee last may , added that he wakes up smiling every day because his dream has come true			0
he added that before building the 23ft high , 53ft long ship , which is attached to a concrete platform and has been named @entity90 , he had no ship building experience			1
' i did n't know anything about ships , but i studied them a lot and it was fun to do , ' he told @entity97			0
' it was a hobby of mine in the winter			0
i took different types of ships and collaborated my favorite parts of each ship into one			0
' strong foundations : @entity16 is building the pirate ship on a concrete platform in a pond that he dug labor of love : the ship is based on a combination of a galleon and a frigate ship shape : although the couple will marry on the ship , the wedding will not have a pirate theme the final design , which is a combination of a galleon and a frigate , will be able to hold about 30 people			1
' it 's definitely over the top			0
i definitely always wanted an outside wedding , but definitely never pictured being married on a pirate ship , ' miss @entity17 said , adding that the ship is the only pirate element to their wedding on august 3			1
' my mom asked to bring eye patches to the wedding and i said , " no ! the pirate ship is enough "			1
i want flowery , and pretty			0
i do n’t people there with swords acting like @entity139 , she said .			0
