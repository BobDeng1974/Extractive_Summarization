a new way of measuring precise distances to galaxies tens of millions of light years away has been developed - using a distant galaxy dubbed the @entity4			1
researchers accurately measured the distance to the galaxy , formally known as @entity8 , by comparing the physical size of the dust ring around its black hole with the perceived sized seen from @entity12			1
and the galaxy - with a distance now known to be 62 million light - years - can be used as a ' cosmic marker ' in the universe to work out the distance to other celestial objects			1
powerful x-rays generated by a super-massive black hole produced the bright blue ' pupil ' of the eye , while the red halo around the pupil is made up of hydrogen atoms one of the major problems in astronomy is measuring very large distances in the universe			1
the current , most common methods measure relative distances by using markers known as ' standard candles ' - which are stars with a known luminosity whose distance can be measured			1
but now research from the @entity42 and @entity43 in @entity44 has demonstrated that precise distances can be measured using supermassive black holes			2
by combining the light from the two 10 - meter @entity50 telescopes on @entity51 on @entity52 using a method called interferometry , the scientists could achieve an effective resolution equivalent to a telescope with a perfect 85 - metre diameter mirror			0
this provides very high resolution - a hundred times better resolution than the @entity61 - and allows them to measure the angle the dust ring of the @entity4 made in the sky			0
by now combining data about the observed size of the dust ring on the sky with the known physical size of 30 light days , the distance from the @entity12 can be calculated by using simple geometry			2
' we calculated the distance to be 62 million light - years , ' said dr @entity75 from the @entity43 , who was involved in the research			1
' the previous calculations based on redshift [ a change in the wavelength of the light due to the velocity of the object away from us ] were between 13 million and 95 million light - years , so we have gone from a great deal of uncertainty to now being able to determine the precise distance			1
' this is very significant for astronomical calculations of cosmic scale distances			0
' dr @entity92 , from the @entity42 , created the method which is similar to what land surveyors use on @entity12			0
it works by measuring the physical and angular , or ' apparent ' , size of a standard ruler in the galaxy , to calibrate the distance from this information			2
the research , which is published in the journal nature , was used to identify the accurate distance of the ' nearby ' ngc 4151 galaxy , which was n't previously known			0
the galaxy @entity8 , which is dubbed the @entity4 by astronomers for its similarity to the film 's depiction of the eye of the character in @entity114 , is important for accurately measuring black hole masses			1
indeed , as in the famous saga , a ring plays a crucial role in this new measurement			0
all big galaxies in the universe host a supermassive black hole in their centre and , in about a tenth of all galaxies , these supermassive black holes are growing by swallowing huge amounts of gas and dust from their surrounding environments			1
in this process , the material heats up and becomes very bright - becoming the most energetic sources of emission in the universe known as active galactic nuclei ( @entity137 )			0
the hot dust forms a ring around the supermassive black hole and emits infrared radiation , which the researchers used as the ruler			1
however , the apparent size of this ring is so small that the observations were carried out using infrared interferometry			0
this involved combining the twin 33ft ( 10 metres ) telescopes of the @entity50 in @entity52 to achieve the resolution power of a 280ft ( 85 metres ) telescope			0
the galaxy @entity8 is dubbed the @entity4 by astronomers for its similarity to the film 's depiction of the eye of the character in @entity114 ( shown ) , and it is important for accurately measuring black hole masses			1
indeed , as in the famous saga , a ring plays a crucial role in this new measurement the measurement was made using the two 33ft ( 10 metres ) @entity50 ( shown ) on @entity51 on @entity52 via a method called interferometry			0
this involved combining the two telescopes to get a resolution power equivalent to a 280ft ( 85 metres ) telescope to measure the physical size of the dusty ring , the researchers measured the time delay between the emission of light from very close to the black hole and the infrared emission			1
this delay is the distance the light has to travel ( at the speed - of - light ) from close to the black hole out to the hot dust			2
by combining this physical size of the dust ring with the apparent size measured with the data from the @entity50 , the researchers were able to determine a distance to the galaxy recently reported distances ranged from 13 million to 95 million light - years , but using this new method the researchers now know the galaxy is 62 milion light - years from @entity12			1
when the gas falls in towards the black hole , it is heated up and emits ultraviolet radiation , which in turn heats up the surrounding dust cloud			0
using telescopes on @entity12 , scientists measured the time difference between the light from the black hole and the light from the dust cloud , 30 days , to work out its distance dr @entity92 said : ' one of the key findings is that the distance determined in this new fashion is quite precise - with only about 10 per cent uncertainty			1
' in fact , if the current result for @entity8 holds for other objects , it can potentially beat any other current methods to reach the same precision to determine distances for remote galaxies directly based on simple geometrical principles			0
' moreover , it can be readily used on many more sources than the current most precise method			0
' ' such distances are key in pinning down the cosmological parameters that characterise our universe or for accurately measuring black hole masses			2
' indeed , @entity8 is a crucial anchor to calibrate various techniques to estimate black hole masses			2
our new distance implies that these masses may have been systematically underestimated by 40 per cent			0
' dr @entity92 , together with colleagues in @entity44 and @entity237 , is currently setting up a new programme to extend their work to establish precise distances to a dozen galaxies in this new way and use them to constrain cosmological parameters to within a few per cent			2
in combination with other measurements , this will provide a better understanding of the history of expansion of our universe .			0

@entity253 devised a new method to measure distances in the universe
he worked out the distance to @entity8 - dubbed the ' @entity4 '
this *spiral* galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its centre
by comparing its actual size to its ' observed size ' the galaxy was found to be 62 million light - years away
@entity8 can now be used as a so - called cosmic distance marker
and more than a dozen galaxies will be measured with the new method
this could provide more information on the history of the universe
measuring distances in the universe is *difficult* and usually relies on ' standard candles ' - stars whose distances are already known
