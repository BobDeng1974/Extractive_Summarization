' binmen in parts of @entity8 have been banned from carrying rubbish bags just a few yards to their trucks -- for health and safety reasons it comes after householders complained some of their rubbish was going uncollected			1
local @entity30 councillor @entity29 said the edict was ‘ a complete c * * k - up ’			1
he said : ' how is it all right for an old person to carry their bin bags to somewhere else and not all right for a binman to do the same ? ' that seems bizarre and contradictory			1
' why do n’t they just send a smaller truck round ? ' instead , we ’ve got rubbish going uncollected			0
