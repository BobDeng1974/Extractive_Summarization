by @entity0 published : 06:02 est , 23 october 2013 updated : 08:23 est , 23 october 2013 two friends died within half an hour of one another after taking a super-strength ecstasy drug nicknamed ' dr death '			1
car welder @entity5 , 30 , said he could not see and cried ' get out of my body ' before he and @entity8 , 21 , collapsed and died following a night out in @entity9 , @entity10			1
an inquest heard the pair took up to five times the lethal dose of @entity14 ( @entity14 ) - almost certainly without realising what it was			1
cocktail : an inquest heard @entity5 , 30 , and @entity8 , 21 , drank heavily and took other drugs , including the former legal high mephedrone - but it was the super-strength ecstasy @entity14 which proved fatal the pair had taken a crystal form of the drug @entity14 , nicknamed dr @entity24 , similar to the one pictured above			1
it also comes in the form of pink tablets			0
the drug has reportedly claimed the lives of a number of young clubbers @entity33 dr @entity32 said : ' i suspect people buy this drug when they are looking for something else			1
it can lead to high blood pressure , hallucinations , coma , seizures and there is no specific treatment			0
' these things come with no quality control or testing whatsoever			0
one of the dangers is that it is slow in effect so people tend to think nothing much has happened so they take another			0
' three of the pair 's friends were also taken to hospital for side effects of a mixture of drink and drugs			2
the inquest heard mr @entity5 , a car welder , and ms @entity8 , a finance worker , met friends for a night out in @entity9 on april 28 this year for a friend moving to the @entity66 resort of @entity67 they had gone out separately but met in a club where they drank alcohol and took drugs , including mephedrone and cocaine			1
they then headed to a friend ’s house in the early hours			2
the pair and another friend ran out of drugs so they went to @entity5 ’ home , where he said he had ‘ whizz ’ , a term used to describe amphetamine			1
the drug was in fact a pale crystal - like form of @entity14 , which is also known to come in the form of pink tablets nicknamed ' pink ecstasy '			1
they also took the former legal high mephedrone , nicknamed ' bubble ' , which was initially blamed for the pair 's death			0
however , the inquest ruled out mephedrone as the fatal drug			2
@entity101 , who was on the night out , told the inquest : ' we were in the club and @entity8 and her friend bought some coke and shared it in the toilets			1
dangerous : the drug has been linked to at least 10 deaths in the @entity10 area , including those of @entity5 , left , and @entity8 , right			1
experts say it is often sold as ecstasy and without revellers noticing the house in @entity9 , @entity10 , where @entity5 and @entity8 took lethal doses of the dr @entity24 drug			1
friends said 30 - year - old @entity5 complained he was hot and was cooling himself with a fan family photo : @entity8 with her mother @entity122 , who is pictured above right leaving the inquest at @entity124			1
coroner @entity125 told her : ' i ca n’t imagine the pain of losing a child and i am so sorry ' ' we went back to our friend ’s house at about 3am where she and @entity132 finished off the coke and the rest of the bubble			1
our friend went to bed and the rest of us stayed until about 6am			2
' we then decided to get some more drugs			0
@entity5 said he had some whizz at his house , so me , him , @entity8 and another friend went there			1
' we all took some amphetamine in a cigarette paper and swallowed it			0
@entity5 had two to start with when everybody else had one			1
we all felt quite spaced out			0
it did n’t feel the same as when i had taken it once before			0
@entity14 has been blamed for the deaths of more than 10 young people within a 60 - mile radius of @entity10 this year			1
it is better - known in the form of pills costing as little as £ 3			2
they are sometimes pink and shaped like @entity161 sweets , or stamped with an 'm '			0
it also comes in a crystal - like form , pictured above			2
the drug often has the same street names as ecstasy as it has a similar effect to ecstasy 's main chemical , @entity171			1
but the active ingredient in @entity14 is five times stronger and takes longer to kick in , meaning many revellers take extra pills			1
the youngest known victim was 16 - year - old @entity176 , who died after suffering breathing difficulties at a friend ’s house in @entity180			1
nine recent deaths in the north - west have been linked to possible contaminated ecstasy			1
@entity14 has also been linked to deaths in @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187			2
gym instructor @entity188 , from @entity189 , was just 19 when he suffered a violent fatal reaction to @entity14			2
his mother , dr @entity191 , said after an inquest : ‘ i would say [ to young people ] just do n’t do it and please avoid all drugs			0
' it ’s like playing @entity197 with your life			0
' ' we all felt really hot so @entity5 went and brought a fan down from upstairs			2
about two hours later @entity8 and i had another smaller one and @entity5 had a larger one			1
” @entity203 , who had organised the night out , said he went downstairs at 10am the next day and saw ms @entity8 ' flicking her legs and making weird noises and rolling off the sofa '			1
' i told him [ @entity5 ] to get them an ambulance , ' he told the inquest			1
' i said she was a mess			0
' she just looked high and more gone than the others but @entity5 was bog - eyed too and said he was high			1
' a couple of hours later i heard noises coming from @entity5 ’s room - it was all fidgeting and groaning , so i just thought someone was having sex so i did n’t want to go in			1
after a while i heard a big bang			0
' i went in and saw @entity5 on the bed and it was broken and the curtains had come down			2
@entity5 seemed more like @entity8 was earlier			1
i started asking him if he was alright			0
' he was talking normal one second then speaking gibberish the next			0
i did n’t think the worst because i had seen him take drugs before and he had done mad things			0
' then he started saying " get out of my body " and at this point i asked if he needed an ambulance but he said he was alright			0
' he was saying he wanted to get it out of his system			0
i phoned a friend for advice			2
we did n’t phone the ambulance straight away because you do n’t want to get your friend in trouble			2
' he started drinking some orange juice so i thought he was recovering			0
' a friend picked up ms @entity8 at 11am , when she was still suffering the effects of the drug			1
soon afterwards she collapsed and stopped breathing			0
she was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead at 1.30pm			0
police arrived at @entity5 's home at 2pm , but he died in the living room despite paramedics ' efforts			2
coroner @entity125 recorded a verdict of accidental death			2
car welder @entity5 told friends he wanted the drug out of his body before collapsing in his living room she told the families of both victims : ' nothing that happened here was in any way intentional - but the fact is they , and other young people , are taking risks with their lives			1
' there is a culture of it out there and i would say just do n’t do it and do n’t let others do it			0
please learn from this and help others learn from this			0
' i ca n’t imagine the pain of losing a child and i am so sorry			1
' @entity278 said they were waiting for phone records to trace the drug 's origin , which could be used in a possible criminal case			0
det insp @entity283 told the inquest : ' these deaths were extremely tragic			0
young people need to be educated about the dangers of taking drugs and as they do n’t understand what they are taking			0
' it ’s part of the culture now			0
people have got to know the perils of taking drugs they do n’t know about			0
