by @entity0 published : 04:10 est , 19 september 2013 updated : 05:40 est , 19 september 2013 an ivory toothbrush belonging to the last emperor of @entity3 is among 200,000 objects that have been unearthed at an excavation site in @entity6			1
a team of archeologists has been painstakingly scrapping away the soil at the site in the north of the capital , near the former imperial palace , ever since it was discovered by engineers building an extension to the underground rail network			1
the haul , which contains artefacts spanning the 17th to 19th century , also includes minty toothpaste made by a chemist in @entity22 for the @entity23 of @entity24 , @entity25 , a water bottle made for the @entity27 , and vessels still full of unidentified liquids			0
royal teeth : this ivory toothbrush once belonged to @entity32 , the last emperor of @entity3 @entity33 : this white pot is believed to have contained toothpaste for the @entity23 of @entity36 @entity37 : archeologist and team leader @entity38 cleans a partially recovered porcelain plate wealthy owners : silver spoons , coins and even jewellery have all been found in good condition last emperor : @entity32 , the @entity47 @entity3 's last monarch , @entity32 , was born in @entity6 in 1825 , the seventh child of @entity50 he came to the throne at the tender age of just six , when his father suddenly abdicated and left the country for @entity22			1
a slavery abolitionist , @entity32 came to be known simply as the @entity47 during the course of his reign			1
although many @entity59 landowners at the time owned slaves , @entity32 was not one of them , and in 1871 he presided over a bill that ruled all children born to slave women would be free			1
but during the 1880s there was a groundswell of support among civilian republicans to overthrow the monarchy , and in 1889 a coup d'etat was launched			0
it led to tje abdication of @entity32 and his family , who went into exile in @entity22			1
the last emperor of @entity3 died two years later in 1891			0
more than two dozen archeologists and historians have been working at the site since it was first discovered in march			1
the plot was once home to a slaughterhouse , and is also believed to have been used by the @entity27 as a rubbish tip. team leader @entity38 said not only has the find yielded a large quantity of objects , many are in remarkably good condition			1
he told website @entity90 : ' what is the most impressive is the intact state of many objects			2
' in archaeology we usually find very fragmented pieces , but this time we 're finding whole objects			2
' the ivory toothbrush is one of the more coveted items as it is belonged to @entity32 , who ruled over @entity3 between 1831 and 1889			2
chemist : the toothpaste porcelain pots were made by a firm with branches in @entity107 and @entity108 bottles : thousands of glass and ceramic bottles and containers have been recovered from the site intact : while these spittoons may be cracked and broken , many of the items are in excellent condition inscribed : the writing on this glass water bottle offers proof it was used by the royal household painstaking : archeologist @entity122 washes a porcelain plate fragment that was recovered from the site the ivory brush has turned brown with age and its boar bristles have all but disappeared			2
but there is no doubt that it once polished the @entity131 's teeth given its inscription : ' his majesty the emperor of @entity3			0
' a round white porcelain container inscribed with the words ' to the @entity23 of @entity136 ' may have once contained mint - flavoured toothpaste , according to the team			0
the chemist that made it had offices in @entity107 and @entity108			0
dozens of glass and ceramic bottles have been found at the site , along with six sealed bottles that still contain unidentified liquids			0
these are destined for the laboratory , where scientists will try to reveal what they are			0
and dozens of coins and pipes were also found , along with a golden ring and a tie tack			0
the excavation site has now been covered over while work continues to build the metro extension in time for the @entity159 in 2016			1
but once it is finished , the team will be back to continue their work that could shed new light on the life of the nation 's last and arguably best - loved rulers			2
analysis : the bottles of unidentified liquid held by mr @entity38 are destined for the laboratory			0

rare find of 200,000 objects could shed new light on @entity32
many of the artefacts uncovered are in ' remarkably ' intact
the @entity6 site was discovered while building metro extension
the site may have been used as a tip by imperial family
