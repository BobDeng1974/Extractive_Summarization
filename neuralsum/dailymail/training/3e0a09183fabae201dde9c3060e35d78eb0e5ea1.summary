by @entity0 the most senior officer of the @entity2 to survive the ship 's sinking downplayed the cause of the disaster as a ' small low - lying iceberg ' in an insurance claim form which has come up for sale			1
in the unique document , second officer @entity10 wrote that the ship made a ' slight jar ' before starting to go down			1
he also tried to excuse the behaviour of staff who failed to spot the iceberg , denying that they were guilty of ' negligence ' or being insufficiently vigilant			2
@entity10 's insurance claim is believed to have been an attempt to minimise the responsibility of the ship 's owner , @entity24 , in order to secure the full payout of $ 5million ( £ 3million )			1
document : this is the account of the @entity2 's sinking written by second officer @entity10 distortion : @entity10 , pictured , apparently tried to minimise the scale of the iceberg which the ship struck the historic document detailing his account of the disaster is being sold at auction by @entity38 and sons of @entity40 , @entity41 , with a pre-sale estimate of £ 12,000			1
the @entity2 sank on the night of april 14 , 1912 , after it struck an iceberg which was 50 - 100ft high and 200 - 400ft wide , with more than 1,500 people dying in the catastrophe - partly thanks to the lack of sufficient lifeboats			2
the ship was insured by 77 different insurance companies , for a total of $ 5million , meaning that @entity10 had to fill out a loss sheet as soon as he arrived in @entity52			1
together with third officer @entity55 , fourth officer @entity53 and fifth officer @entity54 , he gave an account of the accident			0
in the testimony made to @entity59 , the notary public for @entity52 , on april 19 , @entity10 explained that ' all went well ' until 11.45pm on april 14 when the ship struck an iceberg			1
account : @entity10 wrote that the ship hit a ' small low - lying iceberg ' and made a ' slight jar ' form : the front page of the insurance claim signed by @entity10 and three other officers he stated : ' the captain was on and off the bridge throughout the watch			1
a sharp lookout was kept from the crow 's nest			0
' the ship was on course @entity75 86 degrees west true when the lookouts reported ice dead ahead			0
' the first officer immediately starboarded the helm reversed the engines full speed and closed all watertight doors			0
' the ship swung to port but struck a ' growler ' or small low - lying iceberg with the bluff of her starboard bow , making a comparatively slight jar with a grinding sound			1
' he went to explain that ' all hands were called on deck ' and the lifeboats were filled with women and children			0
signed : the four officers were the most senior staff of the ship to survive the deadly disaster historic : the sinking of the @entity2 was one of the worst maritime disasters in history claims for the @entity2 totalled £ 16million - the equivalent of £ 1.7billion in today 's money			1
the life insurance policy payout to the wife of @entity111 , a prominent businessman from @entity112 , who drowned in the disaster , was the largest of its time at £ 31,000			2
strangely , his wife died on the same day as when the ship went down - 32 years later on april 15 , 1944			2
@entity119 , who survived , claimed £ 3,100 for his @entity121 car that sank with the ship			0
this became the first ever claim for a vehicle damaged in a collision with an iceberg			0
@entity24 paid out around £ 2.5million to @entity2 claimants - £ 2.2million to @entity129 claimants and £ 400,000 to @entity130			2
however , people in the @entity130 originally filed claims totalling £ 10million - so only a fraction of this was eventually paid out			0
he added : ' at 2.20am , april 15 , 1912 , the @entity2 sank , going down bow first in very nearly the same position as when struck			2
' the master , chief , first and sixth officers were lost and also all the engineers and the pursers and their staff as well as the chief and second stewards			0
' part of the small print signed by the four officers states : ' any loss , damage or injury which has arisen in any way or manner is solely owing to the accidents and difficulties herein set forth and declared and not to any negligence , want of skill , vigilance or exertion on the part of the deponents or any of the officers or men of the said vessel			0
' @entity24 was able to receive a payment of $ 4.25million - the full value of $ 5million , minus a deductible of $ 750,000			1
one of the main insurance companies that covered the @entity2 was @entity169 of @entity52 , which folded three years ago after failing to recover from claims related to the september 11 terror attacks			2
@entity10 's insurance claim was one of a haul of historic documents contained in the firm 's archives , and was bought by an anonymous dealer who is now selling it in @entity40 on april 26			1
@entity181 , of @entity38 and sons , said : ' if you have a car accident we have to fill out an insurance claim form and this form follows the same principle			1
' this is the account from the four surviving officers , but intriguingly they appear to underplay the severity of the collision and the size of the iceberg as if to minimise the encounter			0
' this could be to try and downplay the negligence potentially - the smaller the iceberg the harder it is to see			0
' there is nothing else like this document out there and is another reason why there is this endless fascination with the @entity2 story and new information about it emerge so many years later			0

second officer @entity10 had to file an insurance claim in @entity52
said the giant ship hit a ' small low - lying iceberg ' and made a ' slight jar '
added that it was not the fault of the ship 's staff that they did *n't* see *obstacle*
the @entity2 was insured for $ 5million with 77 different insurers
claim form is coming up for auction with estimated price of £ 12,000
