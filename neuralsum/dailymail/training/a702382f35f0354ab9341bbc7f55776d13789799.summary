he added it forms part of the government 's commitment to invest more than £ 160billion in equipment and equipment support over the next decade			0
he said : ' as a result , our military will have some of the most impressive and technologically - advanced capabilities in the world , from the aircraft carriers and the @entity75 fighter jets to the type 45 destroyers , @entity78 armoured vehicles , the @entity79 and the @entity81 submarines			0
' mr @entity0 , pictured at the @entity83 shipyard in @entity39 today , said : ' investing in these warships will ensure we continue to keep our country safe , at home and abroad ' @entity16 chief executive @entity87 said : ' we have a long and proud heritage of delivering complex warships in the @entity45 and today 's announcement is a significant endorsement of the government 's commitment to sustain this important national capability			1
' we are committed to working with the government , the @entity95 and our partners in the maritime supply chain to ensure the @entity6 has the capability it needs to protect national interests , while ensuring the best value for money for @entity45 taxpayers			1
' through the type 26 programme , we are transforming the way we design and manufacture naval ships with innovative new technologies , leading - edge processes and modern infrastructure			0
' new ways of working ensure we can continue to deliver the highest quality equipment at the lowest possible cost and compete effectively for future @entity45 and international orders			1

he said : ' this announcement is very good news in that it secures the future of the @entity135 shipyards and the skilled workforce and will enable the company to provide a substantial number of much - needed apprenticeships			0
' the uncertain international climate calls into question the @entity143 plans for further cuts in defence spending in the next parliament			0
' these will impact on the capacity of the @entity149 , the @entity6 and the @entity150 at a time when the @entity45 needs to be able to deal with all threats to national security			0
the skilled shipyard and defence workforce are as much on the front line as the forces in uniform			0
' during the election campaign the electorate need to question @entity143 spending plans where the combined annual budget of non-protected departments would have to come down by a third in real terms			0
' a cut of one third in defence spending is simply not on and these plans must be changed			0
' prime minister @entity0 ( centre ) during a visit to @entity83 shipyard in @entity39 , @entity2 today 's announcement marked the culmination of an argument that raged during the independence referendum over the future of shipbuilding in @entity2			1
the @entity7 shipyards had been earmarked for the lucrative contract to build type 26 frigates , but the decision would be confirmed after the vote in september			0
former first minister @entity183 reassured @entity185 voters that shipbuilding would continue on the @entity7 if @entity2 became independent			2
but the no campaign - supported by the @entity45 government , @entity95 , @entity6 and @entity16 ( who all said that it would not and could not ) - argued the contract would be lost if @entity2 left the @entity45			2
asked to guarantee the long - term future of shipbuilding , mr @entity183 told the @entity191 : ' the @entity6 will continue to order ships from @entity2 yards , based on that these are the best places to produce these vessels			2
' but his remarks in april last year coincided with a speech by then @entity45 defence secretary @entity197 in @entity39 - who warned that thousands of jobs would be at risk if @entity2 became independent			0
@entity87 , chief executive of @entity16 , also indicated , in a letter submitted to the chairman of the @entity204 @entity203 , that shipyards on the @entity7 would likely have to close if @entity2 voted for independence			2
mr @entity203 agreed , along with the shipbuilding industry and the @entity95 , that ' the only guarantee for the future of shipbuilding on the @entity7 is for @entity2 to remain part of the @entity45			0
' this is because companies based in an independent @entity2 state would no longer be eligible for contracts that the @entity45 chose to place or compete domestically for national security reasons due to @entity217 of the treaty on the functioning of the @entity220			0
the @entity45 has not had a complex warship built outside of the country since the @entity223			1
but mr @entity183 and then deputy first minister @entity224 drew criticism from the industry and trade unions for continuing to suggest @entity45 's new warships would be built in @entity2 if the nationalist campaign was successful as @entity95 sources insisted it would not happen			1
the no campaign argued the lucrative shipbuilding contract would be lost if @entity2 left the @entity45 , but former first minister @entity183 ( right ) reassured @entity185 voters that shipbuilding would continue on the @entity7 @entity235 , @entity236 staff convener at @entity16 , said unions knew that @entity45 defence contracts would not be awarded to a foreign country			1
@entity2 secretary @entity240 also argued @entity2 would find it ' difficult ' to win @entity45 government shipbuilding contracts if the country votes for independence			0
the @entity245 accused him of trying to blackmail @entity2 into voting no. nationalists claimed the @entity7 was the only place left to build warships following @entity16 's decision to end shipbuilding in @entity252			1
@entity224 dismissed suggestions that a @entity185 vote would put future warship orders in doubt , claiming that the @entity7 would be the ' best and only place ' to build the ships			0
in november 2013 , she said : ' the current @entity45 government has just agreed with @entity16 that @entity252 will cease building ships in 2014 , and that @entity39 is ' the most effective location for the manufacture of the future type 26 ships '			2
that will remain true , whether there is a ' yes ' next year or not			0
