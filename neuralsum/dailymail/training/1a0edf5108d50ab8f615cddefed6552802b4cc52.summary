@entity0 has said @entity1 has no authority or moral responsibility for what happens in @entity5 post- 1997 , in the latest shot fired in a diplomatic row between the nations that has escalated since the weekend			1
the war of words kicked off on sunday when a group of @entity1 mps , who were set to visit @entity5 on a research mission regarding the progress towards democracy later this month , were refused entry			1
prime minister @entity17 sharply criticised that decision , saying it heightened concerns about the situation in the former @entity1 colony			1
long fight : @entity1 mps had applied for visas to @entity5 to investigate regarding the progress towards democracy which has seen ' occupy ' protests in the city for two months ' his view is that the decision with regard to the foreign affairs committee is a mistaken one , ' @entity17 's spokesperson said			1
' it 's counter productive because it only serves to amplify concerns about the situation in @entity5 , rather than diminishing concerns			1
' the @entity1 parliament held a three - hour emergency debate over the ban on tuesday , with members warning it would damage relations between @entity43 and @entity44			2
today , @entity0 responded to the critique from @entity17 and @entity46 , saying that @entity1 has no responsibility for @entity5 after returning the city to @entity0 rule			1
the ' one country , two systems ' formula that was agreed in 1997 , allowed @entity5 to keep wide - ranging freedoms and autonomy			2
marking territory : @entity44 said today that @entity1 has ' no sovereignty , no authority and no right to oversight ' in @entity5 post- 1997 new move : a group of @entity63 demonstrators hold signs outside the @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity5 on wednesday giving in : @entity67 - ting , @entity69 - man and @entity70 , the three co-founders of @entity63 movement , surrender themselves in to the police today ' @entity1 has no sovereignty over a @entity5 that has returned to @entity0 , no authority and no right to oversight			1
there is no such thing as a moral responsibility , ' @entity79 spokesperson @entity78 said today			0
' the real aim of a small minority of @entity1 people trying to use so - called moral responsibility to obscure the facts is to interfere in @entity0 's internal affairs			2
' such an attempt can not succeed , and is something @entity0 certainly can not accept			0
' moves by @entity44 to control nominations for a 2017 vote for @entity5 's leader have prompted the weeks of protests			2
today , after two months of civil action in central @entity5 , the three founders of the @entity63 movement handed themselves over to police			0
@entity67 , @entity69 - man and @entity101 surrendered this morning while dozens of supporters , many carrying the yellow umbrellas that have become a symbol of the movement , gathered outside the police station in central @entity5			0
however , despite admitting to the crime of ' participating in unauthorised assembly ' , the trio were not arrested and soon emerged from the police station to cheers from protesters			0
' we have not been arrested so we are allowed to leave with no restriction on our liberty , ' @entity67 said			0
he added there were ' political considerations ' behind their swift release to avoid crowds flocking to the protest zones , but said it was inevitable they would eventually be arrested			0
' i do n't think the matter will be resolved on this occasion , later we may be arrested , even prosecuted for more serious offences , ' @entity67 added .			0
