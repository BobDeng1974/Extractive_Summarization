by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 : 18:26 est , 19 december 2013 @entity3 : 18:30 est , 19 december 2013 it only took a few hours for a bipartisan congressional push against @entity7 's nuclear ambitions to become @entity9 roadkill on thursday , as the @entity10 insisted that president @entity11 will veto any effort to introduce new sanctions on the @entity15 republic while the @entity16 works its diplomatic levers			1
a group of 13 democrats and 13 republicans in the @entity21 introduced a bill that would levy tough new penalties on @entity7 if it fails to prove by may that it has terminated its nuclear weapons program			1
but in his afternoon press briefing , @entity10 press secretary @entity26 said @entity11 would have no patience with congressional efforts to put pressure on @entity7 president @entity31 during a period of negotiation designed to bring his country 's nuclear program out in the open			1
' we do n't think this action is necessary , ' @entity26 told reporters			0
' we donâ € ™ t think it will be enacted			0
if it were enacted , the president would veto it			0
the @entity21 bill would ' greatly increase the chances that the @entity1 would have to take military action ' against @entity7 , he claimed			2
' it would potentially divide the international community and obviously would suggest bad faith on the part of the @entity1			0
' but that view does n't square with more than one - quarter of the @entity21			0
foreign relations chairman @entity86 , a @entity88 @entity87 , and @entity89 , an @entity91 @entity90 , introduced the @entity92 of 2013 earlier in the day , along with 24 other co-sponsors			0
' current sanctions brought @entity7 to the negotiating table , ' @entity86 said thursday , ' and a credible threat of future sanctions will require @entity7 to cooperate and act in good faith			0
' ' the burden rests with @entity7 to negotiate in good faith and verifiably terminate its nuclear weapons program , ' he said			0
@entity89 called the legislation ' a responsible , bipartisan bill to protect the @entity1 people from @entity7 deception			2
' ' the @entity1 people rightfully distrust @entity7 's true intentions , ' he added , ' and they deserve an insurance policy to defend against @entity7 deception			2
' @entity111 , jr. : sen. @entity86 is getting a reputation for bucking his own party , most recently with a bill designed to force president @entity11 's hand during tense negotiations with @entity7 it 's unclear whether majority leader @entity119 will advance the bill to the @entity21 floor for a vote , even if it gains momentum and a host of new co-sponsors			1
believable ? @entity31 has publicly pledged to open up his uranium enrichment sites to inspectors and slow production , while privately telling his countrymen that it will be business as usual in @entity7 's nuclear program but with more than a dozen @entity133 in direct conflict with the @entity10 's policy on @entity7 , the stage has been set for a @entity137 conflict that the @entity7 will likely watch unfold on @entity138			1
one aide to a senator who co-sponsored the bill told @entity142 that the @entity144 's concerns about new hostilities between @entity7 and the west is ' a false choice			0
' ' the supporters of the bill believe it makes war less likely , ' the staffer said : ' sanctions brought us this far , and the threat of additional sanctions can help us force @entity7 to get rid of their nuclear weapons in the negotiations			2
' the @entity21 bill would forbid the @entity11 administration from waiving any congressionally approved sanctions unless the @entity1 and its allies have ' reached a final and verifiable agreement or arrangement with @entity7 that will ... dismantle @entity7 's illicit nuclear infrastructure , including enrichment and reprocessing capabilities and facilities			1
' @entity48 could also block sanctions waivers , according to an analysis by @entity172 , ' by passing a " joint resolution of disapproval " against a final deal			0
' the legislation also features a a non-binding promise that if @entity77 were to take ' military action in legitimate self - defense against @entity7 's nuclear weapons program , ' the @entity1 ' should stand with @entity77 and provide ... diplomatic , military , and economic support to the @entity183 in its defense of its territory , people , and existence			1
' hot seat : secretary of state @entity189 has to continue overseeing negotiations while the @entity21 committee he once chaired wrangles internally over whether to add more fuel to his fire the @entity10 's veto threat is already hitting home with @entity77 's supporters in @entity137			1
the @entity54 quickly labeled the @entity21 effort ' carefully considered legislation intended to prevent a nuclear @entity7			1
' ' the @entity11 administration immediately threatened to veto the legislation , ' the group said in a statement , ' and falsely accuses its sponsors of engaging in a rush to war			0
in fact the @entity10 has responded in far harsher terms to these members of @entity48 than it has to an @entity7 regime which continues to enrich uranium , prevent monitoring of its nuclear program , and still refuses to implement the @entity216 agreement negotiated last month			1
' @entity7 foreign minister @entity217 told @entity218 this month that new sanctions , including penalties slated to take effect after november 's six - month interim agreement expires , would eliminate the chance for a more comprehensive nuclear bargain .			2

13 @entity133 and 13 from the @entity90 side proposed tough new sanctions on @entity7 if it does n't follow through on nuclear promises
the @entity10 quickly *announced* that president @entity11 would veto any effort that would add new pressure to an already - tense negotiation
@entity1 - @entity77 lobby came out *blasting* , claiming @entity11 has been tougher on senators from his own party than he has been on @entity7 *extremists*
