two female @entity1 councillors have embarked on an unusual quest to clamp down on illegal prostitution - by dressing up in miniskirts and confronting kerb - crawlers with a hidden camera			1
the stunt had been initiated by mayor @entity8 , who would stay in the background while the two fake prostitutes waited by the road , and approach the men when they stopped			1
mr @entity8 and councillors @entity13 and @entity15 staged the set - up after growing tired of the damaging effect prostitution had on their town near @entity20 in @entity21			2
it is a small community on the @entity43 coast with a population of around 23,000 , and mr @entity8 has made is his mission to ' clean the streets '			0
mr @entity8 said the ' fake prostitute ' campaign was initiated to hammer home this message to the local male population			0
the stunt saw ms @entity13 and ms @entity15 dress in miniskirts with revealing tops and high heels , and stand by a busy road popular with local prostitutes			1
but when punters would stop for the fake prostitutes , they were confronted by the mayor and a cameraman , leaping out from behind parked cars			1
sneaky : as one punter stops to ask one of the fake prostitutes for her services , mayor @entity8 appears to confront him mistake : one driver who had stopped to speak to the women drives off after being confronted mr @entity8 said he wanted to engage the kerb - crawlers in dialogue over what they were doing			1
he said : ' i had leaflets just warning them of their civic responsibilities and exactly why prostitution is illegal , but i have to admit i did n't give many out			0
' when they saw me coming with the tv cameras , most people drove off at high speed			0
' the footage of the stunt has been handed over to local police in @entity34 , who prosecuted the men caught on camera			0
in all cases , the men readily paid the fine rather than risk the embarrassment of going to court			0
mr @entity8 said he wanted to send out a reminder to @entity1 who use the services of prostitutes , as well as the prostitutes themselves , that they will face legal consequences			2
