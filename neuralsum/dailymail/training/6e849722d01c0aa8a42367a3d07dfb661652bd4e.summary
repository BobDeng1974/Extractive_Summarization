by @entity0 published : 05:01 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 08:04 est , 13 february 2013 @entity1 , from @entity2 , is currently being treated for two forms of cancer when @entity1 was diagnosed with leukaemia , his parents thought things could n't get any worse			1
but two years into his cancer battle , doctors discovered the brave boy had developed another deadly form of the disease - and he was the only person in the world to suffer from both conditions			1
the 13 - year - old 's mother @entity15 , 32 , said : ' my son is fighting two cancers - leukaemia and @entity20			1
' he is truly just one in seven billion all over the world			2
' it has been a rollercoaster ride for the family from @entity2 , @entity23			2
the youngster was first diagnosed with leukaemia in july 2010 after his glands swelled and he lost his appetite			1
then three months into his treatment , he suffered appendicitis			0
he was given just a 20 per cent chance of recovery from the operation because he had so few white blood cells and his platelets were so low			0
thankfully , surgery was a success and by may 2011 he was in remission			0
he returned to school that september and his parents started to hope that they were out of the woods			0
by august 2012 , @entity1 faced just one more year of treatment , when he started complaining about pain in his tonsils			1
he was seen by a specialist who decided to remove them straight away			0
' the @entity47 surgeon told me that @entity1 ’s tonsils were very large , very hard , almost rock - like and extremely difficult the remove			1
he was so shocked by the condition of his tonsils that he immediately sent them away for analysis , ' mrs @entity51 wrote on her blog			0
tests revealed @entity1 not only had leukaemia , he had now also developed a type of cancer called @entity20			1
the cancer is so rare that there are thought to be just four other sufferers worldwide			0
sarcomas are a deadly group of cancers which strike the connective tissues , including fat , muscle , cartilage and bone			2
the world 's top oncology consultants have now got together to decide on the best course of treatment for @entity1 as they bid to tackle a health case which is unique and unprecedented			1
as a result , @entity1 will head to @entity77 for a vital life - saving bone marrow transplant			1
while preparing for the make - or - break journey , @entity15 and her husband @entity81 , 33 , praised their son 's incredible bravery and inner strength as he faces months away from home			0
our brave boy : @entity81 and @entity15 are taking @entity1 to @entity77 for a vital life - saving bone marrow transplant @entity1 will be totally isolated from the outside world for most of the time as he is stripped of his immune system and surgeons blast him with as much radiotherapy as his young body can take			1
' we are prepared to stay at least three months in @entity97 with @entity1 , ' said mrs @entity51 , who also has a younger son , @entity98 , eight			1
' but that is if it is straightforward and nothing is ever straightforward with @entity1			1
' the sarcoma cancer is so rare that they have never even treated it before but they have decided this is the best course of treatment			0
' it is called an @entity110 protocol , which involves 12 days of conditioning , total body radiotherapy and targeted radiotherapy to his throat - which is where they found the tumours originally			2
' @entity1 is set to have his crucial bone marrow transplant on march 1 and he will then be put in total isolation for between three and seven months			1
all being well , the teenager will then be transferred to @entity122 , @entity123 , for at least a further month of intensive treatment and recovery care			0
the pupil will then need to have all his childhood jabs again as he confronts his biggest challenge to date			0
courage : @entity1 enjoys a special day out with the @entity130 @entity1 with his mother @entity15			1
he is top of his class at school and wants to be a doctor his father said : ' he does n't want to go because he has just been in hospital for three months having intensive chemotherapy and only been home for two weeks			0
' he will have to go back into that routine again but he is so positive at the same time and wants to get it over with , to get fixed and get back to school			0
' @entity1 is so bright - he 's top of the class in everything he does and he wants to be a doctor			1
' friends and family have rallied around to help pay for travel costs and allow @entity1 's parents to take time off work to care for him			2
the family 's foundation , @entity153 , has now raised more than £ 7,000			0
mr and mrs @entity51 hope to register it as a charity when @entity1 is well again to help other children who have cancer relapses			2
mr @entity1 said : ' @entity1 is 100 per cent certain that he will come through this very tough time			2
' but whatever happens he will have to have blood tests for the rest of his life and there are other risks such as cataracts and infertility			0
' but the way @entity1 deals with his own mortality is incredible and it helps everyone else deal with it , too			2
' he believes that once this year is over he has the rest of his life to do what he wants and we are all totally behind him			0

@entity1 was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was 10
he was then diagnosed with @entity20 when he was 12
doctors say he is only person in the world to be fighting both conditions
