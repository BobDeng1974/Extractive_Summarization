it was staggering that @entity1 did not turn to @entity2 as @entity3 were trailing 2 - 1 against @entity4 in the @entity6 quarter - final			1
the poor lad must be thinking : what am i doing here ? i know he is not the player @entity3 thought they were getting , but is nâ€™t it down to the manager to get the best out of him ? @entity2 ( second right ) was an unused substitute during @entity3 's defeat to @entity4 @entity17 ( right ) was brought on at half - time but @entity19 forward @entity2 was left unused goalscorers change games but instead they chased the match with @entity23 and @entity17 , two sitting midfielders , on the pitch			0
surely it would have been better to show greater intent by throwing on @entity2 ? @entity3 never threatened @entity4 once @entity28 put them ahead and it is @entity30 's side who have progressed to the semi-final at @entity33 .			0

@entity2 did not leave the bench as @entity4 beat @entity3
@entity1 brought on @entity17 , @entity37 and @entity38
@entity28 , a former @entity3 *striker* , scored @entity4 's winning goal
