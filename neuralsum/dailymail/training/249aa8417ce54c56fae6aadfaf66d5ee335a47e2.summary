right , he photographs himself holding a kaleidoscope two other images show him washing his hair in the shower ( left ) and then later brushing it the 35 - year - old @entity36 - based artist used a small digital camera to record all objects he came into contact with in what he calls a ' dna code for other humans to interpret '			1
he explained : ' the panels show the objects i have used with my right hand since the 24th of september 2003			2
' each panel represents a month , each line a day , and each individual photograph an object			0
' @entity51 of these objects is like the letter of an alphabet representing my activities as a kind of dna code for other humans to interpret			0
' he estimated he touches about 75 objects per day , and intends to continue the project until his retirement in 2040 , @entity60 reported			2
@entity7 previously attempted to use a finger - mounted camera system where the camera sat permanently attached to his hand ( pictured ) mr @entity7 estimates he touches 75 objects a day with his right hand			1
here he is pictured left and right drinking thousands of photographs simply document food or the utensils he uses to eat mr @entity7 's exhibition is composed of many panels displaying the photograph in strands which he calls a type of ' dna ' it was when he started studying in @entity80 and became ' fascinated ' by all that he was learning - such as making his own food , his laundry and the other jobs his mother once took care of - that the project began			1
he said : ' it was about at this time that i tried to figure out a way to record my life without all the post editing and technological frustrations			0
‘ a day later i was photographing every object my right hand uses in order to keep track of my activities			0
‘ i then thought of the objects i was using as the letters of an alphabet which could , in the long run , make up a sort of dna code of my life			0
i was 24 then and still eager to discover new exciting things in life			0
’ he has become so accustomed to the project that his left hand now almost naturally photographs his right hand without him even thinking about it , and he abides by the rule that every object the dominant hand uses is photographed once while being used			0
his exhibition is currently on display at the @entity117 in @entity118			2
