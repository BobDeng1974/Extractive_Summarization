it looks like it might soon be moving day for reality star @entity2 and his brood of eight — downsizing from his lavish 30,000 square foot @entity6 , @entity8 home to a two - bedroom condo in @entity10			1
according to court documents obtained by @entity13 , @entity2 , 45 , the sharp - tongued family patriarch of @entity11 , could soon lose the family ’s mansion to the bank if it ’s not sold first			1
a new court order entitles the bank holding the million dollar mortgage on the two - acre estate to foreclose on the property			1
until now , @entity2 had been shielded from foreclosure after he filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012			2
but a buyer may save the day			0
according to @entity37 , a broker with @entity38 , the home , which went on the market in march for $ 2.4 million , is now under contract for an undisclosed sum			1
but where does that leave @entity2 , who owes close to a million dollars on the house ? his only property that is not on the line is a two - bedroom condo in @entity10 ! the fifth floor unit , located at 620 @entity50 in @entity10 , is completely paid off			1
it is a 1,750 square foot , two - bedroom , two - bathroom , condominium unit worth $ 300,000			1
a 30,000 square foot mansion with it 's own theatre , grotto , elevator and nine fireplaces ... to this ... a 1,750 square foot two - bedroom condominium unit on the fifth floor in @entity10 the family is also in danger of losing two more of their four properties			1
in addition to the family home , @entity2 is also facing foreclosure on the house occupied by his mother , @entity70			2
he defaulted on a $ 33,000 loan and she and @entity2 ’s oldest son @entity73 , who had been staying with his grandmother , are about to be forced out			0
@entity70 ’s $ 500,000 house , located in @entity76 , @entity8 , has four bedrooms and four bathrooms and is 3,000 square feet			0
the third possible casualty of @entity2 ’s bankruptcy is his four bedroom , four bathroom , 4,324 square foot lakefront vacation retreat located in @entity84 , @entity85 , 37 miles from @entity86			2
the house was purchased for $ 1.425 million , however with back payments and penalties the amount has swollen to over $ 1.688 million			0
court order : the mansion , previously protected under the bankruptcy law , is now subject to foreclosure , unless someone buys the property first when @entity2 filed for bankruptcy he listed more than $ 4.2 million in assets but claimed his debts were amazingly , over $ 49 million ! according to @entity101 ’s financial empire literally collapsed overnight after @entity2 and @entity102 lost a lucrative contract with @entity104 , where most of their fortune had been built refurbishing foreclosure properties and selling them for a fat commission			1
@entity2 allegedly owned a company called executive @entity109 and made $ 8 million in 2004 , which he sold that same year			2
in 2008 he launched @entity111 , where the bankruptcy trustee claims @entity2 was withdrawing over $ 500,000 per month in income from the business			0
the trustee went on to exclaim @entity2 and @entity102 own — or owned — homes in resorts in @entity118 and @entity119 as well as the large estate in @entity10			0
in addition , the trustee explained @entity2 also owned a condominium in @entity124 and leases a substantial residence in @entity126 , @entity8			0
however , according to a recent search of real estate documents @entity2 , only owns the four properties now and his wife , @entity102 , a former beauty queen who has her own fortune , is not listed as a co-owner on any of them			2
in the closet : @entity2 's notoriously huge walk - in closet is probably bigger than one of the bedrooms in the condo @entity2 also reportedly owes the @entity139 more than $ 500,000 and he even borrowed $ 4.4 million from his wife to invest in the business			1
@entity2 and his wife , @entity102 , who have five children and two grandchildren , proudly boasted on the march 11 , 2014 premiere of the show on @entity147 that they live in a gated community with many celebrities , including the “ @entity151 ” judge , @entity150			2
he went on to brag that his family spends at least $ 300,000 a year on shopping sprees			1
the sprawling 30,000 - square - foot mansion includes a gourmet indoor kitchen as well as an outdoor one , a living room that is so large it ’s takes up an entire floor , a huge spa bathroom next to the master suite , nine fireplaces , a theater , grotto , wine cellar , elevator , saltwater pool and , of course , his infamous walk - in closet full of his designer clothes that he has separated by the different seasons			0
@entity2 may not be able to save all or any of the three properties but he has already started to bounce back with his reality show and as a result of record ratings the @entity147 has already renewed the show for a second season			0
' @entity177 should be something you should strive to be			0
' @entity2 explained on the show , ' i expect a certain standard , i want us to live a certain way			0

court documents obtained by @entity13 reveal the bank has been granted *permission* to repossess the house where the @entity2 knows best star lives with wife , five children and two *grandkids*
the only property @entity2 owns *outright* is a two - bedroom , two - bathroom condo in @entity10
@entity2 filed for bankruptcy in 2012 but the house will no *longer* be protected from the law
the house was put on the market for $ 2.4 million in march
@entity2 bragged that the family spends upwards of $ 300,000 a year on shopping sprees but court records shows he 's $ 49 million in debt
