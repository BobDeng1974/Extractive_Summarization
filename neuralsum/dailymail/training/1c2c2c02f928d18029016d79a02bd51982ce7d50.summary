by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 19:38 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 19:38 est , 7 november 2013 householders face being forced to recycle more after the government admitted it is falling behind @entity5 targets			0
despite years of efforts by families to meet the demands of fortnightly collections , nine - bin collections , kitchen slop buckets and other compulsory recycling schemes , recycling rates remain too low to comply with @entity15 rules			1
recycling figures flatlined last year , according to figures released by the @entity18 yesterday			1
grinding to a halt : recycling figures have flatlined in the last year meaning ministers are now under pressure to do more to compel householders to do more they suggest the great recycling revolution - imposed on a majority of homes in the country when their traditional weekly rubbish collections were withdrawn - has reached its limits and families are unwilling to do more to help			1
the failure means ministers are now under pressure to do more to compel householders to put out more of their refuse in a way that can be easily recycled			0
among methods that have been under consideration are compulsory systems involving a string of separate recycling bins for every home , or monthly bin collections which mean that rubbish not separated for recycling is collected by binmen only once every four weeks			1
the new figures from @entity51 ’s @entity50 said that the amount of household waste recycled in the year to the end of march was 43.2 per cent , up just 0.2 per cent on the previous year ’s level			1
a report from @entity50 said there was ‘ much variation across local authorities ’			0
it added : ‘ the rate of increase in the last year is insufficient to meet the 50 per cent @entity15 target by 2020			1
not enough : @entity51 's @entity50 says recyling of household waste went up just 0.2 per cent ‘ the household recycling rate was increasing rapidly until recent years			1
the rapid rise occurred while local authorities were introducing and expanding their recycling collection schemes			1
’ according to the report , only just over one in five of the 352 local councils that collect household rubbish succeeded in reaching the 50 per cent recycling target			1
among setbacks were a drop of 10 per cent in the amount of glass and cans collected from homes in recycling bins , and a drop of six per cent in the amount of paper and card separated from other rubbish			1
‘ this may be due to various factors including more use of co-mingled collections or change in consumer behaviour to minimise waste , ’ the report said			0
it added that there was a low collection rate for green waste in the first three months of this year ‘ resulting from the freezing temperature and bad weather conditions			2
’ an @entity18 spokesman said that ministers are determined to hit the @entity15 recycling target			1
‘ we are working with local authorities and communities to meet our 50 per cent target by 2020 , ’ she said			0
‘ local authorities can continue to collect mixed waste as long as the quality of recycling is high enough			2
it is up to local authorities to decide what works best in their local area within the law			0
’ ministers have warned councils that to meet the terms of @entity15 recycling law they must from 2015 do their best to collect household waste paper , plastic , metal and glass separately			2
the instructions raise the prospect of every house being given five bins or their rubbish , four for separate recycling materials and one for general waste			2
however @entity129 regulations on how councils will be expected to put the rules into effect have yet to be published			0
more than half the homes in the country have fortnightly collections , kitchen slopbuckets or other compulsory recycling systems			2
however material that is set out for recycling is often too impure to be recycled , and is incinerated , landfilled or sent abroad for recycling in @entity140 countries			2
@entity141 of the @entity142 said she feared ministers may now revive the ‘ pay - as - you - throw ’ idea , which would mean families would have to pay to get their rubbish collected			2
@entity149 ’s government adopted the idea but dropped it when it proved unpopular			0
mrs @entity141 said : ‘ i am not at all surprised at the new figures			0
they have reached the recycling limit			1
‘ they are not getting the quality of recyclate they need			0
sometimes councils are not entirely honest about the amount of material that goes for recycling			0
‘ the worry is that they will bring out the stick to persuade people to recycle			0
i am worried they will revive pay - as - you - throw			0

recycling figures flatlined last year , according to figures released by the @entity18 yesterday
new figures suggest that the great recycling revolution has reached its limit and families are unwilling to make further changes
