he is a proven scorer ; he 's served his time and the boy wants to play football			2
' if there is a chance he might come here , i do n't see any reason why he should n't			2
' he has made a mistake and maybe he has n't apologised in the right way - and i know he has an appeal case pending - but if he gets on the park , he would go a long way to getting us out of trouble			0
