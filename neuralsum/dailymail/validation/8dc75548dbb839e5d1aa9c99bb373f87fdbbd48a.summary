@entity0 must reinvent himself in order to challenge @entity2 for this year 's @entity4 championship , according to @entity5			1
@entity0 lost out to @entity2 at last season 's title decider in @entity8 , with the @entity9 storming to the chequered flag as his @entity12 team - mate encountered technical gremlins			1
it marked @entity2 's 11th victory of the campaign , six more than @entity0			1
the @entity12 pair are set to go toe - to - toe for this year 's championship once more , with the @entity20 - based outfit appearing to boast the strongest package ahead of sunday 's curtain raiser in @entity23			2
@entity0 needs a reinvention if he is to challenge @entity12 team - mate @entity2 , says @entity5 @entity2 roared to championship victory in 2014 with 11 race victories to his rival team - mate 's six @entity2 ( left ) and @entity0 come together following their final race of a tumultuous season last year @entity0 has a more subtle skill set than his formidable team - mate @entity2 , says @entity5 and @entity5 , the 1996 world champion , believes @entity0 has to improve on his displays of last season to stand any chance of stopping @entity2 from claiming back - to - back titles			1
' @entity0 has talents that are slightly more subtle and less obvious than @entity2 , but i think he is going to have to invent a new @entity0 to counter his team - mate , ' said @entity5			1
' if you look at the strike - rate of @entity2 's wins in comparison to @entity0 , that was pretty formidable really			1
does it change that much and can it change that much over the winter ? ' it can , but politically now @entity0 had an opportunity last year to establish himself as the guy that the team wants to invest in , but @entity2 really captured that with the biggest prize going			1
' the championship was delivered by @entity2 , so he is clearly someone , if @entity12 have to hedge one way or the other , then they will go for @entity2			0
' @entity2 will begin the new campaign as the favourite to claim his third championship			2
but does @entity5 believe there is any danger that the @entity9 , whose celebrity status outside @entity4 continues to grow following a number of showbiz appearances during the off season , will take his eye off the ball ? ' you never know with @entity2 , ' he admitted			2
' he keeps us guessing and it would be easy to take some of the signals he puts out as being slightly distracted by other things			0
@entity2 will begin the new @entity4 campaign as the favourite to claim his third championship star power : some read @entity2 's glitzy lifestyle - here he ( second left ) poses during @entity77 with celebrities ( from left ) @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 - as a distraction ' but he knows what he is doing when he gets in the car and why he is there			2
he has got so much confidence in his own ability			0
' i ca n't see him getting propely distracted			0
he wanted to do this all of his life and i think now he has got the ball rolling he wants to win			0
he can see the prizes , he collects his trophies and is very proud of his success and he still talks as if he is stunned by his own success			0
he will be very difficult to beat this year			0
' @entity97 is the only place fans can watch all 20 @entity99 weekends live across tv , @entity101 and @entity102			0

@entity2 won 11 races in 2014 ahead of @entity0 's six
former world champion @entity5 said @entity2 remains formidable
the 1996 title winner said @entity0 needs to change to beat the @entity108
@entity2 goes into the season opener in @entity111 as favourite
