it 's far from the glamour tie @entity3 fans would have dreamed of upon the club 's return to @entity7 football as @entity9 ' side take on @entity11 minnows @entity10 on tuesday night			1
the @entity11 champions earned their place in this season 's top @entity15 competition thanks to a dramatic @entity7 play - off win against @entity18 in august			1
here , @entity19 tells you all you need to know about the 13 - year - old club about to make their @entity7 debut			1
@entity23 ( above ) celebrates his first penalty save against @entity18 in august the @entity26 defender stepped in to help @entity10 qualify for the @entity7 group stages who are they ? their name is @entity10 , to be precise , and they will be just the second @entity11 team to make an appearance in @entity34 's elite competition - the other being @entity35 in the 2006 - 07 season , and they did n't gain a single point			1
that means , @entity10 , which translates to ' @entity38 ' , only need to record one draw against @entity3 , @entity41 or @entity42 to better their compatriots			2
founded in 2001 , the @entity45 club are just 13 years old			0
to put that in even starker context ahead of tuesday , @entity46 had already been playing in @entity3 's first team for three years			1
their ground in @entity45 only holds 8,000 people and they will have to play their @entity7 matches in the capital @entity55			0
founded in 2001 , @entity10 will make their @entity7 debut against @entity3 on tuesday some teams have a bloke in a costume as their mascot , @entity10 , known as @entity61 , have the real deal			1
after beating @entity64 in @entity65 in february , the @entity63 were so impressed they gave their opponents a live eagle			0
fans named it @entity70 , but they may have missed a sponsorship opportunity — one of the other names suggested was @entity74			0
how did they get to the @entity7 group stage ? promoted to the @entity76 in 2011 , @entity10 have managed to make history by winning three successive titles , largely thanks to the investments of businessman @entity80			2
@entity10 ' summer campaign to claim a place in this season 's @entity7 group stages caught the neutrals ' eye after a dramatic penalty shootout win against @entity18 in august			1
as the tie was forced into extra-time , @entity26 defender @entity23 came to his side 's rescue following the 119th minute dismissal of goalkeeper @entity93			0
@entity23 , forced to wear the shirt of substitute keeper @entity95 , was the hero of the night , scoring the first penalty for his side before making brilliant diving saves to deny @entity99 and @entity100 as @entity10 won the shootout 6 - 5 to spark wild scenes			2
the club ’s ground seats only 6,000 people and does not meet @entity34 requirements , so their home games will be played 200 miles away in @entity55			0
@entity80 has plans to build a new stadium for the club and one of the stands will be named after @entity23			0
@entity114 playmaker @entity113 ( above ) will be @entity3 's biggest threat at @entity116 @entity11 league : 3x winners 2011 – 12 , 2012 – 13 , 2013 – 14 @entity119 : 2x @entity120 2011 - 12 , 2013 – 14 @entity121 2012 , 2014 one to watch @entity114 forward @entity113 has the creativity to cause @entity3 problems if he 's given too much time on the ball			1
and with @entity9 claiming ' we have to defend better , ' following @entity3 's 1 - 0 @entity128 defeat against @entity129 on saturday , @entity113 will be hoping to find the gaps between @entity3 's midfield and defence			2
who will be kicking @entity134 into @entity135 ? as long as he does n't have to make another memorable cameo appearance in goal , @entity23 will be the one to let @entity134 know he 's in a game			0
@entity10 captain @entity139 will try and fill holes , but he may be pre-occupied with the forward running if @entity3 's man of the moment @entity142			2
@entity134 ( right ) and @entity142 will have to avoid the tough tackling of @entity23 @entity145 ( left ) was the @entity146 's third - highest goalscorer last season how will they line - up ? @entity150 's side are likely to line - up in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation with their 2014 @entity146 talisman , @entity153 striker @entity145 , leading the line			0
tuesday night 's away side will try and settle into their own half and wait for chances on the counter-attack to make the most of their pacey wingers			0
should @entity3 break down @entity10 ' defence , you 'd expect @entity165 to end up on top as the @entity11 have a habit of conceding late on			1
season so far the @entity11 champions have n't had the best of starts to their 2014 - 15 domestic campaign			1
ludogorets have won just 15 points from eight games but that 's enough to keep them in fourth , just two points off the pace behind @entity180 .			0

@entity10 will make @entity7 debut vs @entity3 on tuesday
@entity11 champions were found in 2001 , almost three years after @entity46 made his @entity3 debut
@entity23 's goalkeeping heroics helped @entity10 win @entity7 play - off
@entity3 return to @entity7 for first time in five years
