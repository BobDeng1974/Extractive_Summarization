@entity0 is quickly building a reputation as one of @entity4 's leading personal trainers , and it 's a world away from the dark days of steroid abuse			1
@entity0 , 30 , readily admits he ' crashed and burned ' on illegal substances a few years ago and his advice to teenage boys wanting to ' get on the gear ' is to ' forget it , there 's no quick fix and it 's not worth it '			1
he told @entity15 his story of trying body - building drugs and how damaging the experience actually was and his fears for the new generation of young gym junkies			2
@entity25 left the much bulkier version using steroids , while at right is the clean @entity0 version @entity0 pictured with competitors he trained for the recent @entity32 competition held in @entity33 ' steroids were n't for me , so i went back to the basics - hard work and good nutrition and that 's what i teach ' said @entity0 , seen here in sprinting training ' i ’ve been training since i was about 17 and was in mining when i started ( using ) , ' he admitted			1
' it was before i knew what i was doing , i thought that ( taking steroids ) was the answer , the people i was hanging around at the time , they did it and they were telling me how good it was and so i gave it a go			1
heart problems high cholesterol levels higher then lower sex drive depression and no motivation hair loss and acne permanent liver damage ' but i just did n’t get the results , there were massive highs but then terrible lows , you 'd crash and burn			1
' the burgeoning business of illicit performance enhancing substances led to more than 10,000 detections by @entity72 in the 2012 - 13 year - a record number - double those of @entity75 and five times more than cocaine seizures			0
@entity0 calls himself a @entity77 and hopes to keep spreading the message of hard work and good nutrition , taking teams to natural body - building events as proof it works			1
. but he fears the new generation of gym junkies are doing themselves harm			0
' the problem for these kids , 18 , 19 or in the early 20s , is they see all the images out of @entity92 and all the pros , who live on steroids , and they want to get like that , quickly , ' @entity0 said			1
' most of our team ( at the @entity99 ) was there for the first time ' @entity0 said of the clients he had brought through his cutting edge performance workouts @entity0 in different guises			1
at play ( left ) in a natural body - building event and at work ( right ) getting ready for his next client at @entity109 ' i was assuming the same , that i was gon na get big and strong but the side effects are the thing			1
' when you take it , yes , you think it i am strong and you feel you ’re invincible , you feel awesome at the time but then there is that other side of it when you just do n’t feel right , you do n’t feel like going to train , you get lazy , you get down and could n’t be bothered going to the gym			0
' ' i did n’t expect to be where i am now , it is crazy to see the transformation in my own life and i try to relate that to my other clients , particularly those who want to go on steroids			2
' i talk to them and and walk them through my own story			0
i have the experience to say to them " it 's wrong , it 's cheating " and hope they follow the plan i have			0
' i tell them my story because everyone wants that quick fix , that is why a lot of the young guys they are stuffing their bodies up for later in life			0
' there 's no real correlation to draw on , no long - term studies , but in the next 10 years there will be a lot of that coming to light and a lot of guys into their 20s right now , they might feel great now and in the next 12 months , things might change			2
@entity0 says his clients , including his partner @entity158 ( on the left ) , a bikini pro and @entity161 ( right ) are both proof his plan works , having both won international competitions @entity0 oversees the wokout of another client , @entity167 , ' who competed last year and won his division for the @entity32 male fitness and come second for overall in @entity171 ' ' you 've got to ask though , are they gon na crash out in 10 years			1
what 's gon na be the state of the body and the state of mind , if they have been cheating			0
' but worse still , he said , is the affect it can have on sex drive			1
' look , fact is , when you are on it ( a cycle ) , you have so much testosterone in your system , it is n't a problem but when you come off it , it 's not the same , it 's a lot harder to sustain anything or even feel like it ( sex ) , you could say it 's a bit of a problem , ' he said			1
' and that ’s when a lot of the guys just stay on it , you get sick of not maintaining normality , so they choose never to get off the drugs - it ’s like any other addiction			0
' like a junkie , you ca n't function a normal life			1
' the thing is , you are judged if you are a heroin junkie , many see it as disgusting whereas if it is steroids you 're using people are a lot less likely to judge , but the fact is they are both @entity213 drugs , they are both considered as serious as each other by authorities			2
' all those substances are so foreign to your body , and the part of the brain which controls the hormones and endocrine system senses an overload of testosterone and shuts off the normal production and it says " ok we do n’t need to produce any more " , it can have a long term effect			2
' that ’s why people get so dependent on it , i know a few guys who are dependent on it because they have had so much and in their minds they have to keep going , otherwise they just crash			2
it 's one extreme to the next			0
' ' i 've competed in six or seven natural body - building events and i 'm proud of what i 'm doing now for myself and my team ' @entity0 said but @entity0 is proud of how he turned it all around			2
' i decided in 2012 that i needed to leave the mining and construction lifestyle behind and come back into something i really loved doing , going to the gym every day , ' he said			0
' after i bottomed out , i recovered and got back into training and thought that ( drugs ) was not the answer and i had to learn how to actually train properly and did a fitness business course and changed my whole perspective on what is healthy and what is not			0
' that 's why that happened to me , i learned of the physiological changes that happen , learned a lot more about nutrition and got out into the workforce			0
' we work hard for natural body building preparation , i 've done about 6 or 7 shows , the difference is simple , rather than amazing big highs and equally big crashes , naturally you are fit and strong and stay that way by training properly			0
' i love training people properly , so that 's why i became a @entity269 , it 's full bore ahead from here			0
