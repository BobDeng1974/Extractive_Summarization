nestled in tranquil countryside , @entity0 was a treasured landmark for 600 years			2
now it is facing demolition after a 174mph @entity6 estate car careered off the road – smashing straight into the living room of owners @entity11 and @entity10			1
structural engineers are examining the locally - listed wattle and daub thatched cottage to see if its ancient oak frame was twisted in the smash			1
even if it is salvageable , the couple will have to move out for up to a year while the front of their home is rebuilt			2
fortunately , mrs and mr @entity24 were not in at the time of the crash at their home in @entity27 , @entity28 , and the driver of the £ 55,000 @entity31 car was uninjured			1
@entity62 officers said the @entity6 driver took evasive action , mounting the grass verge before going across the road , through the hedge and coming to a halt in the lounge of the building			2
the driver of the 2012 @entity6 and the couple ’s three cocker spaniels - who were inside the house - were unhurt			1
the couple 's living room is completely destroyed however , along with several antiques including a grandfather clock which mr @entity24 said is still standing but beyond repair			1
police are now trying to trace the driver of the @entity57 , which was a dark blue car			1
mrs @entity10 said : ‘ this is the third time we have had a car come through the hedge but this is by far the worst - we live in fear			1
thank @entity89 we were n’t in the living room			2
the method of constructing buildings using the wattle and daub technique dates back to the @entity96 period and is thought to have helped develop later methods of construction including lath and plaster and even cob			1
wattle and daub was used in parts of central @entity105 , western @entity106 , and north and south @entity107			1
it involves woven lattice strips of wood , called the wattle , being daubed with a sticky paste to hold it together			2
the paste was traditionally made from materials at hand , including animal dung and straw or mud and clay			0
‘ if we were we would have all been in the lounge and we had a great big unit in front of the window			0
that ’s obliterated and there are bricks embedded in the wall			0
‘ we have to find somewhere to stay now and that ’s hard with three dogs			0
the driver gets to go home to his nice warm house and we do n’t			2
’ fortunately for the couple and their dogs , a local farmer has offered to rent them a house while work continues on theirs			0
structural engineers attended the scene to assess the damage before the car could be removed			1
mr @entity24 said : ‘ it is going to be six to 12 months before we can go back in - we do n’t know yet if the house will have to be knocked down			2
‘ the part the car went into is 550 to 600 years old - it ’s just wattle and daub , and we do n’t know if the oak frame has been twisted			1
’ ‘ we heard a noise the night before and my dogs had been going mad			0
we thought a car had gone through the hedge so i went to look the morning after and there was a hole in it			2
‘ i got there and just saw this car sticking out of the hedge and the driver was just stood there looking very pale and shaken			1
i thought it had happened the night before but it had happened literally a few minutes before			0
’ whatever happens to the old house , mr @entity24 may have a job on his hands persuading his wife to move back to the property			0
historic : the part of the @entity28 cottage that the @entity6 car went into is an astonishing 550 to 600 years old evasive action : @entity62 officers said the @entity6 driver mounted the grass verge before going across the road , through the hedge and coming to a halt in the lounge of the building crash : mrs @entity10 said it was the third time the couple have had a car come through the hedge in @entity28 shock : mr @entity24 ( left ) said he ' just saw this car sticking out of the hedge ' next to the property in @entity28 accident : the @entity31 was driving along the @entity55 towards @entity56 at around 9.40am on monday carnage : the cottage was an absolute mess following the crash which took place on monday morning worry : mr @entity24 said the couple were unsure as to whether the house will have to be knocked down he told @entity199 : ' if the building has to be knocked down , it would be nice to rebuild further back from the road as it 's a lovely area			1
' but my wife is afraid to live here again , so i do n't know if we 'll return			0
' mr @entity24 described the dangerous stretch of road as ' crazy ' with several motorists killed in crashes since he moved in to the house 14 years ago			0
he said that the road is particularly busy when the motorway is closed and large lorries use the route as a diversion			0
' a truck would have gone straight through the house , ' he said			0
the last serious incident on the road before the @entity6 crash saw an 18 - year - old girl killed in a crash close to mr @entity24 's home			1
danger spot : a previous crash at the cottage saw a car come over the hedgerow upside down			1
it was only stopped from hitting the property by another parked car the house came close to suffering serious damage last year when another car came over the hedgerow			1
mr @entity24 said : ' it came through the hedge upside down and it was going to hit the property , but fortunately we had a car parked there and it hit that and was pushed along the side of the house instead			2
' the technique of wattle and daub dates back 6,000 years			1
@entity250 is the building of walls by weaving sticks in and out of upright posts - and daubing is the weather - proofing with manure , earth and clay			0
the house , known as @entity261 , is thought to have been home to local prophet @entity263			0
born in the 15th century , he became known as the @entity265 and is said to have predicted the @entity266 and the outcome of the @entity268			0
he is even said to have foretold his own death			0
@entity263 was summoned to the court of @entity271 but refused to go saying that he would be ' clemmed ' - or starved - to death			0
@entity271 ordered that he be keep in the court 's kitchens but he was caught stealing food from the pantries and locked in a cupboard by the cook			0
he was left in the cupboard and starved to death when the cook was called away			0
close call : a previous crash saw a car land on its roof just inches from the house before : the interior of @entity287 before the car plowed through the wall ruined : the car came through the wall into a 600 year old part of the house no protection : the historic cottage is hidden behind a row of bushes , but it is n't enough to stop cars ploughing through it dangerous stretch : the @entity24 's home is situated right next to the busy @entity55 road			1
