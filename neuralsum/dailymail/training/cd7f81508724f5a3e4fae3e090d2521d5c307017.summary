@entity1 holidaymakers struck down by a crippling bug have accused an @entity4 hotel of trying to blame their illness on sunstroke			1
several bed - bound tourists were hooked up to iv drips and given antibiotics , and some even collapsed as the mass outbreak swept through the four - star @entity12 complex			1
at least 100 people – including staff – were thought to be suffering from @entity16 , which causes diarrhoea , stomach cramps and fever , at the @entity19 resort earlier this summer			1
no reason to smile : a doctor , left , poses with @entity25 after she became ill at an @entity4 resort however , some holidaymakers have accused the hotel of trying to blame the outbreak on people spending too much time in the sun. after the resort 's medical centre was inundated with sick tourists – and extra doctors were brought in to cope - a letter was circulated to guests called ' @entity39 and how to stay healthy '			1
it informed holidaymakers about the dangers of high temperature , lack of fluids and overexposure			1
it also advised guests to ' avoid handling food with bare hands as bacteria multiply in hot weather ' , and it suggested staff had been following the same practice			1
on - site doctors also later suggested sunstroke as the cause of their illness – after prescribing medication to fight infections			0
despite the outbreak one of the docs even found time to pose for a smiling snap with an ill patient in their room			0
many guests who fell ill complained about poor hygiene among staff and in the buffets			1
they claimed chefs and waiters handled raw and cooked food and served with their bare hands and dirty utensils			0
holidaymaker @entity25 , who fell ill along with her 16 - year - old son @entity77 , said she was confined to her room for a week while they were both attached to drips			1
at least 100 people , including staff , were thought to be suffering from @entity16 at @entity12 the 42 - year - old from @entity84 , @entity85 , said she was unable to leave her bed and had blood in her faeces , and her husband , also ill , had to clean up after her and their son			1
she was shocked when on - site medics blamed the sun for the sickness that ruined their getaway in july			2
@entity25 said : ' one of the emergency doctors said we had too much sun i could n't believe his cheek			0
we have been in much hotter weather in @entity103 every other year and we take all the precautions so i knew it was n't the sun. ' my husband tried to get the reps to close the hotel but they refused so new people were arriving all the time and then getting ill. ' it was horrendous , i would n't wish what i had on my worst enemy , i was so sick that i thought i might die			2
' nightmare : on - site doctors prescribed medication and suggested sunstroke as the cause of the illness she said the dining room tables were never wiped down properly in between meals and the food was always lukewarm			0
she said : ' there were no real hygiene practices but overnight that all changed as if someone had flicked a switch			0
all the staff had gloves on and everyone was forced to use sanitiser in the buffets but by then it was too late			2
' it was reported that extra doctors were brought in to cope with the outbreak			2
after she collapsed in the toilet , @entity25 encountered a queue of ill people , including the catering manager , at the on - site medical centre			0
she said the tour operator , @entity144 , refused to admit anything was wrong , and the rep was confronted by queue of angry guests			1
when her husband snapped a photo as evidence a smiling doctor posed beside her on her bed			0
the hotel later told guests they were flushing the water system with chlorine , leaving @entity25 to wonder why staff would do that if everyone was just suffering sunstroke			1
' it was horrendous ' : it was reported that extra doctors were brought in to cope with the outbreak after the nightmarish trip @entity25 and her son spent a week quarantined at home and are still feeling the effects			2
she is vowing never to travel to @entity4 again			0
@entity144 said : ' all guests at the hotel get a letter addressing the risks of heat - related illnesses in welcome packs			1
' it is given throughout the season and is not as a result of any reported cases of sickness			1
' @entity180 , from @entity181 , spent most of her family 's £ 3,000 trip ill in bed and said the letter was given to her two days before she returned home with her husband and 15 - year - old son , who also became ill. ' it stinks			2
they were trying to shift the blame on to the sun when they knew it was a bug doing the rounds in the hotel			0
' i think it 's disgraceful			0
they were using the letter to try and make people think they had sunstroke instead of a bug			2
there is nothing in it to suggest an illness that 's going round which was the case			0
' she added : ' it was very sneaky of them and they knew there was an outbreak as their own animation staff were all ill as well and they had to cancel events			2
' all they wanted to do was to sweep it under the carpet rather than admit a problem which would probably have saved lots of people from getting very ill and ruining their holiday			0
' shigella : most reported cases of shigellosis in the @entity1 are travel related , public health officials say she said @entity144 offered a ' paltry ' amount of compensation just days after the family returned home			1
she added : ' i could n't believe it			0
i told them not until we get the result of hospital blood tests to see what was wrong			0
' since then we have n't been able to get hold of them			0
i just think they wanted to buy our silence			0
' last night @entity249 of @entity250 who is handling claims from 250 guests who fell ill at the hotel said : ' tour operators have a duty to make sure that their customers are safe and should be advising people who are ill to seek medical treatment , not passing off or covering up illness with shoddy excuses such as sunstroke or a change in climate			0
' the bug behind the illness @entity16 can be devastating with 2 % of victims going on to suffer chronic arthritis in later life			1
it is vital that appropriate medical treatment is received immediately – especially for the young , elderly and those with weakened immune systems ' it would be outrageous if the tour operator was attempting to muddy the waters by intimating to its customers that the massive outbreak of sickness was caused by sunstroke , which is what the letter seems to imply			1
' this letter went out when the tour operator knew that numerous guests were being hooked up to intravenous drips in their bedrooms and being fed a barrage of antibiotics because the medical centre was over-crowded .			1

holidaymakers were confined to their beds and hooked up to iv drips
at least 100 guests and staff thought to be suffering from @entity16
@entity144 says letter ' is not as a result of any reported cases of sickness '
