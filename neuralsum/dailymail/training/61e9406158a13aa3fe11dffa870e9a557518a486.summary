a father - of - six has come up with a novel way of raising spirits for mourners at his funeral - by buying himself a coffin built in the shape of a giant @entity9 bottle			1
former soldier @entity10 started planning his own funeral after seeing eight @entity13 pals killed during the @entity15 war			1
the 48 - year - old , from @entity17 , paid a @entity19 - based firm £ 3,000 for the ten - foot high replica of a bottle of his favourite tipple			1
mr @entity10 commissioned the bespoke coffin based on his favourite drink when he decided his funeral needed to be a celebration of his life mr @entity10 , who spent 22 years with the @entity27 , said : ' while working in @entity15 after i had a very close call			1
' over a 28 - day period in february 2007 i was attacked 74 times and there were some days we would get three or four hits in one day			2
' i was attacked by heavy machine gun fire , ieds and roadside bombs			0
' i lost eight colleagues			0
at the time i thought i would have to plan my funeral because something could go wrong			2
' i did n't want a normal funeral and it had to be a celebration of life because i have been to too many funerals of colleagues where they were very sad occasions			1
' i wanted something completely different and i decided my favourite drink is @entity9			1
' it just happened when i was at home on leave i saw an @entity53 programme and i found the company			0
former soldier @entity10 testing how the coffin fits while its creator , @entity56 , looks on ' i asked would it be possible to make it and the answer was yes			1
my friends see the funny side of it , but mum and my grandparents are not too impressed			1
' mr @entity10 jetted over from @entity65 , where he is working as a private security guard , this week to take a first glimpse at his novelty buy			1
he said : ' it is absolutely fantastic			0
when i opened it i could not believe the detail and the artwork			0
' they have done a fantastic job			0
it was strange getting into it			0
mr @entity10 said @entity78 had done a ' fantastic job ' on the unusual 10ft tall coffin ' my headstone is going to have a solar - panelled ipad			1
i plan to leave a video message with pictures of the coffin from start to finish			2
' i am also going to approach @entity88 to see if they will take me to the service in one of their delivery vans			0
' i have even planned my music			0
i will be coming in to @entity94 from the @entity95 singing ' my way ' because i am doing everything my way and always have done			0
' the team that built the coffin spent hours doing the signwriting and creating the right curves of the bottle his unique coffin is not the only unusual trick mr @entity10 is planning for his funeral			1
he also plans to ask @entity88 if it will take his body to the service in one of its delivery vans and he will play ' my way ' by @entity94 @entity115 helped set up @entity116 ten years ago after a string of unusual requests from customers			0
mr @entity115 , a coffin maker of 25 years , said : ' it all started when someone knocked at the door asking for an aeroplane coffin			2
' it never crossed our mind that coffin makers did this before that			2
we have done canal boats and mobile phones and each request seems more bizarre			0
' this design was very complicated because there are so many curves in a @entity9 bottle and it is almost cut like a diamond			1
' we have never had to do so much sign - writing before either			0
we built it bit by bit because the man was fighting fit and healthy so we knew there was no rush			2

@entity10 had a £ 3000 coffin built in the shape of a @entity9 bottle
