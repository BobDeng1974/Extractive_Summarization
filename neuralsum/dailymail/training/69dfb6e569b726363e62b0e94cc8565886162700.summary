@entity2 is selling the historic brands to @entity11 drinks group @entity7 after putting them up for sale earlier this year			1
@entity4 and @entity5 , which date back to 1927 and the 1930s respectively , are made in the @entity15 at a factory in @entity17 , @entity18 , which employs around 500 staff			1

@entity4 is the @entity15 's top - selling energy and sports drink , while blackcurrant drink @entity5 is the fourth - best selling fruit juice and concentrate			1
the two drinks brands achieved combined sales of £ 600million last year but three quarters of sales were in the @entity15 , while they have virtually no presence in emerging markets where @entity2 sees its future growth potential			1
@entity2 chief strategy officer @entity72 said @entity4 and @entity5 have made a huge contribution over the years , and their future is in ‘ good hands ’			1
he said : ‘ now is the right time to sell them as we increase the focus of our consumer healthcare business and execute the delivery of our late stage pipeline of pharmaceuticals and vaccines			0
’ @entity2 said the ‘ vast majority ’ of staff at @entity17 and working in commercial , research and development will transfer to @entity7			1
@entity2 will continue to make and distribute the drinks in @entity92 under licence from @entity7			1

it debuted on the stock market earlier this year with a float that raised £ 2.6billion			0
the cash deal is expected to complete by the end of the year , subject to regulatory @entity106 , which is part of the £ 12billion turnover @entity108 , said the drinks ' sales networks will help it grow its other brands in countries such as @entity92 and @entity114			0
the sale also prevents what could have turned into an auction for the brands which are said to have attracted considerable interest from private equity groups including @entity121 and @entity122 , and were also reportedly in the sights of @entity126 owner @entity124			2
in the three months to the end of june , @entity4 sales grew 4 per cent but @entity5 was down 2 per cent			1
' @entity129 ' was first brewed in 1927 by @entity130 , a chemist in @entity131			0

by 1929 , then renamed @entity4 , it was stocked in most @entity15 hospitals			1
a great success , the fizzy orange drink caught the eye of soft drink magnate @entity143 - which would become @entity2 - in 1938			1
by the early 1950s , they would rely on @entity4 to bring in half their profits			2
until 1982 , it was sold in a glass bottle with yellow cellophane wrapping			0
but in 1983 , renamed and reformed management @entity2 gave the beverage a makeover			2
the slogan changed from ' @entity4 aids recovery ' to ' @entity4 replaces lost energy ' - with a plastic bottle brought in instead			1
with @entity159 decathlete @entity158 as the face and a range of new flavours , it became the brand success story of the 1980s			0
in 1990 , @entity40 was launched , with stars such as @entity34 's @entity165 , @entity166 and rugby national @entity167 heading up their various advertising campaigns			0
their novelty editions include ' @entity170 ' in 2001 , fashioned to coincide with the film @entity47 - taking its name from @entity174 's character @entity44			2
since its launch , @entity4 remains the leading brand in the energy drinks category			1
invented in 1938 as a pure fruit syrup , dr @entity179 was trying to find something to add to his milkshake			0
the name ' @entity5 ' comes from ' @entity184 ' - the botanical name for blackcurrant - meant to reflect the natural content , rich in @entity187 during @entity191 , other @entity187 sources like oranges , made in @entity190 , were difficult to get hold of			2
the government encouraged growth of blackcurrants and the manufacture of this new sweet cordial , delivered to children 's homes for free - at first without the brand name			0
after a steady rise in popularity , then - owners carters were bought out by @entity2 in 1955			2

other versions have included raspberry , strawberry and peach flavours			0
issues have arisen over the stated level of @entity187 content and number of berries used			0
the suggestion that ' 95 per cent of @entity15 berries ' are used to produce the drink came under fire in the 1990s			2
their branding now states that ' most ' berries are used .			0
