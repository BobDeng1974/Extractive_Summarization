by @entity0 published : 09:39 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 13:26 est , 16 november 2012 radiation is something we usually think we want to avoid , but in fact every second thousands of tiny isotopes are bursting with radioactive decay right inside your body			2
at the same time , all around you imperceptible gamma rays are exploding in an invisible light show			1
now a group of musicians - cum - scientists has harnessed the activity of this low - level radiation to compose music - and perform live using a lump of uranium on stage			1
the spectra signature of cobalt 60 : a group of musicians - cum - scientists has harnessed the activity of this low - level radiation to compose music @entity26 musician @entity25 conceived of the @entity27 about a year ago and last spring the group released their first album			1
but now he has taken the project to the next level with a live performance			0
mr @entity25 performs his live concerts by moving a small , low - activity sample of radioactive material back and forth near a gamma spectrometer , creating a pulsating rhythm			1
using the live isotope signatures in conjunction with live audio performance software he can quickly create repeating loops and build them into the kinds of tracks you might hear in @entity47 nightclub			0
mr @entity25 worked with nuclear physicists to create algorithms that translates the way gamma radiation is emitted from various isotopes into sequences of tones			1
consisting of photons , gamma radiation is essentially the same kind of radiation as light and radio waves , but with a much higher level of energy			2
it is present all around us , and indeed within us , sometimes from naturally occurring sources and other times from man - made sources , the @entity27 explain on their website			2
@entity25 performing at @entity69 's @entity68 : he performs his live concerts by moving a small , low - activity sample of radioactive material back and forth near a gamma spectrometer , creating a pulsating rhythm gamma radiation is high frequency and high energy electromagnetic radiation often produced by the decay of atomic nuclei			2
discovered in 1900 by @entity82 chemist and physicist @entity83 , they are a form of ionising radiation and are as a result biologically hazardous			0
natural sources of gamma rays on @entity89 include gamma decay from naturally occurring radioisotopes , and secondary radiation from atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles			1
all ionizing radiation causes similar damage at a cellular level , but gamma rays are particularly hazardous since they are more penetrating , causing damage throughout the body			1
effects can include radiation sickness , cell dna damage , cell death due to damaged dna , and increasing incidence of cancer			0
@entity107 , a physicist at @entity26 nuclear safety and training organization @entity108 , told @entity110 the method correlates accurately to what science understands about radioactive material			0
' the decay of @entity116 gives gamma - radiation of two very distinct energy levels , @entity119 and 1.33 mev			0
these numbers can be translated to two different tones , ' mr @entity107 told the @entity123 news broadcaster			0
the @entity27 album was produced in collaboration with music producer @entity126 , who created songs based on melodies and sounds from the software			1
the group say on their website : ' the musical and artistic ambition [ of the project ] is about exploring a world that is not available to our senses and finding musically interesting pattens and to render them in a way that both resonates with popular culture while staying close to the subject matter			0
' the pedagogical aspect aims to inspire young people to learn about the natural sciences by making one of its most hidden phenomena available in a new way and exposing complexity and beauty in the strange world of the atomic nuclei – using music			0
