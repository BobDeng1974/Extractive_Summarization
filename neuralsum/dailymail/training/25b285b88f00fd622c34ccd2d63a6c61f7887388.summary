lord @entity0 , who was chief of the general staff between 2006 and 2009 , made a personal plea to @entity5 for a no vote , stating more than 100 @entity5 members of the armed forces had fought and died defending the @entity7 during the @entity19			1
he said : ' do the families of @entity5 soldiers who lost their lives between 1969 and 2007 to preserve the territorial integrity of the @entity7 now just say , " well , it no longer matters " ? ' i can not speak for them , but i wonder just how much thought , appreciation and recognition is given to the memory of those who have fought and brought this @entity7 of ours to where it is today , and where it could be in the future			1
' and i really worry on behalf of the wives , mothers and friends of those @entity5 soldiers who died to keep @entity13 in the @entity7			1
' i worry particularly about the extent that we will be letting them down if @entity5 disappears from our country , just on the whim of a few thousand voters willing to gamble on an uncertain future rather than staying within the @entity7 , whose track record is second to none in @entity47			2
' lord @entity0 added in the @entity48 that he felt defence was the ' weakest link ' for an independent @entity5			1
it comes after a host of senior military figures have raised concerns about independence in relation to the country 's defences in the months leading up to the crucial vote , with former @entity61 commander general sir @entity60 even branding it ' dangerous '			2
but @entity63 , the @entity64 's defence spokesman , responded : ' a dangerous and amateurish defence policy would be one that sent troops into an illegal war without proper equipment , while wasting tens of billions of pounds on @entity70 nuclear weapons that can never be used - that 's the @entity7			0
' shadow foreign secretary @entity71 dismissed the remarks			0
' i am unyielding in my admiration and respect for the men and women of the @entity7 armed forces and the contribution that @entity5 have played and continue to play in those forces , ' he told @entity82 programme			0
' but many @entity7 soldiers have given their lives over the years to defeat fascism and then to defend democracy and let 's be absolutely clear : what we are witnessing here in @entity5 on thursday is an exercise in democracy			1
' so i hold no brief for @entity0 this morning			0
' @entity5 deputy first minister @entity94 said the former military chief 's comments ' bordered on being offensive and insulting '			1
' there are mixed opinions across the armed forces as there are across @entity5 society			0
' veterans of the @entity103 wearing combat armbands as a mark of respect to comrades who have lost their lives in in @entity109 during a remembrance service at the @entity111 in @entity112 ( file picture ) deputy first minister @entity94 , seen here on the campaign trail with @entity116 , said @entity0 's comments were ' offensive and insulting ' lord @entity0 's intervention comes after five former @entity119 warmed that a yes vote in the @entity5 referendum would do ‘ immense damage ’ to @entity7 ’s armed forces			1
in a letter to the @entity124 , @entity126 sir @entity125 , @entity126 sir @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity126 sir @entity130 and vice adml @entity131 , the president of @entity132 , said splitting the union would be seen as an ‘ act of destruction ’ and @entity5 might struggle to recruit soldiers			2
the latest warning follows a string of similar cautions from senior serving and former members of the @entity142 that independence risks damaging national security for both @entity145 and @entity5			2
they wrote that the ‘ grave implications ’ of splitting the @entity7 in two in terms of security and employment related to defence had not been spelt out to voters			0
@entity154 would be lost at @entity155 and at @entity156 and @entity157 , under a split , the letter predicts			0
orders for 13 new @entity161 frigates may well not be placed in an independent @entity5 .			0

lord @entity0 , who was chief of general staff between 2006 and 2009 , urged @entity5 to vote no
he said independence would be ' letting down ' the more than 100 @entity5 soldiers who died in @entity13
lord @entity0 : ' do the families of those who lost their lives now just say " well , it no longer matters " ?
@entity5 deputy first minister @entity94 said his comments bordered on being " offensive and insulting "
