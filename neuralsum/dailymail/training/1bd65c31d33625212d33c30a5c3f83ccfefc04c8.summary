@entity2 , 43 , was been handed a six - month conditional discharge for possessing the illegal drug			1
she said she uses cannabis every day as medical relief from her condition , which sees her battle muscle spasms , headaches , bladder problems and tremors on a daily basis			0
now ms @entity2 has been told she will face a ' much worse punishment ' if she is caught possessing the class b drug in the next six months			1
but the former @entity24 special constable has said she will carry on smoking cannabis regardless of the law			0
the mother - of - one , who was diagnosed with @entity6 17 years ago , said : ' i 'm not going to stop doing it			1
' if i gave up cannabis , the results would be absolutely devastating			0
i smoke it every day and it has helped me to live a relatively normal life			0
' it calms me down , relaxes my muscles , stops my shakes and helps keep my mild epilepsy under control			0
' ms @entity2 , who is on daily medication including injections for her condition , branded her sentence ' completely unjust '			1
she said : ' i have given so much to the community through my work as a special constable and i feel let down by the justice system			0
' it 's as if i am being prosecuted for being ill. ' the former community support officer from @entity50 , @entity51 , was arrested on december 22 after her neighbours smelt the drug and alerted the police			1
it was the third time in nine months that police had raided her home , and she had already received a warning and a caution			0
ms @entity2 says she uses cannabis every day to give her relief from the headaches , spasms and tremors caused by her condition representing her at @entity66 , @entity67 , said : ' every so often , a case comes along that really should n't be in the court - and this is one of those cases			1

everyone should have the right to use cannabis for medical purposes , especially people with severe , life - changing conditions like multiple sclerosis			2
' she should have received an absolute discharge and i think it 's a disgrace that she did n't			2
