by @entity0 published : 03:02 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 10:47 est , 1 november 2012 pride : @entity2 has been threatened with 12 months in prison for fly tipping after she swept leaves into the road outside her home for a council road sweeper to collect a grandmother of four has been threatened with jail for sweeping the leaves outside her home			1
@entity2 , 82 , was accused of ' causing a hazard ' by brushing the fallen leaves into a ' large heap ' for roadsweepers to collect			1
she was warned her simple attempts to keep the neighbourhood tidy could leave her facing prosecution for fly - tipping , punishable by a £ 50,000 fine and a 12 - month jail term			1
when mrs @entity2 queried the letter , she was astonished to discover council contractors had photographed her gardener , who visits once a fortnight , sweeping the leaves into the street			1
and the council even defended its stance by claiming that her behaviour was ' unacceptable '			0
mrs @entity2 , who worked as the financial director of a printing business she ran with her late husband , branded the council officials ‘ petty bureaucrats ’ as she told of her anger over the letter ’s threatening tone			2
she said : ‘ it ’s bureaucracy gone mad			0
i ’m not a person who wants to make a fuss but it was a shock to read that letter			2
‘ when i challenged the district council officer and asked him how he knew i ’d cleared the leaves into the road from the front of my house , he said they had photos to prove it			1
‘ i like to keep my house neat and tidy			2
the council told me to use my green bin – but that is soon full of garden waste because they only empty it once a fortnight			0
i ’m just annoyed that the council can treat me like this			0
’ the mother of two first moved to her part of @entity63 , @entity64 , in the 1950s with her husband @entity66 , who died of cancer in 1997 at the age of 71			0
following his death she moved round the corner to her three - bedroom bungalow , which is in a road lined with lime trees			2
leafy : mrs @entity2 's tree - lined street in @entity63			1
the grandmother - of - four has lived in the area for 50 years in a letter sent last week , an official from the district council warned mrs @entity2 : ‘ you were seen removing leaves from your front garden and depositing them in the road channel in front of your property			1
‘ abandoning material in this manner constitutes fly - tipping under section 33 of the @entity93 , which is punishable by a fine of up to £ 50,000 and / or 12 months ’ imprisonment			2
’ a spokesman for the authority told the @entity98 yesterday that during the autumn , road sweepers are sent once a week to 100 of the worst roads for leaf fall in the district – one of which is mrs @entity2 ’s			1
but she claims the sweepers do not come ‘ for weeks ’ at a time , so she frequently has to sweep up the leaves from her garden , driveway and the footpath			0
neat and tidy : mrs @entity2 says that the council have told her to use her green bin but she says that is often too full as it is only empty once a fortnight mrs @entity2 said : ‘ i ’ve lived through the war and have been in this town all my life			2
i pay my council tax and should receive this service			0
i ’ve got better things to worry about at my age than this			0
’ her family have also played a significant role in the town			0
her husband acted as mace bearer for the mayor , while his brother , @entity131 , and father , @entity133 , were both mayors in their time			0
mrs @entity2 said the council has now dropped its threat to prosecute after she promised to stop the sweeping			1
she turned down the authority ’s offer to supply her with a second green bin – for a £ 35 charge			0
she will now put the leaves into refuse sacks , which a friend will drive to the council waste disposal centre			0
a council spokesman said the ‘ very large heap ’ of leaves from mrs @entity2 ’s lawn which had been left in the ‘ road channel ’ were a ‘ hazard ’ , which caused cars to move further into the road			1
he added : ‘ moving the leaves in this manner is unacceptable and can cause additional problems with blocking of drains			0
the @entity159 would like to apologise if the letter sent to mrs @entity2 caused any concern			1
’ he added that the letter had been addressed to ‘ @entity164 ’ , not mrs @entity2 herself			2
her local mp , conservative @entity166 said he was ' disappointed ' about the council 's action			0
he said : ' as mrs @entity2 's member of parliament it 's my job to represent people like her , particularly in dealing with local bureaucracy and issues with the @entity159 and as such it 's a shame i was n't able to get involved in this case			1
' i 'm particularly disappointed that the @entity159 's officers seem to have chosen such a confrontational approach from the outset rather than perhaps asking her local councillor to intervene or simply sending a less threatening warning letter			1

@entity159 warned @entity2 the tidying - up was ' hazard ' to cars using road
they even ' took photos ' of widow 's gardener sweeping leaves outside house
@entity195 says : ' i do n't want to make a fuss but i was so shocked '
