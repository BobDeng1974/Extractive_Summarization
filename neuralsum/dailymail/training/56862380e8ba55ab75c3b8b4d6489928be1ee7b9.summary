by @entity0 published : 08:37 est , 13 january 2014 updated : 10:56 est , 13 january 2014 a mother - of - five nearly died after paramedics misdiagnosed two brain haemorrhages as a virus			1
@entity6 , 42 , was in agony with excruciating headaches and regular black - outs but 999 crews dismissed the serious bleeds on the brain as sinusitis			1
but two sets of paramedics who were called to the teaching assistant ’s home on december 16 and 18 both failed to spot the tell - tale signs of the deadly condition			1
@entity6 and her husband , @entity21 , were twice told by paramedics that she was suffering from a virus when , in fact , she had had two brain haemorrhages and despite her first - aid trained husband @entity21 , 50 , telling medics he feared it might be a stroke or blood clot , she was left at home and prescribed painkillers			1
when she was finally diagnosed on december 19 with the life - threatening haemorrhages , doctors had to battle to save her life in an emergency six - hour operation			1
miraculously , she survived and is recovering at home in @entity40 , @entity41			1
the furious couple are now demanding an apology from @entity44 who confirmed they are investigating the matter			1
mrs @entity6 has criticised the paramedics who left her a ‘ ticking time - bomb ’ and accused them of ‘ leaving her to die ’			1
she said : ‘ it was an awful time in my life , i was in agony - i thought my head was going to explode , it was that painful			1
mrs @entity6 ( pictured with her husband before her illness ) called paramedics on december 16 and december 18 when she suffered excruciating headaches			1
both times she was left at home with painkillers ‘ i knew something was wrong , but you have to listen to the paramedics when they give you the answers			1
‘ it has been horrific not just for me but for my family and friends , i was scared and did n’t know what was going to happen to me			0
a brain haemorrhage is bleeding in or around the brain			2
it can be caused by a head injury but can also happen spontaneously as a result of a ruptured aneurysm			0
symptoms include a sudden , very severe headache , vomiting , fits , loss of consciousness and sudden death			0
a brain haemorrhage is a medical emergency which requires immediate treatment			1
the two treatment options are using medication to prevent further bleeding , and surgery to repair the source of the bleeding			0
@entity92 most often occur as the result of a brain aneurysm bursting - a brain aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel 's wall			1
people who smoke , drink heavily , have poorly controlled high blood pressure or who have a family history of aneurysms are most at risk			0
about 65 per cent of brain haemorrhage patients survive but many find their recovery slow and frustrating			2
about 9,000 people in the @entity110 have a brain haemorrhage every year			2
four out of five patients are aged between 40 and 65			0
they are more common in women than men			0
source : @entity116 ‘ day to day life is hard , although i am trying to get back to full health and hopefully be who i used to be , but it will be a long road			2
‘ i am very disappointed with the @entity44 and definitely feel they could have done more			1
i was just hours from dying			0
‘ they gave me a death sentence and i want changes to be made and i do n’t want this happening to anyone else			0
‘ no family should have to go through what my family have had to endure in these past few weeks			0
‘ i am just glad to be here and feel so lucky that i am alive and with my children and husband again			0
’ mrs @entity6 suffered the first haemorrhage on december 16 and the second on december 18 - but on both occasions paramedics failed to spot the deadly bleed on the brain			1
her gp finally sent her to @entity140 on december 19 where she was diagnosed			1
she was then taken to @entity142 ’s @entity141 where she underwent a gruelling operation to save her life			1
from her hospital bed she even sent text messages telling her husband that she feared she was going to die			2
one read : ‘ i am frightened and scared and do n’t know the outcome			0
’ mr @entity149 , an operations manager , added : ‘ it was horrific - i thought , how can i tell our five boys what has happened to their mum and that she might die			2
‘ lots of different things were flooding through my mind , she is the engine of the family , i do n’t know what we ’d do without her			0
on december 19 mrs @entity6 went to her gp who was so concerned about her health that she was sent straight to hospital where she was diagnosed and had a six - hour emergency operation to save her life ‘ it was pure fight how she pulled through , no - one knows medically how she managed it , it truly is a miracle			1
‘ the nurses in the hospital nicknamed her @entity175 and a few people have been putting that in her get well soon cards , it has stuck and it is a fitting nickname			2
mrs @entity6 has now been released from hospital but she is still struggling to walk and talk normally ‘ however , i am absolutely furious with the @entity44			1
i am no professional , far from it , but you can @entity180 the symptoms she was suffering from and it comes back with meningitis or a haemorrhage			0
‘ out of five medical professionals none of them managed to work out what was wrong with her and i think that is wrong			0
‘ the thing that makes matters worse is they were telling me to just give her strong painkillers , which i already was			2
‘ they just said she had sinusitis , you have to trust the medical professionals , you think they know best			0
‘ she was in floods of tears and she is not the sort of person to cry , she had an extremely high pain threshold			0
‘ essentially , i was just feeding her a time bomb , i was , without knowing , trying to clear a brain haemorrhage with painkillers			1
‘ it was only when i decided to take her to our doctors ’ surgery they said get her to a hospital right away , so i did , i drove her there myself			0
‘ they were very worried and took her in for tests straight away and that was when i got really worried - i thought she was going to die			2
‘ since all this has happened , i have heard nothing from the ambulance service , i want this to be stopped			0
‘ i do n’t want this happening to another family because it may be worse than what we had to go through			0
’ mrs @entity6 was finally discharged from hospital to go home with her family on january 6			1
mr @entity149 has now made a formal complaint to the ambulance service about the treatment his wife received she still needs help walking and struggles to talk but the family are hopeful she can make a full recovery			0
mr @entity149 added : ‘ she is getting better day by day now , i assist her to walk , her brain still does n’t give messages to her body correctly sometimes and simple words can be a struggle but we are just happy she is alive			2
’ a spokesperson for the @entity44 said : ‘ mr @entity149 has submitted a formal complaint about our response to his wife ’s illness and we have launched an investigation to establish the facts			2
‘ as soon as this is complete , we will pass on details of our findings to him direct			0
