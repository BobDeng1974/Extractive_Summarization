@entity1 's @entity0 is seen wiggling its wheels back and fourth during final checks before it sets off across the surface of @entity5			1
engineers at mission control have been running a series of tests before the one - ton vehicle 's first drive which is expected in the next couple of days			1
the images were taken by one of @entity0 's navigation cameras			1
@entity0 , a six - wheeled vehicle the size of a compact car , landed inside a vast , ancient impact crater near @entity5 ' equator on august 6 after an eight - month , 354 - million - mile voyage through space			1
the numbers around the edge are degrees of the compass and degrees below or above horizontal			0
the seven foot long robot arm contain a plethora of instruments , including : a camera to capture images for analysis a drill to get under the martian surface a spectrometer to analyse samples a scoop and mechanisms for sieving and portioning samples of powdered martian rock and soil earlier the @entity5 motor was shown flexing its extending robotic arm for the first time			1
the 7 - foot - long ( 2.1 - meter - long ) arm maneuvers a turret of tools including a camera , a drill , a spectrometer , a scoop and mechanisms for sieving and portioning samples of powdered rock and soil			2
the view ( above ) is a mosaic of low - resolution thumbnail images returned to @entity72 a few hours after the activity on @entity5 , with higher resolution versions set to follow			0
@entity0 landed on @entity5 two weeks ago to begin a two - year mission using 10 instruments to assess whether a carefully chosen study area inside @entity78 has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life			2
the @entity0 zapped its first rock on sunday with a high - powered laser gun designed to analyze @entity5 mineral content , and scientists declared their target practice a success			2
the robotic science lab aimed its laser beam at the fist - sized stone nearby and shot the rock with 30 pulses over a 10 - second period , @entity1 said in a statement issued from mission control at the @entity95 near @entity96			0
each pulse delivers more than 1 million watts of energy for about five one - billionths of a second , vapourising a pinhead - sized bit of the rock to create a tiny spark , which is analyzed by a small telescope mounted on the instrument			0
the ionized glow , which can be observed and recorded from up to 25 feet away , is then split into its component wavelengths by three spectrometers that give scientists information about the chemical makeup of the target rock			0
curiosity has begun its science mission on @entity5 by ' zapping ' a rock with its laser analysis equipment the combined system , called the @entity119 instrument , or @entity120 , is capable of discerning more than 6,000 different wavelengths in the ultraviolet , infrared and visible light spectrum and is designed to take about 14,000 measurements throughout @entity0 's @entity5 mission			1
the purpose of sunday 's initial use of the laser , conducted at roughly 3 a.m. @entity129 ( 7.00 a.m. edt ) , was as ' target practice ' for the instrument			0
but scientists will examine the data they receive to determine composition of the rock , which they dubbed ' @entity136 , ' @entity1 said			0
' we got a great spectrum of coronation - lots of signal , ' said @entity120 principal investigator @entity141 of the @entity142 in @entity143 , where the instrument was developed			0
' after eight years of building the instrument , it 's payoff time			0
' @entity0 's two - year mission is aimed at determining whether or not the planet most like @entity72 could have hosted microbial life			1
the first laser test by the @entity153 , or @entity120 , instrument aboard @entity1 's @entity0			1
the square inset is further magnified and processed to show the difference between images taken before and after the test the rover 's primary target is @entity160 , a towering mound of layered rock rising from the floor of @entity78			2
but mission controllers are gradually checking out @entity0 's sophisticated array of instruments before sending it on its first road trip across the @entity5 landscape			1
the $ 2.5 billion curiosity project marks @entity1 's first astrobiology mission since the @entity172 probes to @entity5 during the 1970s and the most advanced robotic science lab sent to another world			0
the technique employed by @entity120 has been used to examine the composition of materials in other extreme environments , such as inside nuclear reactors and on the sea floor			0
curiosity rover has also sent back its sharpest image of the 3 - mile - high ( 5 - kilometer - high ) mountain , called @entity160 the technology also has experimental applications in environmental monitoring and cancer detection			0
but sunday 's exercise , conducted during @entity0 's 13th full day on @entity5 , was the first use in interplanetary exploration , @entity1 said			2
before @entity0 embarks on its 4.3 - mile ( 7 - km ) trek to the foot of @entity160 , a journey that could take six months , mission controllers plan to send it out on a shorter jaunt to a spot 1,600 feet from its landing site			2
the deck of the @entity0 from the rover 's navigation camera			1
the back of the rover can be seen at the top left of the image , and two of the rover 's right side wheels can be seen on the left video : see @entity0 on the red planet as it prepares for target practice ...			1

engineers are running a series of tests before the vehicle 's first drive in the next couple of days
earlier @entity0 flexed its seven foot robotic arm containing an array of scientific equipment
