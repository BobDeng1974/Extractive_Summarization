a newlywed couple gave up their honeymoon to make their second appearance on the @entity5 show the day after their wedding - after the bride was accused of cheating			1
@entity9 and @entity10 got engaged after a whirlwind romance and a proposal over @entity13 , but their nuptials looked set to be cancelled after she accused him of cheating on her at a party			1
mr @entity10 , 29 , agreed to appear on @entity5 to take a lie detector test - which he failed			1
but mrs @entity19 forgave him and the marriage went ahead regardless			2
so the day after their wedding , the couple decided to delay their honeymoon and instead appear on the @entity36 show again to take their second lie detector test			1
thankfully , mrs @entity19 , 22 , passed the test and proved she had not cheated on her husband			1
she said : ' it was n't ideal			0
like most brides i wanted to be enjoying married life with my hubby but felt we could n't move on properly until i 'd proven i had n't cheated			0
' the day after our wedding should have been one of the best days of my life , but instead we spent it on the show being grilled by @entity5			2
' i did n't want to go back on the show but i needed to put @entity10 's mind at rest so we could both move on with our life and put the past behind us			2
mrs @entity19 accused her fiance of cheating on her at a party and took him to the @entity5 show , pictured , to find out the truth mr @entity10 , 29 , agreed to take a lie detector test on the @entity36 daytime show - which he failed			1
but mrs @entity19 forgave him and the wedding went ahead regardless ' we put our honeymoon on hold and went to @entity66 two weeks later			1
today , we 're happier than ever			0
' the couple met while on holiday in 2013 but mr @entity10 was already in a relationship			2
the pair had a long distance relationship - he lived in @entity72 and she lives in @entity74 , @entity75 - until mr @entity10 popped the question over @entity13 on christmas eve 2013			2
mrs @entity19 recalled : ' there was an instant attraction but @entity10 was in a relationship			1
' i did n't want to be a home - wrecker and it was important to me we started on a clean slate and his relationship was over before we started one			0
' [ when he proposed ] i was over the moon			0
i could n't believe it when he got down on one knee over @entity13 and asked me to marry him			0
however , rumours soon emerged that she had also been unfaithful - so the couple took the bizarre decision to delay their honeymoon and instead appear on the show to take their second lie detector test luckily mrs @entity19 ( pictured on her second @entity5 appearance - during her honeymoon ) passed the test ' it was so romantic and i said yes straightaway			1
all my family were in the room cheering			0
like me , they were really pleased too and thought @entity10 was a good egg			0
' even though we had n't been together that long , they knew how much i loved him			0
i could n't wait to start planning the wedding			0
' but her happiness was short - lived when she got a @entity111 message from her new fianc√© 's ex saying he had cheated on her at a @entity114 , just days after the proposal			0
though @entity10 denied the rumours , the messages continued , so @entity9 applied for a lie detector test on the @entity5 show in march 2014			1
the results revealed that unemployed @entity10 had in fact been unfaithful and was guilty of kissing and groping his ex-girlfriend			0
in spite of the results , @entity9 decided to stand by her man and they tied the knot just one month later , in april 2014			0
mrs @entity19 passed the test - proving that she had not been unfaithful - and the couple , pictured signing the marriage register , say the show helped to solve their problems once and for all however in the days leading up to the ceremony , @entity10 received a number of @entity111 messages messages claiming @entity9 had been cheating			1
the ceremony went ahead as planned , but while @entity9 was having her make - up done she received a call from a @entity5 researcher who asked how the relationship was going			2
she explained the cheating rumours and they were offered a lie detector test the next day , which they accepted			1
the pair drove back to @entity72 the following day , cancelling their planned honeymoon in @entity66 , where @entity9 took a lie detector test			1
the results revealed @entity9 , who has a five - year - old daughter from a previous relationship , was found to be faithful			2
