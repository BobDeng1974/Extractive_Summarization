@entity1 ’s 5 - 3 victory over @entity2 may have been the high point of their @entity4 season so far , but @entity5 insists he has tried hard to forget all about it			1
the @entity1 manager has not wanted his players to dwell on that stunning victory , rescued after falling 3 - 1 behind , which saw a winless run of 13 games follow subsequently			1
that prompted questions about the adverse effect of winning in such style and @entity5 would rather the match was never mentioned			1
@entity1 striker @entity18 celebrates after clinching victory against @entity2 it was a day to forget for @entity2 boss @entity21 after they conceded five goals at the @entity24 ‘ we ’ve been trying to forget about it ever since , ’ he said			1
‘ it was great but until we won at @entity30 that was the last time we won			2
‘ i think the best thing for us to do is concentrate on what we are doing at the moment			2
i do n’t know if it has affected anything			2
it obviously has as the question has been asked			0
‘ the game at our place was a very good result for us , we had a very good second half and scored at vital times			0
but those are not sort of events that happen every week			0
i do n’t spend much time looking at those angles			0
’ @entity46 fired @entity1 level as the @entity48 went on to run out 5 - 3 winners @entity50 changed his 4 - 4 - 2 diamond system in the weeks after the 5 - 3 to a more defensively sound 3 - 5 - 2 formation			1
united fans have chanted for a switch back but last week the @entity56 manager claimed 4 - 4 - 2 lacked balance and gives him a ‘ twitchy a * * ’			1
he highlighted that crazy afternoon at the @entity59 as his root cause for his concern			1
@entity5 believes @entity2 present awesome opposition whichever way they shape up – but did indicate @entity50 might have risked his job had he failed to pick up results while toying with tactics			1
@entity2 have lost once in 14 games			2
@entity5 briefs his players ahead of saturday 's trip to @entity71 ‘ i ’m expecting to play against a very good team , ’ said @entity5			2
‘ i would hope that whoever we play have a healthy respect for us			0
‘ i ’ve never been in any doubt their manager will play the way he wants to			0
but it may be a situation where he gets all his players in before he can totally play the way he wants			0
‘ but his track record as a manager is outstanding and he ’s proved many times over the years he is capable of building sides			0
‘ i can only speak from my own experience but you have to get enough results while you ’re going through the building process to keep people on side or keep your job			0
