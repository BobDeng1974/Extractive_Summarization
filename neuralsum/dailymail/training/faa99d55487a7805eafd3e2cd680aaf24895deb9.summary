he is the multi-millionaire who could n’t get anyone at @entity2 to answer his calls			1
the ambitious bidder who tried , in vain , to block the cut - price sale of @entity7 to mighty @entity8			1
a man with a track record in running an elite sports team within budget , @entity9 found two attempts to gain control at financially - ruined and forever - endangered @entity2 thwarted by those clinging to power — and by rival - shareholder blocks who would rather do things their own way			1
will he be back with a third offer ? well , for a man apparently ruling out a return to the fray , @entity9 sounded just a little too upbeat and positive as he took to the airwaves on monday night			1
even as he was delivering some pretty damning criticism of the current @entity29 regime			1
@entity30 businessman @entity9 made two offers for @entity2 but his calls to the club 's board were ignored the managing partner of the @entity38 @entity37 franchise had clearly invested some degree of thought in how his financial might and major - league expertise could benefit an ailing @entity44 club with a huge potential fan base			1
that all his optimism and obvious ability to fund a @entity2 renaissance should apparently be ignored by the current regime is almost beyond belief			1
yet @entity9 insisted : ‘ i really never could get them to engage meaningfully in any discussion			1
‘ at the end of the day , i guess that ’s why i formally withdrew my bid — because i could n’t get them to the table			1
i never received a counter-offer or any discussion of substance			1
‘ i knew their issues were short - term funding and that they did n’t want to dilute the current shareholders			1
‘ but those two things are really hard to do at the same time because the club , as most people know , needs funding			1
‘ listen , there are no guarantees of success in sport			1
all you can do is put your best foot forward , make sure your club is capitalised properly and put the best coaching staff in place to make the best decisions — give it your best shot			1
‘ that ’s what i was prepared to do			1
@entity9 attempted to block the cut - price sale of @entity7 to championship side @entity8 ‘ my plan was to kind of permanently capitalise the club over the next two to three years — so it had the best chances of being successful and getting back to being one of the top two teams in the @entity89 league			1
’ when any businessman talks about being willing to ‘ capitalise ’ a company , what he means is invest money in pursuit of growth			1
that was clearly on the agenda of a man who firmly believed the relative stability of his basketball team could be emulated at @entity29			1
‘ definitely , ’ he said , adding : ‘ the thing about these sports clubs is you may own them — but they really belong to the community			1
so you are really more of a custodian			1
‘ and it ’s all about winning			1
that ’s the only reason you get involved in professional sport			1
‘ i ’m a professional guy , my stock trades on the @entity113			2
the banking company and the @entity38 records are in the paper every day			2
‘ so it ’s full transparency — and all about winning , creating sustained success			2
’ the current @entity2 board remain in negotiations with the @entity124 consortium , while former director @entity126 ’s recent acquisition of a large stake in the club further complicates matters			1
@entity2 went into administration in february 2012 and were later relegated to the @entity131 meanwhile , the club do not have the cash to pay off a manager serving his notice , never mind start recruiting for a head coach capable of steering them to promotion			1
and few would be shocked if more talent was sold off before the month is out			2
@entity9 insisted that both of his offers would have allowed many of those putting together their own bids to remain part of the project			1
he also revealed that his initial £ 18million package had one very interesting condition attached			2
‘ as part of the condition of that first offer , i had it in there that they could n’t sell any players , ’ he said			2
‘ the day after i submitted the offer , they sold one of the more promising young players ( @entity7 )			1
so that deal was kind of crushed			2
‘ my second offer was intended to provide more flexibility			2
so what i intended to do was loan £ 6.5m for the short - term cash flow issues , then give the board the discretion to sell me between £ 16m and £ 20m of equity as they saw fit			1
‘ so they could minimise the dilution if they wanted or they could sell me more shares and put more money in the club			2
‘ the £ 6.5m was a loan			2
that would have been repaid through the share issue			2
the new capital going into the club would have been between £ 16m and £ 20m — and then the additional money that i would offer to pay to buy out any shareholders			2
‘ but my hope was that most of them would stay in			2
under the law of the @entity186 , you have to make that offer to all the shareholders			2
’ asked outright if he would be back with a third bid , the 52 - year - old said : ‘ i have to be careful with all these securities rules you guys have other there			0
‘ it ’s hard to do somewhat of a hostile deal from 5,000 miles away			0
it ’s really not my style			0
‘ i was just really trying to be helpful to the club and the fans , and say : “ hey , i ’ll bring in a bunch of capital			0
and we do have some pretty good expertise here at the @entity38 ”			0
‘ there are a lot of areas i thought we could help in			0
our strength and conditioning , our experience with fan engagement and interaction , our analytics group and things like that			0
and let ’s combine that with a world - class coach , manager , and executive , and let ’s give the team the best possible chance			0
‘ that was really , simply , my goal			0
’ as part of his £ 20m offer , @entity9 was willing to hand @entity2 an emergency £ 6.5m loan @entity9 again insisted he had n’t been acting as a front for other investors unwilling to show their faces , admitting : ‘ to be honest , i understand the concerns of the fans because of all the trials and tribulations the club has been through			1
so they have every right to be sceptical			0
‘ but everyone kind of over-read my interest			0
it was really , really simple			0
it was just my family looking to make an investment in soccer			0
‘ we had hired a firm and we were going down the path of looking for an investment in either @entity254 or @entity255			0
at the time , while some of that information was sitting on our coffee table , my kids ’ soccer coach , @entity249 , was looking at it and said : “ hey , you ’ve got to look at this team i played for			0
the timing is great : they really need the money , they really need some help			0
you ought to look at it ”			0
‘ the more i looked at it , the more i liked it			0
it is as simple as that			0
there was no other story			0
‘ i had never met anybody , who had ever had anything to do with the club			0
‘ i ’m a believer in the idea that basketball and soccer are two great long - term investments			0
‘ because they ’re the only two major sports played internationally , wherever you go , and they ’re both played by men and women			0
‘ so soccer has been of interest for some while			0
it ’s the sport of choice for my three sons			0
that ’s why my interest was piqued			0
’ he sounds like a man still interested in the game			0
still able to put some struggling club back on a sound footing			0
if only someone would take his call .			0
