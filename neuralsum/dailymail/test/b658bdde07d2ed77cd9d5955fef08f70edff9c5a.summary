@entity1 human rights judges have delivered a boost to home secretary @entity4 ’s campaign to kick illegal immigrants and foreign criminals out of the country			1
in a landmark ruling , they undermined the idea that no foreigner should be thrown out of a country if it will interfere with their right to a family life			0
eight judges of the @entity16 found that @entity17 was justified in deporting a 45 - year - old man for breaking immigration laws even though he went to live there more than 20 years ago and has a @entity17 wife and son			1
but the @entity34 court said that the @entity17 authorities had not breached any human rights rules when they deported him in 2011			1
it follows years of @entity40 frustration over the ease with which illegal immigrants and foreign criminals can dodge deportation or delay it for years by claiming that it would breach their right to a family life under the @entity48			2
a number of the 760 foreign criminals on the run in @entity52 have used the clause to block their deportation , and @entity52 judges have repeatedly upheld even the most spurious claim to a family life			0
mps voted for new guidelines in 2012 which said that any foreign criminal sentenced to more than four years in jail should not be able to plead family rights as a reason to stay in @entity52			0
mrs may has also introduced a system under which foreign criminals are deported and only then allowed to appeal to the courts against removal			0
she has promised the system will be extended to illegal immigrants if the @entity72 win the election			0
boost : mrs may is hoping to be able to stop illegal immigrants and foreign criminals dodging deportation or delaying it by claiming their right to a family life the @entity1 judges – whose rulings are supposed to be followed by 47 countries including @entity17 – heard that @entity81 - born @entity29 had gone to @entity17 in 1992 , had married in the city of @entity83 in 1994 and had a son in 1995			1
however , he failed to keep his permits up to date			0
@entity29 told the judges that his son needed a father , that his wife needed his financial support to pay back a property loan , and that his family had no links to @entity81			2
lawyers for @entity17 argued that it was necessary to deport him to ensure immigration laws were obeyed			1
the @entity34 ruling said that by breaking immigration rules @entity29 had ‘ demonstrated consistent disregard of the laws , regulations and public order of the host country ’			1
it added that he had been deported to @entity17 - speaking @entity106 .			2

@entity16 find @entity17 justified in deporting father
@entity29 had committed no crime worse than traffic violations
but was deported for breaking immigration laws after 20 years residence
eight judges rule @entity17 did not breach the 45 - year - old 's human rights
