@entity34 told the @entity35 : ' i think everyone should shut the f * * * up			1
' if you did n't like the lyrics you should n't have agreed to sing the song			2
' i think it 's smug of @entity10 to say it 's smug			2
' she added that there is a common impression that performers have not donated any of their own money to the cause , something she calls an ' assumption '			0
miss @entity11 , who was one of only three black musicians to take part in the new single , praised the sentiment behind the project but said ‘ a whole new ’ song was needed			1

she added : ‘ i apologise if the lyrics of the song have caused offence			2
i wish the changes had been kept but that is out of my control			0
’ @entity10 also said yesterday she refused to take part in the project because she felt there was ‘ something smug about it ’			0
she added : ‘ i prefer to do my charitable bit by donating actual money and not being lumped in with a bunch of people like that			0
’ @entity84 frontman @entity83 also appeared to criticise the project , saying ‘ really sometimes , giving money creates another problem ’			0
he added : ‘ our perspective and our idea of what helps and our idea [ of ] what ’s wrong and right are not necessarily shared by other cultures			0

critics said it was inappropriate to use the same song – brought to public attention once more by its original creators , sir @entity109 and @entity133 – for a different crisis			1
it has also been pointed out that many of those affected by ebola are @entity139 and do not celebrate @entity140			0

sir @entity109 , 63 , ( pictured with @entity133 ) has called claims the song is patronising a ‘ complete load of b * * * * * * * ’ ‘ there ’s a danger that this kind of appeal is slightly patronising and gives the impression that @entity8 does n’t have the capacity to do things for itself			1
’ @entity168 , co-founder of @entity24 in the @entity169 and the @entity171 initiative on ebola , told @entity173 the original song ‘ created misconceptions about @entity127 in a patronising way ’			1
and @entity177 , 26 , a financial analyst from @entity127 , joked : ‘ i would ask , does @entity109 know when it ’s @entity140 time in @entity127 ? ‘ perhaps the fact that we celebrate @entity140 a few weeks later on january 7 could have misled him into thinking we do n’t know when it is			0
‘ reassure him from us that , after his last three reminders , we are well aware and do n’t need any more prompting			0
’ despite the backlash , the single has sold 312,000 copies since its release last week			0
