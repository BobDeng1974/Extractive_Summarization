a bizarre argument is raging around the imperilled @entity2 team @entity1 — is their only director , @entity4 , a @entity6 cleaner or a former @entity8 footballer ? @entity4 was thrown into the limelight on thursday after @entity1 ’s 220 staff were locked out of the factory in @entity12 , @entity13 , their futures uncertain			1
the story is based on a row between @entity19 owner @entity18 and @entity20 , a consortium led by former @entity23 team principal @entity22 that seemed to have bought the team from @entity18 in june			1
an unidentified man collects his belongings from the @entity1 factory in @entity12 , @entity13 @entity1 have been in financial difficulty and administrators have reportedly locked staff out of the building in a series of claims and counter-claims over the past 48 hours , @entity31 said @entity18 had failed to hand over his shares			1
@entity18 retorted by saying : ‘ there was no legal obligation to transfer the shares to them unless certain conditions — which included paying creditors — were met			1
' those conditions have not been met			2
our lawyers have asked @entity45 several times to comply with these conditions but they have failed to engage			0
’ in the same press release , @entity46 , the chief executive of @entity18 ’ company , said : ‘ i question how anyone who was interested in the future of the business would appoint one of their cleaners — @entity4 — as the sole director and shareholder of the @entity58 operating company ? ’ it casts more doubt on whether @entity1 will be involved at the @entity62 @entity61 next weekend the administrators , @entity64 and @entity65 , confirmed that @entity4 is a director			1
but @entity66 said they ‘ did not appoint mr @entity4 who , we believe , was a former top footballer for @entity8 during the 1980s			0
’ @entity4 did indeed score two goals in eight appearances while on loan at @entity8 in the 1987 - 88 season , and also oversaw the cleaning of the @entity1 factory , which is said to smell of dead rodents			2
@entity31 said in a statement on thursday night : ‘ every single condition precedent of the sales and purchase agreement for which @entity31 was responsible has been met			0
’ @entity81 , @entity2 ’s supremo , is trying to bring the sides together , with @entity1 struggling to get their cars to @entity85 , @entity86 for the next @entity2 race on sunday week			2
@entity18 implied on @entity88 that he has not been paid by the consortium that bought @entity1 from him @entity1 's cars are 48 hours away from the scheduled flight to @entity62 for the next @entity61 @entity18 relinquished control of @entity1 to the consortium at the end of june this year @entity95 has ‘ made progress ’ according to a doctor who treated him after his ski accident last december			1
@entity95 was operated on and placed into a coma to reduce the swelling			0
@entity100 said : ‘ i have noted some progress			0
we are on a timescale which goes to three years and we need to be patient			0

administrators reportedly locked out staff as ownership row *continues*
@entity18 claims he has not been paid by consortium taking over
