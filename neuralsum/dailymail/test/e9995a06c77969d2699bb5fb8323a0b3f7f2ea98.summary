getting the best price for your unwanted wares online can seem like a fine art , but researchers have found a simple trick that could see your bids soar			0
economists plotted how much goods listed on @entity9 sold for and discovered that items with precise prices attract higher offers than those with round numbers , such as $ 1,000			1
in fact , sellers who end their price with ‘ 00 ’ typically receive offers that are five to eight per cent lower than those with more specific prices			1
@entity22 researchers claim that exact prices of goods on @entity9 attract higher offers than round numbers			1
this chart shows that when the posted initial price is of a round number ( the red dots ) , like $ 1,000 , the average counteroffer is much lower than if it is a non-round number ( the blue circles ) , like $ 1,079 in terms of the study , the word ' odd ' is used to represent an unusual number , and not the opposite of even			1
competitive options for buyers and sellers can define a limit beyond which they will not go , but there is still a range of prices that fall within those limits , professor of strategic management at @entity47 , @entity48 , writes for @entity49			2
within that range , sellers are looking for a higher price while buyers would like a lower one , so each has an incentive to signal to the other their willingness to be a tough negotiator			1
sometimes , however , sellers may want to send a signal they are willing to be less tough , such as when they are keen to sell an item quickly			2
one method is to lower their starting price , but this is n’t always desirable			0
sellers on @entity9 who end their price with ‘ 00 ’ typically receive offers for their goods that are five to eight per cent lower than those with more specific prices , such as this watch example while @entity9 is used for auctions , the bulk of its business comes from ' buy it now ' sales , such as this @entity77			1
the study found that prices that end in ' 00 ' as above are more likely to sell quickly , but may not attract the most lucrative counter offers from sellers researchers from @entity83 , @entity84 and the @entity85 , have addressed the problem in a new paper			1
researchers from @entity83 , @entity84 and the @entity85 looked at pricing strategies within the confines of @entity9 ’s so - called ' negotiation platform '			1
most trades on the site are listed for a ‘ buy it now ’ price and the seller can give buyers the option of making them an alternative offer			0
for example , a seller of an @entity77 may list a price of $ 1,000 ( £ 660 ) , and someone might come back with a counteroffer of $ 800 ( £ 530 )			0
this could go on for about three rounds , in line with @entity9 rules , and could last up to a week			0
the study found that when the initial price is a round number , such as $ 1,000 , the average counteroffer is between five and eight per cent lower than if it is a non-round number , like $ 1,079			1
in fact , the economists said sellers can even end up with a higher counteroffer if they list at $ 997 rather than $ 1,000			1
but sellers with round numbers are more likely to close a deal six to 11 days sooner , and are up to 5 per cent more likely to sell at all			1
@entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 looked at this issue within the confines of @entity9 ’s so - called ' negotiation platform '			0
while some people associate @entity9 with auctions rather than straightforward sales , this has n’t been @entity9 ’s main business for about a decade			0
instead , most trades are listed for a ‘ buy it now ’ price and the seller can give buyers the option of making them an alternative offer			0
for example , a seller of an @entity77 may list a price of $ 1,000 ( £ 660 ) , and someone might come back with a counteroffer of $ 800 ( £ 530 ) , to which the seller could then accept or make a new offer			0
this could go on for about three rounds , in line with @entity9 rules , and could last up to a week			0
but the study shows that when the initial price is a round number , such as $ 1,000 , the average counteroffer is between five and eight per cent lower than if it is a non-round number , like $ 1,079			2
in fact , the economists said sellers can even end up with a higher counteroffer if they list at $ 997 rather than $ 1,000			2
‘ in other words , you are better off initially asking for a lower price if price was all you cared about , ’ professor @entity48 writes			2
the researchers believe that what is going on here is ‘ cheap talk ’ - an easy - to - make statement that may be true or untrue with no consequences for dishonesty - and not an otherwise reliable signal			2
there are some sellers who do n’t just care about price and , absent any other way of signalling that to buyers , they set their price at a round number			0
the researchers applied their findings to house sales and discovered that people looking to sell their house quickly should pick a round number , but if they 're willing to wait , an odd one is more likely to get a good price while the study is new , professor @entity48 said the technique to sell houses ( a stock image is shown ) as quickly as possible , or for as much money as possible , is already used by estate agents alternatively more patient sellers may be using non-round numbers to signal their toughness			1
either way , the last two digits of the price is ' cheap talk '			0
but sellers with round numbers are more likely to close a deal six to 11 days sooner , and are up to 5 per cent more likely to sell at all			1
this is interesting because the last two digits of a price make little difference to the price , professor @entity48 notes			0
the authors wanted to see if their analysis would work in other markets and whether they could guess what the cheap talk prices would be			0
they found was that while the effect they observed did n’t happen for all other prices , it did arise for prices that ended in 99 cents			0
prices ending in 99 cents , or 99 pence , are very common in shops and send out the same type of signal as the ‘ 00 ’ prices , they said			1
the researchers also discovered that people looking to sell their house quickly should pick a round number , but if they are willing to wait , an odd one is more likely to get a good price – a trick estate agents already use .			2

researchers claim using exact prices when selling goods on @entity9 attract higher offers than round numbers
sellers who end prices with ‘ 00 ’ typically receive offers up to 8 *%* lower
however , goods with round numbers typically sell faster , the study claims
