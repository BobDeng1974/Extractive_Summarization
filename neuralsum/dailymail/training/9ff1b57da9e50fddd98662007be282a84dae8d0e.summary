by the time people wake up tomorrow morning it will be clear whether @entity2 is to become an independent country or remain in the @entity4			1
@entity2 ’s chief counting officer @entity5 is pencilled in to announce the historic result at 7am from the @entity7 in @entity8 outside @entity9			1
hints of what the outcome is likely to be will drip in through the night as @entity2 ’s towns and cities release their results			1
@entity37 is working with the pilot of a chartered plane which is waiting in @entity40 to fly to @entity41 to take ballot boxes from the southern half of the @entity34			1
discussions are ongoing over when to make a final decision to abort the flight and call - in a fishing boat to transport the ballot boxes by sea			0
however , the contingency plan to get a shellfish boat to carry the ballot boxes may also be hindered if the sea route is also affected by the heavy mist			0
despite that , the first results will be announced at 2am with the key areas of @entity26 and @entity25 ones to watch			1
both are fertile ground for the ‘ @entity61 ’ campaign and @entity24 will be desperate for a strong show of support for independence			0
the two central belt local authorities are relatively poor with few voters born outside @entity2			2
a strong ‘ yes ’ showing in @entity26 and @entity25 will give an early sign that @entity2 ’s future in the @entity70 really is hanging by a thread			1
working class @entity2 – and in particular , middle aged men in deprived towns – have moved strongly into mr @entity24 ’s ‘ yes ’ camp			2
but if the no campaign manages a good turnout , @entity79 and @entity80 will be able to breathe a sigh of relief that the result is shifting their way			0
the next counts to watch for are @entity27 and @entity28 , and @entity30 – which are both being called at 3am			0
dumfries and @entity28 is a rare @entity89 strong hold in @entity2 which is heavily unionist			2
the ‘ no ’ campaign needs a strong showing on a good turnout to keep any momentum it may have gained earlier in the night			0
but if the nationalists manage a good showing in this ‘ no ’ heartland it will point to problems for the @entity70			0
@entity30 is the next big hope for the @entity61 campaign , with mr @entity24 needing a strong showing here before @entity2 ’s big cities take their turn to announce			1
the @entity70 flag , held aloft over @entity9 last night , may fly in @entity2 for the last time if the ' yes ' campaign mobilises its working class supporters today @entity22 and @entity9 are both scheduled to declare at 5am – and with 860,000 voters between them account for one in five @entity2			1
both cities are expected to reject independence – but stronger than expected support for independence could tip the referendum to mr @entity24			2
in recent polls the ‘ no ’ campaign had a 12 per cent lead in @entity22			0
if this ends up being right , the @entity61 campaign will have needed to build up a big lead beforehand – or hope for a miracle afterwards .			0

today 's historic referendum result could be announced by 7am tomorrow
but @entity2 's future likely to be clear before @entity31 declares at 6am
5am results from @entity2 's biggest cities , @entity22 and @entity9 , are key
but tonight it emerged that fog in the @entity34 could disrupt the count
