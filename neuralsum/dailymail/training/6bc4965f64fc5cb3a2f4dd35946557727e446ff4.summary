a war is being waged in a @entity2 town over the word @entity3			1
a rift first appeared in the town of @entity6 earlier this year when the schools voted to change the name of @entity3 vacation to ' holiday break			1
' on saturday , that rift deepened when the @entity12 was asked to take down a flashing roadside sign that read ' @entity3 to all			1
' townspeople in @entity6 , @entity2 defiantly took to the streets in holiday garb saturday to wave handmade signs proclaiming ' @entity3 ' to passersby after city officials forced the removal of a roadside sign that read ' @entity3 to all - in @entity16 we trust ' war on @entity3 : the local @entity12 union posted the sign and said it was merely an innocent gesture a group soon took to the streets while decked out in holiday garb and elf costumes where they waved ' @entity3 ' signs and wished passersby a happy holiday			1
the sign was placed there by public works employee and local union chairman @entity41 , who called the sign ' perfectly innocent			0
' ' we ’re the guys who take care of the town , and we ’re proud of it , ' @entity41 told the @entity49			0

' in november , a special meeting of the @entity6 was held to address the change of their winter break name from @entity3 vacation to holiday break			1
too politically correct ? the protesters say a war is being waged on @entity3 in their town and point to a recent school board vote to change the name of @entity3 vacation to holiday break to prove it ' this is @entity64 , right ? ' : residents of the town of 24,000 who want to bring the word @entity3 back , like @entity72 , say their rights are being taken away			1
' it 's up to the individual , ' @entity72 said even when nearly a fifth of the city 's 24,000 residents signed a petition asking that the name be changed back , the board voted the request down			2
@entity109 , who presented the 4,000 - plus signatures to the committee , told @entity66 : ' some people have other holy days on their calendars because that ’s their community and what they believe ... but our community is @entity119 , and we should be able to hold on to those traditions			0
