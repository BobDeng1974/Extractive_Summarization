@entity0 gambled by resting seven of the team - including @entity3 and @entity4 - that lost to @entity6 on the weekend			2
despite this @entity7 pushed the @entity9 champions all the way and the two teams were only separated by a @entity13 first - half effort			1
here , @entity15 's @entity14 gives his verdict on how the players performed at the @entity18 on tuesday			2
@entity13 celebrates opening the scoring for @entity20 against @entity7 on tuesday @entity20 ( 4 - 2 - 2 - 2 ) @entity21 - 6 a veteran of these occasions , his biggest issue was staying warm on a freezing night			1
@entity25 - 7 no surprises from the former @entity7 man ; got through his work quietly and efficiently			1
@entity29 - 6.5 did n’t need to engage his top gear to keep @entity31 at arms length			2
@entity29 ( left ) goes shoulder to shoulder with @entity34 @entity35 - 6.5 back to fitness			2
largely untroubled but booked for one rash tackle on @entity38			0
@entity39 - 8 magnificent cross created the opening goal for @entity13 ; never under threat defensively			0
@entity43 - 7.5 a player who makes the game at the highest level look easy			1
@entity47 had time and space			0
@entity50 - 7 never wasted a pass but , then again , was never put under extreme pressure			1
@entity50 ( right ) shields the ball away from the onrushing @entity54 @entity55 - 7 not even first choice when @entity57 is fit			2
keeps play effortlessly ticking over			0
@entity59 - 7 in any other team , he would be the superstar			0
was n’t as impressive as he was at @entity61 though			0
@entity62 - 6.5 skirted around the edges of the game apart from a couple of shots			1
not the night for a record breaker			0
@entity62 has a shot at goal but the @entity71 superstar had a quiet night by his high standards @entity13 - 8.5 the best out - and - out striker in world football at present ; took his goal clinically			1
subs @entity77 ( for @entity78 , 83 mins ) @entity57 7 ( for @entity59 , 62 ) @entity79 ( for @entity13 , 87 ) @entity7 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity80 - 7.5 has n’t been in good form but grew in confidence after making two excellent saves early on			1
@entity80 ( centre ) rises to catch the ball to deny @entity62 a header on goal @entity88 - 7 not a player who makes headlines but he defends very well and stuck to his task against @entity39			1
@entity92 - 6.5 got into a muddle early on , never given a moment ’s piece by the relentless @entity13			0
@entity96 - 8 gets criticised but this was quite possibly his best game in a @entity7 shirt			1
ca n’t lose his place after this			0
@entity96 ( left ) was a surprise starter but put in a composed performance at the back for @entity7 @entity106 - 7.5 @entity7 ’s best summer signing continues to make a positive impression ; lots of energy , looks a proper player			1
@entity54 - 7 @entity112 in the middle , made his tackles and used the ball simply when he had it			0
@entity116 - 6 yet to show why @entity7 were so delighted to complete his signing			2
@entity38 - 7 took time to get into the game but impressed in the second half and came closest to scoring			2
@entity38 ( right ) grew into the game the longer it went on @entity125 - 7 @entity126 @entity62 early on with a good tackle and got better from there , a terrier scampering after possession			1
@entity34 - 5 things just are n’t working for the £ 20m winger , failed to make any kind of impact			0
@entity31 - 6.5 work ethic not in question but given no service so could n’t test @entity21			0
@entity31 ( left ) started up front ahead of @entity139 and @entity140 but failed to impress subs @entity142 6 ( for can , 75mins ) @entity3 6 ( for @entity54 , 69 ) sterling 6 ( for @entity34 , 69 ) video we did n't need to play with intensity - @entity144			0

@entity20 beat @entity7 1 - 0 at the @entity18 in the @entity146
@entity62 had a quiet night by his high standards
*midfielder* duo of @entity43 and @entity50 control game for @entity20
@entity96 was surprise starter at centre back but played well
