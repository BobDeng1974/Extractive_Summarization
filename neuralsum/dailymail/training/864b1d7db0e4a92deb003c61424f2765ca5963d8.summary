by @entity0 published : 04:11 est , 12 june 2012 updated : 09:44 est , 12 june 2012 it 's no secret that @entity2 is a beaten and battered planet - astronomers have been peering for centuries at the violent impact craters created by cosmic buckshot pounding its surface over billions of years			1
but just how beat up is it ? really beat up , according to a @entity10 research team that recently finished counting , outlining and cataloging a staggering 635,000 impact craters on @entity2 that are roughly a kilometer or more in diameter			2
the new crater atlas also should help researchers better understand the history of water volcanism on @entity2 through time , as well as the planet 's potential for past habitability by primitive life , he said			1
' this database is a giant tool that will be helpful in scores of future @entity2 studies ranging from age - dating and erosion to planetary habitability and to other applications we have not even thought of yet , ' said @entity31 , who is affiliated with @entity10 's @entity50			1
' in a sense it 's like building a new and better hammer , which quickly becomes used by everyone			0
' we have all this new information coming from @entity2 orbiters and landers that have helped generate far better maps illustrating the planet 's topography and surface details			2
i basically analyzed maps and drew crater rim circles for four years			0
' one crater in particular reveals dark traces of sediment thought to have been cemented together by water from an ancient groundwater reservoir , before being carved away by howling @entity2 wind co-author @entity71 , a @entity50 research associate and assistant professor in the geological sciences department , said knowing more about the history and extent of @entity2 cratering has implications for better understanding the potential for past life on @entity2			1
he said : ' many of the large impact craters generated hydrothermal systems that could have created unique , locally habitable environments that lasted for thousands or millions of years , assuming there was water in the planet 's crust at the time			2
' but large impacts also have the ability to wipe out life forms , as evident from @entity95 's dinosaur - killing @entity94 impact 65 million years ago			1
' while there are only about 150 to 200 known impact craters left on @entity95 , both the moon and @entity100 are still peppered with craters due to their lack of atmosphere and plate tectonic activity , he said			0
cataloging the cratering of @entity2 and the moon is helping scientists understand a time a few hundred million years after the inner solar system formed , including an event about 3.9 billion years ago known as the ' @entity109 ' in which asteroids as large as @entity111 rained down on @entity95			1
' although @entity95 has lost most of its geologic record due to tectonic plate movements and erosion , understanding the impact crater history on the moon and @entity2 can help us reconstruct our early days , ' said @entity71			1
the asteroids litter the landscape - as they would on @entity95 except we have a geologically active world @entity31 said most of the smaller diameter craters on @entity2 are younger than the largest craters and form the bulk of the planet 's crater population			1
' the basic idea of age dating is that if a portion of the planet 's surface has more craters , it has been around longer , ' said @entity31			0
much of the planet has been ' resurfaced ' by volcanic and erosional activity , essentially erasing older geological features , including craters			0
the new database also is expected to help planetary scientists better understand erosion on the planet , said @entity31 , who earned his doctoral degree from @entity10 's astrophysical and planetary sciences department			0
' our crater database contains both rim heights and crater depths , which can help us differentiate between craters that have been filled in versus those that have eroded by different processes over time , giving us a better idea about long - term changes on the planet 's surface			0
' having a better handle on the size and distribution of @entity2 impact craters also has implications for future , manned missions to the planet , said @entity71			2
@entity160 wants to know where the craters are and their particular features both from a safety and research standpoint			0
' craters act as a ' poor man 's drill ' that provide new information about the subsurface of @entity2 , ' he said			0
since the most complete databases of lunar craters include only those roughly 10 to 15 kilometers in diameter or larger , and databases on @entity100 's craters contain only those over roughly 20 kilometers in diameter , it is difficult to compare them with the @entity2 crater database , said @entity31			2

giant database will help plan future @entity2 landings , and reveal history of water on @entity2
will shed light on *3.9billion* years ago - when asteroids ' the size of @entity111 ' *smashed* into @entity95
