by @entity0 supermarket wines have once again proven that they are not to be sniffed at as own - brand bottles bag 360 medals at the @entity4			1
winners included a £ 5.25 @entity7 sherry and a £ 6 @entity9 sauvignon blanc as well as @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 's , @entity13 , and @entity14 all picking up gold awards			1
the @entity16 ( @entity4 ) assesses every wine ' blind ' and judges each for its faithfulness to style , region and vintage			1
good value : there 's no need to splash out on fancy wines after supermarket own brands win gold awards each award - winning wine is tasted on at least three separate occasions by a minimum of ten different judges , including @entity33			1
this year , the @entity16 hosted two tasting events for the first time , @entity36 1 in november 2013 and tranche 2 in april 2014 , to accommodate the different production and sales schedules across the industry , and give winemakers two opportunities to enter their wines - with the second round producing more supermarket winners than ever before			2
@entity10 held on to its superior status - being awarded the highest number of gold medals for six wines , continuing its 2013 success ( when it was named @entity51 )			1
surprisingly , sherry was instrumental in the high - end supermarket 's success , with two @entity56 varieties earning gold with both costing just £ 8			2
@entity58 at a slightly pricier £ 30 also took home a gold			0
the brand picked up a total of 50 silver medals and 82 bronze medals for its wine range			1
@entity10 's @entity56 wines both retailing at £ 8 were awarded gold medals if you 're not quite able to stretch to @entity10 bubbly prices , then @entity12 's and @entity13 are a happy compromise with both supermarkets delighting the judges with their great - value fizz and each receiving four gold awards			1
@entity12 's @entity78 the @entity77 ( £ 9.99 ) and @entity79 ( £ 19.99 ) both received gold medals			2
@entity13 proved to be @entity79 champion , with three gold medals , the @entity79 , the @entity83 ( £ 21.99 ) and the 2004 @entity84 ( £ 30.99 )			2
and @entity12 's received 17 silver and 38 bronze awards , while @entity13 was awarded seven silver and 11 bronze			1
@entity11 received gold medals for its @entity90 ( @entity91 ) and @entity92 ( r ) cheaper supermarket brands also highly impressed the judges with @entity11 taking home three gold medals for its dessert wines and @entity97 and @entity14 receiving equal applause , with three golds for its sweet and sherry wines			1
@entity7 continues its good reputation for high - quality at reasonable prices			0
the low - priced supermarket bagged a gold medal for its @entity106 , at only £ 5.25			0
@entity7 also received a gold for its @entity108 2012 as well as four silver winners and 13 bronze			2
@entity9 received a single gold for its @entity112 2012 from @entity113 , priced at £ 6			0
the supermarket also received five silver medals and 20 bronzes			2
finally , local supermarket brand , the co-operative was awarded five silver medals , and a total of 12 bronze for wines from its own - brand range			1
@entity124 , co-chairman of the @entity16 commented says he was astounded by the quality of the supermarket wines on offer and agrees they are worthy winners			2
the @entity16 says that the high quality of supermarket wine means we will no longer be embarrassed to take an own - brand bottle to a dinner party ' the calibre of wines from the supermarket own - brand ranges has been phenomenal this year , and it is great to see them picking up top prizes across all styles			1
from delicious @entity143 to tremendous @entity144 , shoppers can find some lovely wines in the aisles , ' he said			0
' each year the quality of the supermarket own - brand wines gets better and better			0
long gone are the days when you might be embarrassed to take an own - brand wine to a dinner party			0
our @entity16 medal stickers offer a handy guide to picking the best wines in the aisle			0
' @entity124 continued to say that the competition could n't be fairer , and that winning medals at the contest can give these supermarket brands a real boost			1
' @entity162 is committed to rigorous and fair tasting and has subsequently earned its reputation as the most well - respected wine competition in the world			0
by hosting two separate tasting events across the year , wines are given the best chance to perform well , wherever they 're from			0
