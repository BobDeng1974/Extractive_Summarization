by @entity0 from food to medical instruments , it seems that @entity4 can be used to create almost anything			2
and now a team of ambitious architects are using the additive manufacturing technique to build an entire house			0
they are using an industrial scale 3d printer called a room builder to engineer the plastic parts that will be fused together to create everything from walls to the furniture			1
@entity24 's futuristic building is described as an exhibition , research and a building site for @entity4 architecture , which connects the science , construction and design communities the house is the brainchild of @entity34 - based firm @entity24			1
it is being built by the side of a canal in the north of the city and will be the world 's first @entity4 printed house			1
the structure will have 13 rooms and is inspired by a traditional gable design			0
it is being printed by a giant 3d printer called @entity47 or the ' room builder '			1
the machine will pipe thick lines of molten plastic around 10 times as large as lines printed by ' home ' printers			1
construction has been under way for around one month			0
the interior and exterior of rooms can be printed in one part and there is space within the blocks for cables , pipes and wiring because of their honeycomb and lattice design			2
the ‘ world ’s first ’ 3d printed house , which is being built by a canal in north @entity34 in the @entity74 , will boast 13 rooms when it is finished and concrete will only be used to provide structural support - at least at the moment			1
@entity34 - based firm @entity24 ’s futuristic building is described as ' an exhibition , research and a building site for @entity82 ' , which connects the science , construction and design communities			2
the @entity86 is being printed using the @entity47 , which means room builder and pipes plastic lines of molten plastic on top of one another according to computerised plans – just like a gigantic version of a home 3d printer			1
the machine , which is made by @entity74 firm @entity97 , pipes lines around 10 times as large as a standard 3d printer and can create pieces of building that are 6ft wide , 6ft deep and 11ft tall ( 2metres by 2meters by 3.5metres )			1
the @entity47 machine pipes thick lines of molten plastic ( pictured ) that are around 10 times as thick as the lines drawn by ' home ' 3d printers the @entity86 is being printed using the @entity47 , which means ' room builder ' and pipes plastic lines on top of one another according to computerised plans - just like a gigantic version of a home @entity4 construction has been under way for around one month and so far a 9ft ( three metre ) high corner section has been printed , weighing 397lbs ( 180kg ) , according to @entity116			1
giant pieces like the corner will be used much like @entity120 bricks and stacked on top of one another to make the house , which is inspired by the traditional @entity74 gabled town houses			2
the design consists of a number of rooms – each with unique features - which will be designed separately on site , before being assembled into the house , so experts can test their safety			2
using computers to design and print the structure means that architects can create a house that has structural integrity , while also looking aesthetically pleasing so that the interior and exterior of rooms can be printed in one part			2
there is space within the plastic block walls for cables , pipes and wiring because of a honeycomb lattice design			0
the @entity47 machine ( pictured ) , which is made by @entity74 firm @entity97 , can create pieces of building that are 6ft wide , 6ft deep and 11ft tall ( 2metres by 2meters by 3.5metres ) here a small - scale 3d printer quickly makes small , scale sections of wall , the likes of which will be built for real by a giant printer the plastic used to print the house is ‘ a renewable , sustainable , strong , tactile and beautiful material that can compete with current building techniques , ’ according to the architects			1
scientists are currently testing different samples of materials to create the perfect one but the final ‘ hot melt ’ product will be approximately 80 per cent natural as it is a bioplastic mix made up of microfibres and plant oil			0
@entity171 from the architect firm said : ‘ we ’re still perfecting the technology			0
we will continue to test over the next three years , as the technology evolves … it ’s an experiment			0
’ at the moment , the lattice blocks are being filled with less sustainable concrete , which would make the structure , hard to recycle , but this seems to be an intermediary step			0
using computers to design the house means that architects can create a house that has structural integrity , while also looking aesthetically pleasing so that the interior and exterior of rooms can be printed in one part			0
here are some small examples of different types of walls , and the honeycomb cavities are easily visible the plastic used to print the house ( pictured ) is ‘ a renewable , sustainable , strong , tactile and beautiful material that can compete with current building techniques , ’ according to the architects if the house is a success and the technology honed , the architects hope that @entity4 could mark a new era in building houses			1
the cost of transporting materials and waste could be cut using the technique and the final buildings could be dismantled and moved in units , or completely recycled			0
mr @entity209 said : ' this could revolutionise how we make our cities			0
this is only the beginning , but there could be endless possibilities , from printing functional solutions locally in slums and disaster areas , to high - end hotel rooms that are individually customised and printed in marble dust			0
’ construction is under way on the @entity86 , pieces of which are being printed from piped plastic according to computerised plans ( illustrated ) - just like a gigantic version of a home @entity4			1

@entity24 is building the ‘ world ’s first ’ 3d printed house , which is located by a canal in north @entity34
an industrial scale 3d printer is being used to pipe plastic bricks that will be stacked on top of one another to construct the house
the ' room builder ' machine pipes plastic lines according to computerised plans – just like a gigantic version of a home @entity4
