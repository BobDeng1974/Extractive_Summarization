by @entity0 published : 10:08 est , 9 august 2012 updated : 08:01 est , 10 august 2012 a design researcher has developed a computer programme that makes predictions about what people will do next by monitoring their behaviour			1
@entity8 designer @entity7 created @entity9 to assist with his welding by closely watching his movements with a webcam			1
the data is fed into an algorithm which makes an ‘ educated guess ’ about what he will do next			1
whilst it is up to the designer whether or not they follow the advice , the development is the latest startling example of how advanced artificial intelligence has become			1
@entity7 , who is studying at the @entity39 in the @entity40 , told @entity41 : ‘ i designed a computer interface that actually makes suggestions to the designer while he ’s working			1
‘ ideally it will enable the designer to create something nor him or the computer itself could have come up with			2
@entity48 showing off his machine , which he programmed to help him weld metal bowls ‘ we should n’t be afraid of using technology to enhance traditional handiwork			2
’ the webcam on the machine records each cutting , measuring and notes the length of each piece of metal that @entity7 manipulates during his spot welding			1
he hopes that instead of being something sinister it will give designers another voice which they can decide to collaborate with or simply ignore			2
he has published the details on the internet as an open source code to encourage others to improve the software			0
the machine can anticipate what the user has to do next and guide them through the process of creating a bowl computer intelligence has accelerated in recent years - machines have beaten humans at chess and in one test were also able to feel ‘ regret ’			0
by understanding the difference between the desired outcome and the reality the machines are supposedly able to learn the ‘ emotion ’ and work out how to minimise it			0
the finished article - a metal bowl created with the help of the ' big brother ' machine @entity93 has developed ‘ @entity94 ’ , the world ’s first real virtual character who is convincing enough to be considered ‘ human ’			0
and @entity98 researchers have developed a robot that can perform functions it was not programmed to do , with the hope that it will learn just like a child does			0
@entity7 ’s invention was unveiled at @entity104 , a group show in @entity105 , @entity106 .			0

designed by @entity8 *engineer* to help with welding
uses webcam to monitor movements , and complex algorithms to predict what people will do next
