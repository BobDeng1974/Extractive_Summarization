wales had been criticised for unnecessary kicking against @entity70 but they used the boot more effectively in the @entity113 capital			2

@entity100 made the initial surge , @entity31 kept the move going and sent @entity25 clear for his second try of the competition			2
@entity83 joined @entity92 in the sin - bin for a second mid-air collision , but @entity5 felt the initial incident was far more serious			1

the kickers exchanged further penalties , before @entity31 had a try ruled out just before the hour			0
following a rare missed kick by @entity64 , the @entity113 defence was eventually breached			0
@entity5 had kept faith in his @entity174 and , after his yellow card , @entity83 went some way to repaying that when he ran a fine line off @entity90			0
the centre evaded the attention of @entity180 and stepped inside @entity93 to pull his side clear			0
@entity7 , meanwhile , failed to turn their pressure into points			0
@entity15 turned down a kick at goal , while @entity186 had a late score chalked off for a forward pass			0
