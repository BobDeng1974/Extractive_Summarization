it is the world ’s most aggressive and venomous spider , normally confined to the tropical forests of @entity3			1
but one family was left ‘ deeply traumatised ’ when a @entity6 wandering spider was delivered to their @entity8 home – by @entity10			1
the lethal arachnid had been hiding in bananas when drivers dropped off the online groceries			1
they were so terrified they could n’t even spend the night in their own home once the spider had been captured			0
@entity17 , who declined to give his surname , said : ‘ although people might think these things are funny , i keep thinking that the spider could have killed me or my son if he had gone to get a banana			1
’ the @entity6 wandering spider has caused 14 reported deaths , and although an antidote to its powerful neurotoxin has been developed , one pest control expert claimed there was no anti-venom in the @entity41			1
@entity42 in @entity8 held stocks , but they expired in 2011			0
@entity17 had been cooking breakfast when the supermarket van dropped off their order last weekend			1
just as he was unpacking the bananas , he spotted the spider , and , in shock , dropped the bunch into a fruit bowl , trapping the beast by one of its legs			1
@entity17 said he had been cooking breakfast when the @entity10 van dropped his shopping off			2
when the spider was removed they discovered a sac of eggs containing thousands of babies he took photographs and went online to identify it – discovering it was of a species the @entity69 calls the world ’s most venomous			1
@entity17 said : ‘ we were terrified			2
we got ourselves and our kids out of the house straight away			0
’ he and his wife @entity74 called both the supermarket and the @entity76 , which said it was unable to handle such a dangerous animal and advised them to call 999			1
but police said they , too , could not deal with the spider – whose @entity83 scientific name translates as ‘ murderess ’ and whose venom can kill in two hours – and suggested a pest control expert			1
@entity10 sent a pest expert down to tackle the spider , which he described as ' hardcore ' - the creature was eventually locked inside three separate boxes meanwhile , a @entity10 worker arrived , armed with just a freezer bag to trap the lethal spider			1
they went into the kitchen and discovered the creature had disappeared , leaving only its trapped leg behind			2
@entity17 said : ‘ we had no idea where it had gone			2
’ and when the @entity10 worker lifted up the bananas , they spotted a sac containing hundreds of spider eggs			1
it was then that they decided to evacuate the house			0
@entity10 sent pest expert @entity110 to track down the spider he described as ‘ hardcore ’			1
he disposed of the eggs – putting them in a freezer to kill them – and , armed with a 3ft stick found the creature at the bottom of the fruit bowl			2
rather than scuttling away , the spider became aggressive , standing on its back legs and showing its fangs			0
@entity124 , mr @entity110 used his stick to manoeuvre it into a heavy plastic box , which was then placed inside two other boxes			0
it is understood the spider was then taken to a scientific centre abroad			0
@entity17 said his family were ‘ too traumatised to remain in the house ’ so spent the night with friends			2
@entity10 said : ‘ the safety of our customers is our absolute priority			0
‘ we did everything we could to look after our customer during what was a distressing incident and we ’ve apologised personally			0
although this is highly unusual , we ’re taking it very seriously and will be working with our supplier to minimise the risk of this happening again			0
’ the supermarket offered the family £ 150 of shopping vouchers and a family day out in compensation			0
this is the latest of several incidents of the species finding its way to @entity41 – which experts say could be down to the trend for organic fruits not treated with chemicals that could kill the spiders			0
last month a woman in @entity160 found eggs in bananas she bought from @entity163			2
she had to incinerate her vacuum cleaner after using it to clean them up			0
in march , a family evacuated their @entity169 home after finding hundreds of hatchlings			0
last november , a @entity163 store in @entity173 had to close for several hours after a @entity6 wandering spider was found under a box of bananas			1
in the same month , a family had their @entity8 house fumigated after they bought infested bananas from @entity182 ’s .			0

@entity6 wandering spider , world *'s* most deadly arachnid , found in bunch of bananas by parents @entity17 and @entity74
store sent worker to trap it , but when they discovered egg sac filled with thousands of babies , they called in expert
pest controller described creature as ' hardcore ' and said when he tried to trap it , rather than run , it attacked
