by @entity0 published : 01:13 est , 26 november 2013 @entity2 : 04:58 est , 26 november 2013 mother with private healthcare plans are twice as likely to have a pre-planned c - section than those who give birth using an @entity9 hospital well - off mothers really are ' too posh to push ' , according to new figures which show pregnant women who have private healthcare plans are twice as likely to have a pre-planned caesarean section			1
a study has found that 21 per cent of private patients have a scheduled c - section compared to just 8.9 per cent of publicly funded ones			1
researchers examined 30,000 women who gave birth at a hospital in @entity23 which caters for both private and public - funded patients between 2008 and 2011			1
around one in five of the women paid for their treatment themselves			0
the research , published in the journal @entity29 , found that , overall , 34.4 per cent of privately paying mothers had a c - section , compared to 22.5 per cent of public patients			1
the ' greatest disparity ' noted between the mothers was the rates of scheduled c - sections , the study found			2
for first - time mothers , 11.9 per cent of private patients had pre-planned surgery compared to just 4.6 per cent of those whose care was paid for by the public purse			1
' we found that private patients are more likely than public patients to have an operative vaginal delivery or a caesarean section			1
' the difference was particularly great among women who had given birth before by c - section , while private patients were also more likely to have a surgical vaginal delivery using a vacuum or forceps			1
it may be that older , better educated women are more strongly influenced by the choices obstetricians would make for themselves , or that their own preferences more closely mirror these views			0
the authors said : ' there are several studies reporting strong personal preferences among some obstetricians for scheduled caesarean section , and indeed many of the private patients were health professionals			1
' but they said that it was not possible to determine whether the decision to give birth via c - section was driven by the expectant mother or the doctors caring for them			2
caesarean section carries a certain amount of risk - such as the wound becoming infected or the baby developing breathing difficulties			0
it also takes longer to recover than after a vaginal birth			0
the researches wrote : ' although speculative , it seems quite likely that private patients are provided with greater choice in relation to a scheduled caesarean section			2
it is debatable whether this is actually in the womanâ € ™ s best interest , particularly when it comes to the next birth			0
the @entity94 said the study highlights the need to avoid ' unnecessary ' caesarean sections ' what does need to be addressed is whether higher rates of scheduled caesarean sections among private patients create access issues for medically indicated caesarean sections , and whether these patients place a disproportionate burden on the service in the postoperative period			2
' the @entity94 said the study highlights the need to avoid ' unnecessary ' caesarean sections			0
@entity109 , research fellow at the @entity94 , said : ' this is interesting research that may throw a spotlight on the high rates of caesarean sections that we are seeing in @entity116 including the @entity117 , a number that we would like to see falling			0
' the findings also underline the need to avoid unnecessary caesarean sections as this is a major surgical operation , that has the potential for increased complications every time a woman has the procedure carried out			0
' the @entity94 therefore supports @entity127 guidelines which encourage women to have a thorough discussion with their obstetricians and midwives about the implications of having a caesarean section , especially in circumstances where other options remain open to them			0

study published in the @entity29 supports theory about middle class mums
researchers examined 30,000 patients at a hospital in @entity23
found that 21 per cent of private patients have a scheduled c - section compared to just 8.9 per cent of publicly funded ones
