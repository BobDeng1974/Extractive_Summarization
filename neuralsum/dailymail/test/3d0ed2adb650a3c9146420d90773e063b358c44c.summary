the prime minister said last night he was ‘ utterly committed ’ to the health service			1
however , the promise that all over- 75s will get a guaranteed same - day gp appointment will raise eyebrows among critics who say gps are already struggling to cope			0
health secretary @entity28 last year announced a plan to ‘ train and retain ’ an extra 5,000 gps , which @entity5 sources said last night would allow them to deliver the same - day pledge			1
the @entity34 welcomed the move as a ‘ good start ’ , but warned that , on current trends , an extra 8,000 gps would be needed by 2020 just to stand still			0
mr @entity28 said : ‘ the @entity7 has set out its vision for how we best improve the health service for patients , and today we are backing that plan with the money it needs			1
but we can only have a strong @entity7 if we have a strong economy			0

‘ that ’s why i ’m backing the @entity7 ’s own plan with the cash required to ensure it can continue to deliver an amazing service to patients and their families in the future			2
’ the @entity5 move will pile pressure on @entity19 to put its money where its mouth is on the @entity7			1
this week , @entity19 health spokesman @entity96 said he could not commit to mr @entity12 ’s five - year plan , adding : ‘ i ’m not in the business of making false promises or giving cheques to the @entity7 that will bounce a few days after the election			2
