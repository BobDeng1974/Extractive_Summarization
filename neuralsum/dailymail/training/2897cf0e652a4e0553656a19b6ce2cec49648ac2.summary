@entity2 , 41 , is the man behind @entity11 , a runaway success story which has become the leading @entity14 yogurt brand in the @entity3 with annual sales of more than $ 1 billion			1
in a short space of time @entity2 has taken an idea based on food that his parents used to make back in @entity9 and turned into a one of the fastest growing brands in the country			1
the company currently employs about 3,000 people around the world , user 40 million pounds of domestically produced milk per week , and has helped turn an economically depressed region of @entity28 into a capital of @entity14 yogurt production			1
one of seven brothers , @entity2 came to the @entity3 in 1994 to study and learn @entity32			2
he came from @entity33 , a small town in the @entity35 region of @entity36 , 400 miles east of @entity37 , where his family had tended sheep and made cheese and yogurt			2
he studies took him to @entity44 , in @entity28 , where the rolling hills reminded him of home			0

capacity at the @entity11 plant in @entity79 , @entity94 has grown from about 55,000 cases per week to nearly two million but with another brand of strained yogurt - @entity99 - proving a success at specialty stores , @entity2 felt the time was right for something different			1
in september 2007 , after two years of testing he was finally ready to go to market with @entity11 , which means shepherd in @entity9			1
part of the yogurts subsequent success has been due to making the product thicker but without adding sugar – a bold decision consisting @entity3 tastes			0
fortunately for @entity2 his timing was also good as his product , offers a lot of protein without much cholesterol or carbs , appealed to health conscious consumers			2
