click here to see @entity3 's @entity2 team from the modern era			1
for 50 years , @entity3 has been one of football ’s most colourful and outspoken characters			1
now he ’s written a book every fan will want to read			2
in @entity3 ’s new book ' a man walks on to a pitch ' - serialised exclusively by @entity13 this week - the @entity15 manager picks his two all - time greatest @entity2 teams from the early years to the present day			1
from @entity18 to @entity19 , the 67 - year - old reveals his one to 11 titans of the early @entity2 era			1
i know some people will think i ’ve gone mad			0
but @entity31 was a fantastic player in a fantastic team , whereas @entity30 was performing heroics that built a football club			1
without him , @entity36 could n’t have stayed in the top division for so long , and without that they would not have been able to build their new stadium and its fabulous academy that saw players like @entity42 and @entity43 come through the ranks			0
@entity13 can exclusively reveal @entity3 's greatest @entity45 from the early era @entity30 ’s 10 greatest goals would stand alongside those by @entity49 , @entity50 - even @entity51 or @entity52			1
he was a one - man band there for a lot of the time , like sir @entity56 had been at @entity57			1
people would ask ‘ @entity59 is n’t he playing for @entity60 then ? ’ he was just happy to be at a club he had known since he was 16 , happy to be 30 minutes away from his family in the @entity64			0
i think he would have been brilliant at a club like @entity67 , but just because he did n’t make that jump does n’t mean he ’s not smart			0
@entity30 scores against @entity60 in 1996 as @entity31 ( right ) looks on @entity30 ( left ) scores a spectacular volley for @entity36 against @entity71 in 1994 @entity31 with @entity30 in 1999 - the former @entity60 star misses out on @entity3 's @entity45 @entity23 was a different type of midfield player and one every club would like to take now			1
he almost came to me at @entity77 from @entity78			0
i thought it was an incredible decision by him , after he ’d been such a hero at @entity67			0
i met him at his house in @entity83 and he had no fear about what people would think or what reception he would get			0
he had enough confidence in his ability to just brush it away			0
i remember talking to @entity90 , our chairman , about him			0
he said the crowd would be hostile			0
i knew that - but if he had enough bottle to want to put on our white shirt after all that had gone before , i thought it said something about the man			1
@entity23 drives past @entity100 in 2001 - the @entity67 star was the ultimate box - to - box midfielder @entity23 and his great rival @entity22 clash during a match at @entity106 in 1999 - it would n't be the last time in the end , his circumstances changed and he decided to stay in @entity109			1
by the time he did become available - the following january - our needs had changed and @entity112 snapped him up			1
@entity23 is the player @entity67 have never really replaced , but i still find it bizarre that he ended up in a blazer at @entity112			2
should n’t he be at @entity67 ? it is ironic that so many associate @entity117 with the beautiful game , yet his @entity67 teams , with @entity23 - the ultimate box - to - box midfielder - did as much as anybody to introduce real physical power into the modern @entity2			1
@entity123 : a leader of men at 16 i first saw him aged 16 and i do n’t think i have ever seen a player of that age bossing a game in that way			2
it stayed with me for a long time			2
@entity123 was such an influence that he as good as ran every dressing - room he played in , for @entity133 and @entity67			1
@entity123 was a brilliant and inspirational captain who led from the front for @entity67 , says @entity3 @entity3 saw @entity123 play as a 16 - year - old and said he bossed the game at an extremely young age @entity123 ( left ) clears the ball away during an international for @entity133 against @entity141 at @entity142 in 1992 @entity19 would have solved @entity133 's problems ... he was born to play left wing @entity117 heralded a change in @entity147 football ... he introduced @entity148 and scouting reports @entity150 has the class of @entity42 but his attitude is holding back his talent @entity23 and @entity22 are warriors ... they were even prepared to do battle while working on tv ! why @entity3 fears that the @entity147 manager is in danger of becoming extinct @entity23 nearly crossed @entity159 to join @entity77 ... and @entity160 was close to signing too pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players ... the @entity2 killed all that ! @entity13 's @entity167 interviews @entity3 about his new book @entity169 : search - and - destroy ' psycho ' my @entity172 chairman would n’t let me buy him , aged 34 , because he said he was too old			1
i eventually got him at 37 , he played 50 games in two seasons and was voted @entity176			0
he was on a search - and - destroy mission in every game			2
the first time the ball came to you he was going to smash you , run all over you , chip you into the stand and then take the ball , run forward and shoot			2
then he ’d get back just as fast as he got up			0
he was a dream left - back			0
@entity169 , nicknamed ' psycho ' and seen screaming during @entity187 , was the ' perfect left back ' @entity3 ( left ) eventually signed @entity169 at @entity172 as a 37 - year - old having courted him for years the left back , here playing for @entity188 against @entity189 in 1998 , was good in attack and defence @entity22 : the pussycat do you know why it took so long for @entity22 to get his break as a kid ? he was a bit timid			1
unbelievable is n’t it ? but those were the words of our @entity203 scout , and he knew him inside out			0
he was a right - winger at the time , and they thought he was a bit soft			2
it is amazing how people change			0
@entity22 ( right ) was not picked up by @entity3 's @entity203 scout because he was deemed to be a ' bit timid ' @entity22 forged a wonderful career with @entity60 , including captaining them against @entity213 @entity22 takes a swing at old foe @entity18 during a @entity60 defeat at @entity188 in 2001 the former @entity218 midfielder ( right ) competes for the ball during a match for @entity221 in 1992 the front cover of @entity3 's new book , a man walks on to a pitch , which is released on thursday ' a man walks on to a pitch ' by @entity3 is published by @entity230 , priced £ 20			1
