a new and potentially deadly form of bird flu has claimed its first confirmed human victim - a woman in @entity3 a new and potentially deadly form of bird flu has claimed its first confirmed victim			1
tests revealed that a previously unknown sub-strain of the @entity10 virus killed a woman who was admitted to hospital in @entity3 with fever and pneumonia			1
the woman , from @entity16 in @entity18 province , died nine days after becoming ill despite antibiotic and antiviral treatment			1
experts believe the strain spread from poultry and may pose the threat of a pandemic			2
the dead woman had visited a live poultry market a few days prior to her illness , suggesting an incubation time of around four days - similar to that of other bird flu strains			1
reports suggest the victim was not an isolated case			0
at least one other person is believed to have been infected by the same strain in @entity18			1
dr @entity36 , from the @entity37 in @entity38 , said : ‘ a genetic analysis of the @entity10 virus shows a virus that is distinct from previously reported @entity43 viruses , having evolved some genetic characteristics that may allow it to replicate efficiently in humans			2
’ the strain is thought to have emerged from multiple re-assortments of genes from different bird flu viruses			0
notably , it shares genes with three other bird flu strains , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , the last two of which have spread to humans			0
scientists conducted tests on swab samples taken from the woman victim 's windpipe			0
their results , reporting the first human death associated with @entity43 , appear in @entity67 medical journal			2
co-investigator dr @entity68 , from the @entity69 and @entity70 in @entity38 , said : ‘ importantly , the virus had a mutation in the @entity74 gene that is believed to be associated with increased virulence and adaption in mammals , and could enable the virus to become more infectious to people			0
’ the @entity43 strain was previously found in a water sample taken from @entity82 in @entity83 in 2007			2
in 2012 , it was detected at a live poultry market in @entity86			1
the woman is believed to have become infected while visiting a live poultry market in @entity3 co-author dr @entity89 , from @entity90 and @entity91 warned that the threat should not be taken lightly			1
‘ a second case of @entity43 was identified in @entity18 , @entity3 on january 26 , 2014 , ’ said dr @entity89			1
‘ this is of great concern because it reveals that the @entity10 virus has continued to circulate and may cause more human infections in future			0
’ dr @entity101 , director of the @entity102 at the @entity103 ( @entity104 ) in @entity105 , said : ‘ this case reminds us to be aware of human infections from animal influenza viruses			0
‘ previously we did not think that @entity54 infections might be so lethal			0
‘ more human infections by avian @entity43 viruses can not be ruled out			2
@entity43 viruses are of low pathogenicity in poultry and so infection in birds is not easy to detect			1
whether humans are frequently exposed and infected is also not known			0
‘ he added that the underlying condition of the dead woman was likely to have worsened her infection .			0

a woman in @entity3 died after contracting a new sub-strain of @entity43
she is thought to have *picked* up the illness at a live poultry market
she died despite antibiotic and antiviral treatment in hospital
at least one other person in @entity3 is also believe to have been infected
