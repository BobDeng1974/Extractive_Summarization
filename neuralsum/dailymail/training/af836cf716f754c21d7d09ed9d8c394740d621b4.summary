by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:34 est , 21 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:35 est , 21 december 2013 some lucky @entity3 could be in for a white @entity4 this year , according to new predictions from the @entity6			1
forecasters said people in @entity9 , @entity10 and high areas elsewhere in the country could be greeted by snowflakes on christmas morning			1
the @entity6 's technical definition of a white @entity4 only requires one snowflake to fall anywhere in the country , making it very likely that this year will fit the bill			1
according to the @entity6 , heavy rain will pass late on christmas eve to make way for snowfall across the @entity22 parts of the @entity22 , including the @entity24 , already have a light coating of snow that will thicken only 14 years of the past 52 have failed to produce snow somewhere in the @entity22			1
and in 2014 , northern areas higher than 200m above sea level , and southern areas above 400m are likely to be in line for a light dusting			0
and bright and mild weather is likely to greet the rest of us on christmas day , after blustery lead - up			1
analysts said that there will be ' pleasant ' conditions with highs of 6 degrees centigrade in the north and 8 degrees in the north of the country			0
@entity44 , a forecaster with the @entity6 , said : ' @entity45 could fall above a couple of hundred metres in the north and 400m in the south			1
' there wo n’t be widespread snow but it will be largely over hills and higher ground			0
' ' the official definition of a white @entity4 is just one snowflake falling in that 24 - hour period			1
most people think of a white @entity4 as seeing a little bit more than that , though			2
travellers are warned to take care when driving over the @entity4 period as temperatures plummet a white @entity4 is technically when one snowflake falls , which has happened 38 christmases in the last 52 years			2
widespread snow has only occurred four times in the same time period ' for a lot of the @entity22 it ’ll be a fairly decent day , with some sunshine , lighter winds than the previous few days – feeling a little bit more pleasant , though it will be quite chilly – between 4 and 6 degrees in the north and 5 and 8 degrees in the south			1
' ' there will be showers , but largely towards western parts of the @entity22 , in @entity10 , @entity9 and south - west @entity79			2
' places like the @entity9 hills and mountains could see a bit of snow , as could the @entity85 and the mountains in @entity10			2
' according to the @entity88 , bookmakers @entity87 have now cut their odds for snow falling in @entity91 on christmas day from 12/1 to 8/1			1
odds for @entity93 and @entity94 are 3/1 , with @entity95 at 4/1 , @entity96 at 6/1 and @entity97 and @entity98 at 8/1			0
a spokesman said : “ punters had given up all hope of a @entity4 but the latest news has seen a flurry of bets for a festive snowfall on december 25th			2
' while most dream of gardens blanketed with crisp , white snow , the @entity6 says the definition is of a single snowflake falling in the 24 hours of december 25			1
but we are often left disappointed as climate history shows wintry weather is more likely between january and march			0
@entity45 or sleet falls on average five days in december , compared to 7.6 days in january , 6.8 days in february and six days in march			0
but we can remain optimistic as at least one snowflake has fallen on 38 @entity116 in the last 52 years			0
@entity45 lying on the ground on @entity118 is much rarer			0
@entity119 were more frequent in the 18th and 19th centuries , according to the @entity6			0
the change of calendar in 1752 , which effectively brought @entity118 back by 12 days , also minimised the chances			0
climate change has also brought higher average temperatures over land and sea , which generally reduces the probability of a white @entity4			2
but experts claim that will not make them less likely in the future .			0
