by @entity0 published : 21:15 est , 8 january 2013 updated : 07:38 est , 9 january 2013 an @entity2 hospital has been found guilty of making bogus claims about the benefits of hypnosis for serious medical conditions			1
the @entity7 has been told to withdraw a leaflet it issued promoting hypnosis treatment for a number of conditions including mental health problems and irritable bowel syndrome			1
the hospital , whose patron is the @entity18 , is part of the group of @entity21 @entity2 trust and calls itself the largest public sector provider of integrated medicine in @entity24			0
the @entity7 has been told to withdraw a leaflet promoting hypnosis treatment for serious conditions apart from hypnosis , its clinicians offer various alternative medical therapies including homeopathy and acupuncture			1
a leaflet issued by the @entity36 hospital headed ‘ @entity40 ’ made a number of impressive claims for the treatment			1
it boasted : ‘ hypnosis can benefit almost anyone to improve their physical , emotional and mental health			2
’ it then went on to provide a long list of conditions which it could help alleviate including problems with the immune , nervous and gastro - intestinal systems			1
the leaflet said hypnosis could also help sufferers with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and dyspepsia			1
the benefits of hypnosis were questioned by a campaigning group called the @entity60 which was set up to challenge claims made for quack treatments			1
it made a formal complaint to the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) , which ruled that most of the hospital ’s claims for hypnotherapy could not be substantiated			1
the leaflet said hypnosis could help sufferers with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and dyspepsia the hospital provided a raft of clinical studies and research papers to back up their claims , however these failed to satisfy the advertising watchdog			1
its decision calls into question the use of hypnosis in the @entity2 , where millions of pounds of public money is spent offering the controversial therapy			2
the @entity65 said there is evidence that hypnotherapy can help relieve anxiety , confidence issues and minor skin conditions , but it said the hospital was wrong to make wider claims about improving mental and physical health			1
it said most of the trials and studies presented by the hospital to justify its claims were too small to provide meaningful conclusions			0
‘ we concluded that the claim ‘ hypnosis can benefit almost anyone to improve their physical , emotional and mental health ’ exaggerated the potential benefit to patients ’ mental and physical health and was therefore misleading , ’ it said			2
the hospital was told to withdraw the leaflet by the @entity65 , which said most of the hospital 's claims could not be substantiated similarly , the hospital was unable to provide convincing evidence of benefits for the immune , nervous or gastro - intestinal systems			1
the @entity65 did side with the hospital over claims that hypnosis can help people cope with the effects of chronic pain , such as headaches , cancer pain and rheumatism			1
however , it banned the hospital from issuing the leaflet again and told executives to make sure that they have ‘ robust evidence ’ to substantiate medical claims in any future publications			1
it said : ‘ in summary , we considered that the body of evidence provided by @entity135 , as a whole , had supported the notion that hypnotherapy might help people to cope with and manage pain , and with perceived relief of pain			0
‘ however , we considered that the leaflet had misleadingly implied more : that hypnotherapy could treat or cure the conditions listed , an interpretation for which we had not seen suitably robust evidence			1
’ the hospital said it took the @entity65 ruling ‘ very seriously ’			1
it added : ‘ we will make the necessary changes to bring our patient information in line with their guidance			0
in the meantime we have withdrawn the leaflet concerned and have amended our website accordingly			2
’ two unrelated adverts which referred to @entity160 have been ruled harmful and offensive following complaints that they made light of allegations of sexual abuse against the disgraced tv presenter			2
an email for clothing company @entity167 read ' choose your fate ' with arrows pointing to a cartoon image of @entity172			0
one person complained that the ad was offensive and irresponsible because it made light of the allegations under investigation			2
another email for @entity178 read ' how 's about that then ' in large print above a black and white image of @entity172 wearing underwear and smoking a cigar with a superimposed copy of a magazine in his hand			0
two complainants challenged whether the ad was offensive and irresponsible in view of recent media coverage surrounding the abuse allegations			0
@entity167 acknowledged that some people may have found the cartoon image of @entity172 distasteful but they considered it would not cause serious or widespread offence			0
@entity178 , trading as @entity195 , said it did not intend to offend or upset anyone by sending the email			0
the ( @entity65 ) said the adverts were likely to cause serious offence to some			1
it said : ' we told them to ensure they prepared their ads with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society , and to ensure they did not cause serious or widespread offence			2
' a campaign for @entity211 honey has been banned for making a ' misleading ' claim that it is a natural source of slow release energy			0
the television advert , which screened in april last year , featured a boy squeezing honey on to his porridge before heading off to school where he was shown playing football and participating in lessons , while a voiceover said : ' @entity211 honey is a natural source of slow release energy for busy boys and girls			0
' nine viewers complained that the slow release energy claim was misleading			0
defending the ad , @entity227 said it believed the term ' slow release energy ' implied the energy was delivered more slowly than a comparable food or ingredient			0
it believed @entity211 honey qualified for the claim because it was a significant source of fructose , pointing out that the @entity239 ( @entity239 ) had said that ' fructose is more slowly absorbed in the gastro - intestinal tract than glucose '			0
however the @entity65 said it understood from its own expert foods were deemed to have a low gi when the value was 55 or below , noting that the @entity211 test gave a value of between 50 and 60			2
it said : ' because the ad did not make clear that the consumption of @entity227 honey led to a lower blood glucose rise than the consumption of sucrose or glucose - containing foods , we concluded that the claim was misleading and therefore breached the @entity256			0
' it ruled : ' the ad must not be broadcast again in its current form			0
