@entity0 was today accused of ' unpleasant , careless elitism ' after claiming some people were not bright enough to get on in the modern world			1
the @entity5 mayor was condemned by deputy prime minister @entity6 , who accused the senior conservative of talking about human beings like ' dogs '			1
mr @entity0 used a speech in tribute to @entity12 to argue that tackling economic inequality is ‘ futile ’ because some people ’s iq is too low for them to compete			1
he called for the creation of a new generation of grammar schools to help the brightest children from poor homes			1
he also appeared to echo the fictional film character @entity30 , whose notorious motto was ‘ greed is good ’ , saying that greed was ‘ a valuable spur to economic activity ’			0
but he insisted he did not want the economic recovery to breed a new generation of ‘ heartless ’ bankers			0
delivering the annual @entity39 – staged by the right - wing @entity41 think - tank – he insisted the rich had a duty to help the poor and embrace philanthropy.and he urged the government to do much more to help bright children from poor homes to get a good education			0
@entity5 mayor @entity0 he called for the reintroduction of @entity50 ’s assisted places scheme , which paid for the brightest poor children to go to public schools – and accused the @entity53 of hypocrisy for blocking a revival of the grammar school system			1
but his most controversial comments came when he said globalisation was intensifying the trend towards inequality			2
mr @entity0 said : ‘ i am afraid that violent economic centrifuge is operating on human beings who are already very far from equal in raw ability , if not spiritual worth			1
‘ whatever you may think of the value of iq tests , it is surely relevant to a conversation about equality that as many as 16 per cent of our species have an iq below 85 , while about 2 per cent have an iq above 130			0
‘ the harder you shake the pack , the easier it will be for some cornflakes to get to the top			0
and for one reason or another – boardroom greed or , as i am assured , the natural and @entity86 - given talent of boardroom inhabitants – the income gap between the top cornflakes and the bottom cornflakes is getting wider than ever			0
‘ i stress i do n’t believe that economic equality is possible			0
indeed , some measure of inequality is essential for the spirit of envy and keeping up with the @entity93 that is , like greed , a valuable spur to economic activity			1
’ tribute : mr @entity0 made the comments at the third annual @entity99 - staged by the right - wing @entity41 think - tank but mr @entity6 condemned the remarks for writing off whole swathes of people who should be given the change to get on			1
' i do n’t agree with @entity0 on this , ' he told his @entity108 radio phone - in			2
' much as he is a funny and engaging guy , i have to say these comments reveal a fairly unpleasant , careless elitism that somehow suggests that we should give up on a whole swath of our fellow citizens			0
' to talk about us as if we are a breed of dog , a species he called it ... i think the danger is if you start taking such a deterministic view of people and start saying they ’ve got a number attached to them , in this case an iq number , somehow they ’re not really going to rise to the top of the cornflake packet ... ' that is complete anathema to everything i ’ve always stood for in politics , which is , yes of course , you should n't aspire - and as an old - fashioned @entity134 i do n’t aspire to a perfectly homogenous society where everyone has the same kind of outcomes but you ’ve got to try and do more to instil greater opportunity in society			2
' he accused some @entity53 of trying to relive the 1980s heyday of @entity12 's premiership			2
' it is not 1986 , it is 2013			0
' @entity147 refused to be drawn into the row			0
@entity150 's official spokesman said : ' i do n't know whether he has read @entity0 's speech but what i do know is the pm 's view about the importance of equality of opportunity			2
' the mayor of @entity5 , along with prime minister @entity150 , was educated at @entity160 , @entity161 mr @entity0 , who last week called for the ten biggest taxpayers to be handed knighthoods , acknowledged that growing inequality was creating ‘ resentment ’			1
he said ministers needed to do more to promote social mobility			0
‘ though it would be wrong to persecute the rich , and madness to try and stifle wealth creation , and futile to try to stamp out inequality , we should only tolerate this wealth gap on two conditions			2
‘ one , that we help those who genuinely can not compete ; and , two , that we provide opportunity for those who can			0
’ mr @entity0 , who served as a shadow education minister under @entity150 , suggested the @entity53 had been guilty of hypocrisy in ruling out the creation of a new generation of grammar schools			1
educated at @entity160 with mr @entity150 , the mayor said : ‘ i remember once sitting in a meeting of the @entity184 shadow education team and listening with mounting disbelief to a conversation in which we all agreed solemnly that it would be political madness to try to bring back the grammar schools – while i happened to know that most of the people in that room were about to make use , as parents , of some of the most viciously selective schools in the country			1
’ he acknowledged that @entity12 had closed many grammar schools , but said that if she was here today he hoped she would find a way ‘ to help bright children everywhere to overcome their background ’			1
in a wide - ranging speech mr @entity0 also called for an end to the ‘ madness ’ of @entity203 immigration			1
mr @entity0 appeared to echo the film character @entity30 ( pictured ) , whose notorious motto was ' greed is good ' , saying that greed was ' a valuable spur to economic activity ' @entity210 ‘ whatever you may think of the value of iq tests , it is surely relevant to a conversation about equality that as many as 16 per cent of our species have an iq below 85 , while about 2 per cent have an iq above 130			1
’ @entity221 ‘ i do n’t believe that economic equality is possible			0
indeed , some measure of inequality is essential for the spirit of envy and keeping up with the @entity93 that is , like greed , a valuable spur to economic activity			2
’ @entity230 ‘ i hope that this time the @entity231 of @entity5 are conspicuous not just for their greed ... as for what they give and do for the rest of the population			0
’ @entity238 ‘ i remember once sitting in a meeting of the @entity184 shadow education team and listening with mounting disbelief to a conversation in which we all agreed solemnly that it would be political madness to try to bring back the grammar schools ... most of the people in that room were about to make use , as parents , of some of the most viciously selective schools			2
’ @entity251 ‘ it ’s time to sort out the immigration system so that we end the madness ... we are claiming to have capped immigration by having a 60 per cent reduction in @entity258 , when we can do nothing to stop the entire population of @entity261 – charming though most of them may be – from trying to come here			0
