engineering students have created a couch with wheels that has been driving them around campus and to adventures across the road			1
it began as a joke between a couple of students at the @entity10 at @entity11 in @entity12 but after suggesting the idea to their supervisor the development of an electric couch was brought forward			2
' we use much smaller versions of these wheels on little robots we make at university ... we suggested to one of our supervisors that we build a couch on giant wheels and so we did , ' @entity18 , one of the students behind the project told @entity30			0
' we 've got the scooter wheels inside that we 've bolted down , attached all the gears and chains and then we put the modified @entity34 couch on top , ' ms @entity18 said			2
she said it looks like any other couch on the outside but in the inside it has been stripped and replaced to allow transformation of an average @entity34 couch to a moving robot			1
the electric device can move in any direction which is manually controlled by an @entity41 game - pad			1
students have been having fun with the electric cushioned seat as they ride around campus on it			0
the video above show @entity78 students laughing as they navigate their way through elevators and on footpaths while they sit on the red double - seated robot couch			1
' we did take it down to @entity85 one night that is close to campus - we have had a few adventures with it , ' ms @entity18 said			0
' seeing a couch move around is much more exciting than a robot			0
' in the future @entity78 hopes to add more senses and intelligence to the device .			0

engineering students from @entity78 have developed a robot couch
it looks a *normal* @entity34 couch but inside it has been stripped and replaced with technology and wheels
the electric couch operates with an @entity41 game - pad and can move in any direction
students have been taking the couch on *joy* rides around campus
