a honeymoon is the perfect chance for the newlywed couple to spend time with each other , away from the stresses of everyday life			2
but @entity7 and @entity8 , have taken that idea and run with it - or ridden with it			1
rather than taking time out for some post-wedding luxuriating on a beach or at a spa hotel , the couple decided to spend two years in a record - breaking attempt to travel the world on a tandem bicycle , sleeping in a tiny two - man tent			1
incredibly , @entity7 , 31 , had never even ridden a bike more than a few yards before they decided to take on the challenge , which they began in may this year			1
the intrepid couple gave up well - paid jobs as a teacher and caseworker for the @entity46 before leaving their chickens and cat at their home in @entity34 , south east @entity35 , with friends who will spend the next two years house - sitting			1
six months and almost 9,000km later they arrived in @entity53 , on the northern tip of @entity55 , having braved arctic temperatures , snow , heavy rain and high winds , followed by searing heat and the mechanical challenges of pushing @entity62 , their heavily - laden tandem , to the limit			1
@entity67 ride : the couple 's journey from @entity31 to @entity35 via three continents will last well into 2014 @entity7 said : ' the first four months of this trip were so hard			1
we cycled through gallons of rain and waves of gales			0
' my feet felt like they were constantly soaked and at times i wanted to give up so much , so that i could enjoy a beer and good company with friends or the warmth of a fire or a sunday roast at mum ’s or a belly - aching laugh with my brother or a family knees - up in @entity89			0
' and dare i say it , even working in a dry office felt appealing at times			0
' but completing @entity92 represents less than a quarter of the monumental trip and the pair are now in @entity95 , @entity96 , as part of the start of the marathon @entity100 leg of their journey , which will take them through @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and into @entity110			2
home sweet home : the tiny tent the pair call home on their epic trek			2
they are raising money for development charity @entity119 hardened : the pair traded comfortable lives in @entity35 for intense physical activity and spartan conditions once through @entity110 , they plan to go into @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and into @entity131 , when the @entity133 leg of the adventure will start			0
the couple hope to return to the @entity136 in early 2014 , having beaten the previous world record of 38,143kms set by @entity138 and @entity139 15 years ago			1
they are completing the trip to raise money for @entity136 international development charity @entity119 , which uses technology to help solve the problems of people living in poverty in the developing world			0
@entity8 , 33 , who taught at @entity148 in @entity149 said : ' we have found the first months very hard and we have n't had the energy or the contacts to do very much other than cycle , which is n’t exactly a traditional way of enjoying a honeymoon ! the couple get some practice in the @entity136 before setting off on their global odyssey ' at first , we were also not sure whether we could do what we were planning to do but now that we have completed six months and the @entity161 we feel much more confident that we can do this			1
' if we do , it will be the most amazing achievement			0
the world record is just something we added in as a fun extra			0
' it should n’t take away from the more important things on our trip , which is how we cope with all the adventures and challenges we have on the way			0
we will see people living in poverty and struggling to survive , which will make us even more determined to raise money for @entity119			0
