@entity0 has become the latest celebrity to fall victim to the @entity4 hackers			1
in what appear to be more leaked e-mails from the corporation - published by @entity8 is allegedly branded a ' minimally talented spoiled brat ' by movie producer @entity10			1
the e-mail claims @entity8 was displeased to learn that @entity12 was going to be directing the upcoming @entity14 biopic as opposed to a re-make of @entity16 that she would play the lead in , and was pressuring @entity4 to get him to direct her film			1
@entity10 appears to refer to @entity8 as ' a minimally talented spoiled brat ' before viciously slamming her in multiple e-mails allegedly leaked in the recent @entity4 hacking scandal			1
' [ @entity0 ] is upset about us giving david jobs she wants to talk , ' @entity32 , 56 , reportedly tells @entity10 in a leaked e-mail dated february 27			1
but he apparently had no interest in discussing the matter with the @entity46 star , saying , ' she ’ll survive it			0
i do n’t want to waste my time on this			0
' later that day , he appears to have sent another e-mail to @entity32 , which read , ‘ @entity53 before she makes it very hard for @entity55 to do jobs			0
’ she appears to respond with , ' do not f * * king threaten me			0
' close friend : @entity0 's husband @entity60 ( above ) has worked with @entity12 numerous times before , on films such as @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 at odds : the emails seem to make it clear that @entity10 ( left ) and @entity32 ( right ) have a very toxic relationship it is claimed that @entity10 proceeds to criticize @entity8 a number of cutting remarks , and the idea of the movie altogether			1
the alleged email states : ' there is no movie of @entity16 to be made ( and how that is a bad thing and rampaging spoiled ego of this woman and the cost of the movie is beyond me ) and if you wo n’t tell her that you do not like the script — which , let me remind you , she does n’t either — this will just spin even further out in @entity87 but let me tell you i have zero appetite for the indulgence of spoiled brats and i will tell her this myself if you do n’t			1
' among other things , @entity32 apparently says in her more civil response , ' you know @entity96 and she have always wanted @entity12 and i have been the one saying no for two years			2
i have asked you to talk to her with me and you do n't want to deal with it			0
' the @entity96 being referred to is likely @entity100 , who wrote the script for the remake and previously worked with @entity12 when he penned @entity65			0
however , this allegedly caused @entity10 to launch into yet another tirade in which he appears to insult the unbroken director some more			2
' if you engage in this again , we will end up losing @entity12 on the one we want him to do and will be stuck with shoving him onto a movie with no script that , underneath it all , you know in your heart and your brain should never be made , ' he apparently writes in the email			2
' i 'm not remotely interested in presiding over a $ 180m ego bath that we both know will be the career - defining debacle for us both			0
' i 'm not destroying my career over a minimally talented spoiled brat who thought nothing of shoving this off her plate for eighteen months so she could go direct a movie			1
i have no desire to be making a movie with her , or anybody , that she runs and that we do n't			0
' he allegedly goes on : ' she 's a camp event and a celebrity and that 's all and the last thing anybody needs is to make a giant bomb with her that any fool could see coming			1
' we will end up being the laughing stock of our industry and we will deserve it , which is so clearly where this is headed that i can not believe we are still wasting our time with it			0
’ keeping calm : @entity8 did not seem at all bothered by the leaked emails when she was photographed out in @entity149 on wednesday also attacked : @entity150 , the 28 - year - old producer of @entity151 ( seen above with the film 's stars @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 ) is called a ' bipolar lunatic ' in one email coming back : @entity159 later took to @entity160 to respond to the leaked email and comments made by @entity10 in the end @entity10 may have been right , as @entity12 did indeed leave the @entity14 picture , something @entity32 seemed to realize when she received an email blast from entertainment site the wrap that alluded to behind the scenes problems with @entity12 and the studio over the @entity14 film			1
after the site wrote that he was leaving the film , @entity32 wrote @entity12 saying , ' wtf			2
' @entity12 attempted to diffuse the situation by making a comment about another story in the blast , the announcement that girls star @entity181 had landed the role of the main villain in the upcoming @entity185 film			1
' @entity181 is a terrible idea , ' responded @entity12 to @entity32 's email			2
the wrap was right however , and now @entity189 , who won an @entity190 for @entity191 , will direct @entity14 , a film that recently lost its star , @entity193 , and replaced him with @entity194			1
wooed : emails appear to show producers attempting to convince @entity197 to star in @entity14 @entity14 drama : @entity193 ( left ) was originally star in the @entity14 biopic , which will now star @entity194 ( right ) , whose genitalia is the subject of one email ouch : @entity204 ( above ) is called a ' whore ' by one studio executive after requesting more money to promote his film on social media this after the studio aggressively tried to woo @entity197 in a series of emails that also leaked , saying it would be great for him and @entity189 to be working together again 15 years after they filmed @entity216			1
the emails also reveal that in addition to his talent , people at @entity4 are also impressed with @entity194 's penis , with producer @entity223 allegedly claiming in one email that the star , ' makes you feel bad to have normal sized male genitalia			1
' as for @entity10 's notorious rage , the producer also seems to have it out for @entity150 , the 28 - year - old daughter of @entity230 billionaire @entity159 who has quickly made a name for herself by producing @entity190 worthy fare such as @entity151 , her and @entity233			2
@entity10 appears to describe her as a ' bipolar 28 year old lunatic ' in one email			1
@entity10 and @entity32 meanwhile seemed to have parted ways as well , with @entity236 now set to produce @entity14			1
another set of emails that leaked reveal that @entity204 received $ 3million to do his last film for the studio , likely @entity241 , and that his team demanded more money for him to promote the movie on social media			1
this did not sit well with studio executive @entity247 , who wrote to @entity32 in an email , ' it 's not as if we paid him @entity251 and @entity252 respectively for his last 2 films thinking he might be nominated			2
we paid for his ability to open a film which included his social media savvy			0
' he then calls @entity204 a ' whore			0
' a representative for @entity0 did not immediately respond when contacted by @entity259			0
@entity4 hackers release aliases used by stars including @entity263 and @entity264 @entity4 ' embarrassment over leaked details of its business deepened as hackers released the aliases used by its stars to travel incognito			2
the cache of confidential documents leaked from @entity4 's archives includes the assumed names actors and actresses use to check into hotels and book car services			2
@entity263 , @entity264 , @entity278 and @entity279 will all be forced to switch their pseudonyms after their details were published online by the so - called @entity283 hacker group			0
the new leaks also reportedly include contact details , including phone numbers , for the likes of @entity60 , @entity288 and @entity289 , as well as film budgets , scripts , details of legal claims and private employee information			0
contact details : the secret aliases and contact details of @entity299 stars - including , from left , @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity60 - are among the latest documents stolen by hackers from @entity4 the latest batch of leaked files includes a folder containing ' publicity bibles ' for many recent @entity4 releases which include phone numbers and email addresses for cast and crew on film sets , @entity303 reports			1
they reveal that @entity289 sometimes travels under the pseudonyms ' @entity315 ' or ' @entity317 ' ; @entity318 goes as ' @entity319 ' ; while @entity279 adopts the rapper-esque name ' @entity320 '			0
@entity323 officials have denied accusations they are behind the hacking raid on @entity4 , despite increasing evidence apparently linking the pariah state to the attack			0
but they called it a ' righteous deed '			0
a theory has been that @entity323 hackers targeted the film company out of anger at the release of the interview , starring @entity337 and @entity338 as tv reporters hired by the @entity340 to assassinate @entity341			0
yesterday a missive apparently posted by the hackers on code - sharing site @entity344 demanded @entity4 ' stop immediately showing the movie of terrorism which can break the regional peace and cause the war ! '			0

new emails released as the result of the @entity4 hack detail the behind the scenes drama surrounding @entity0 's upcoming film @entity16
@entity0 very much wanted to work with director @entity12 , who the studio was hoping to use for their @entity14 biopic @entity14

@entity10 also seems to attack @entity0 's ' spoiled ego ' and calls her a ' camp event '
other emails shows producers trying to get @entity197 to star in @entity14 after @entity371 backs out
in another email , one producer says of @entity194 , who is now set to star in @entity14 , ' he makes you feel bad to have normal sized male genitalia '
