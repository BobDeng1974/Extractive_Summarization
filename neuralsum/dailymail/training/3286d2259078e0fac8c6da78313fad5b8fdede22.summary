by @entity0 for @entity1 in every pair of siblings there is always a good one and a bad one , and it seems the same is true of bear cubs			1
wildlife photographer @entity8 , 43 , captured one male brown bear cub picking on his sister while he was on a visit to @entity12			1
mr @entity8 , who lives in @entity13 , @entity14 , says : ' i could see the male tormenting the female every chance he got			2
how rude : a male brown bear cub appears to stick his tongue out at his sister after the pair were pictured play fighting with each other in @entity12 wildlife photographer @entity8 , 43 , said the male cub kept picking on his sister , and even bit her on the backside after chasing her mr @entity8 said the female cub was rarely the aggressor and even ran to her mother for safety after her brother kept on biting her ' while she held her own , she was rarely the aggressor and from time to time would get mad at her brother and would try to hide by cuddling her mom			1
' ' when she had enough she tried to run away , but the little boy was n't having any of that			0
he chased after her and bit her on the bum			2
' the brown bear cubs are only 15 - months - old and eager to play with each other ; however it seems the brother bear often takes it a little too far			1
mr @entity8 estimates that the two cubs were only 15 months old when he photographed them in 2011 , and were still keen on playing together the misbehaving male brown bear climbs on the back of his long - suffering sister in @entity12 as photographer @entity8 captured images mr @entity8 said he likes anthropomorphic images , in which the animals seem to be carrying out human actions suck as sticking their tongues out mr @entity8 , a self - taught photographer , said : ' the funny thing about anthropomorphism is it can happen at any time			1
people often ask about the story behind the images			0
truthfully , the stories of any interest are normally what happens behind the scenes in a strange country			0
' a brown bear cub wets his lips or tastes the air , and it looks like he is sticking his tongue out at his sister because of her body language as she cuddles up to her mom			2
i enjoy anthropomorphic images and am over the moon when i am lucky enough to acquire these kinds of images			0
' the photographer explained that many of his colleagues are in the field taking pictures up to 200 days per year			0
he added : ' i have to find a way to compete with them with only 14 days on safari per year			0
' unlike many of his colleagues who can spend up to 200 days in the field every year , mr @entity8 only spends 14 days on safari while these young bear cubs are small , they will eventually weigh up to 700lbs as adults , eat up to 90lb of food each day and measure up to 8ft long a brown bear cub dries off while being watched by its sibling in @entity12 where photographer @entity8 captured images of the pair playing together			1
