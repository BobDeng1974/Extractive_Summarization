by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 09:30 est , 18 february 2014 @entity3 : 09:40 est , 18 february 2014 having hundreds of @entity5 friends may seem like the ultimate sign of popularity and happiness , yet it could actually suggest the opposite			2
researchers from @entity12 compared personality traits to levels of happiness among more than 16,000 people over a four - year period			1
people listed as extroverted at the start of the study gradually saw an increase in wellbeing , but as this wellbeing and happiness increased , the same participants became more introverted and withdrawn			1
researchers compared personality traits to levels of well - being in 16,367 participants			1
people who were more outgoing at the start of the four - year study saw increased levels of happiness			1
yet as this happiness increased , the outgoing participants became more introverted , and withdrawn a 2012 study by @entity37 found introverts experience greater happiness when they act more extroverted			1
while follow - up studies found that introverts have an exaggerated fear of embarrassment from acting like an extrovert			0
researchers from @entity46 recently found that a profile photo on @entity5 tells friends , or potential friends , all they need to know to form an impression of someone and virtually no words are necessary			0
in one experiment , college students who viewed a @entity5 photo of a fellow student having fun with friends rated that person as extroverted - even if his profile said he was ' not a big people - person			0
' the only exception is when a photo is out of the ordinary or shows someone in a negative light			0
in that case , people do use profile text to help interpret what kind of person is shown in the profile			0
this suggests having lots of friends can ultimately make people less sociable , and can increase sadness - the opposite of what the researchers expected			1
lead author professor @entity83 added this could be because the participants felt they no longer needed to seek out new relationships			0
professor @entity83 , from @entity88 , analysed personality traits and well - being among 16,367 participants who were surveyed repeatedly over four years			1
he was able to examine which aspects of personality at the start of the study predicted which patterns of well - being later on , and whether wellbeing at the start was linked to later personality changes			0
the results showed that people ' who were initially extraverted , agreeable , conscientious , and emotionally stable subsequently increased in well - being			0
' but they also revealed that people with high levels of well - being to begin with ' subsequently became more agreeable , conscientious , emotionally stable , and introverted			2
' increased introversion for happy people was the opposite of what had been expected because higher extraversion usually leads to greater future happiness			1
the findings suggests having lots of friends in real - life , and on social networks such as @entity5 , can ultimately make people less sociable , and increase sadness			1
the study claims this could be because the participants felt they no longer needed to seek out new relationships it suggests that the influence of personality on well - being was ‘ somewhat stronger ’ than well - being on personality , yet both were significant when forming relationships			2
links observed in the study were also likely to grow stronger over longer periods , professor @entity83 suggested			0
‘ even small changes to an individual ’s personality traits or subjective well - being can have important consequences for the course of his or her life , ’ he said			2
‘ these findings challenge the common assumption that associations of personality traits with subjective well - being are entirely , or almost entirely , due to trait influences on well - being , ’ professor @entity83 concluded			2
the study was published in the @entity144 .			0

researchers from @entity12 compared personality traits to levels of well - being
outgoing people saw increased levels of happiness over a four - year period
yet as this happiness increased , outgoing participants became introverted
this suggests having lots of friends ultimately makes people less sociable and withdrawn - the opposite of what researchers had expected
they believe this is because people do *n't* feel the need to make new friends
