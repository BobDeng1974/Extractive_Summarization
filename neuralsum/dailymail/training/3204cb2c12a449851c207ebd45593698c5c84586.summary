all that fun buying a new frock can often be ruined by the torturous wait at a till to pay for it			0
but thanks to a new mobile phone app , you may never have to queue again			2
in fact , you may even be able to pay while you ’re trying on the clothes in the fitting room			0
the ‘ @entity16 ’ app from online payment firm @entity12 will allow shoppers to purchase goods on the shop floor in less than 30 seconds			1
@entity17 works by generating a barcode on screen , which the shop then scans to take money from the customer 's account the app is locked by a pin , and no financial details are stored in the phone itself shop assistants carry portable scanners which are used to read the barcodes on customers ’ goods wherever they are in store			1
shoppers then use their @entity12 app to enter a passcode , which produces a unique barcode on the screen of the phone			1
this second barcode is then scanned by a shop assistant , which completes the sale while avoiding the need to visit a conventional cash till			1
receipts are automatically sent to a shopper ’s email			0
it has been launched at 230 branches of fashion stores @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 today with more stores expected to accept the payments later this year			0
