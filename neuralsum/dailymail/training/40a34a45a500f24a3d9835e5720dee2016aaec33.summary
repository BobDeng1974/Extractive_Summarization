by @entity0 , political reporter @entity1 has taken industry experts by surprise , saying he wants fracking underway by the end of the year @entity6 has a duty to step up fracking to reduce dependence on gas from @entity10 , the prime minister said yesterday			1
@entity1 , who met world leaders to discuss the crisis in @entity13 , said the annexation of @entity15 was a ‘ wake up call ’ for @entity17 about its reliance on @entity10 energy			1
@entity20 supplies around a third of @entity17 ’s gas , much of it via a pipeline through @entity13 , and mr @entity1 said some countries are nearly 100 per cent reliant on @entity10 gas			1
he said he wanted some shale gas wells up and running by the end of the year , to encourage the idea of self - sufficiency in energy			0
but his call surprised industry experts , who said it would be the end of this decade before commercial fracking could begin			1
@entity6 gets most of its gas from the @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 but will need far more imports as @entity35 supplies dwindle			2
officially the @entity6 imports less than 1 per cent of its gas from @entity10			1
but @entity20 - owned firm @entity40 claims it could be as high as 15 per cent indirectly , as @entity6 ’s buys gas from other @entity17 countries such as @entity43 at peak times , which originates from @entity10			1
in 2009 , when @entity10 cut off the gas to @entity13 , @entity6 prices jumped by 17 per cent			1
@entity6 has vast reserves of shale gas trapped in rocks thousands of feet underground which can be extracted in the controversial fracking process			2
it got under way in @entity53 three years ago and had to be halted after two small earthquakes but has now re-started			0
exploratory drilling near the village of @entity57 , @entity58 , last year was abandoned after the site was overrun by protesters who believe fracking could ruin the countryside and contaminate water supplies			0
@entity64 did get underway in @entity57 , @entity65 , last year but was abandoned after protester flooded the site yesterday the prime minister said the military action by @entity10 meant that ‘ energy independence ’ should become ‘ a tier one political issue from now on , rather than tier five ’			0
asked whether it was @entity6 ’s duty to secure its energy independence by embracing fracking , he said : ‘ yes , i think it is			2
’ he added that one of the best ways of addressing ‘ people ’s uncertainties and worries ’ is to show them shale gas wells in action as soon as possible			0
‘ by the end of this year there should be some unconventional gas wells up and running that we can demonstrate and i think the enthusiasm for it will grow , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’m confident we ’ll win the argument			0
’ ministers are expected to hand out dozens of licences for shale gas drilling this summer , and a map of @entity6 ’s reserves suggests every county except @entity98 could see some drilling .			0

@entity1 says @entity6 has a duty to step up gas *production*
says @entity13 crisis was wake up call over reliance on @entity10 gas
but industry experts think it could be 2020 before wells are ready
