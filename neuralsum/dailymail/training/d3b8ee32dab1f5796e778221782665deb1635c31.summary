by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:06 pm on 12th january 2012 scam : @entity3 arrives at the @entity4 today where he admitted taking a bung to bowl badly so a certain number of runs could be scored a former @entity10 fast bowler has become the first @entity12 cricketer to admit his part in a match - fixing scam after pleading guilty to corruption at the @entity4 today			1
@entity3 , 23 , was paid £ 6,000 by a betting syndicate to bowl in a way that would allow a certain number of runs to be scored from his first over , the court heard			1
he admits accepting the money , but claims he did not carry out the request			2
the agreed number of runs was 12 , but only 10 were scored during his first six balls in the @entity28 game against @entity29 on september 5 , 2009			1
he also admitted he ‘ received numerous approaches ’ to concede runs for cash and was actually asked to fix a game			1
he claims he thought about the offers and declined			2
his barrister , @entity35 , told the hearing : ‘ a certain amount of runs were supposed to be given away in the first over that was bowled			1
’ the court heard the fixer who set up the spot - fixing scam is a well - known name in world cricket			1
judge @entity47 said : ‘ it seems the alleged corrupter is a person whose name is known to me and i ’m sure known to many people interested in cricket			1
’ @entity55 , of @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity10 , said he agreed to the scam and took the money to do so , but did not keep up his side of the bargain			2
he was caught when he ' unguardedly ' confessed to a fellow player			2
the case comes after world cricket was brought to its knees by a spot - fixing scandal which saw three @entity68 test players and their @entity70 agent jailed last year			1
caught out : @entity55 ( centre ) was arrested after confessing his indiscretions to a fellow player the plot involved two players deliberately bowling no balls at specific points in the match			1
mitigating for @entity55 , mr @entity80 , said : ‘ having had the money , he did his best to keep his side of the bargain , but failed			2
’ he said the cricketer was either unable to do as he agreed or was attempting to trap the fixers			0
‘ the aim was to snare for future activity , ' he added			0
' the reality is , on any view , he did n’t do what he was supposed to have done			0
‘ the case against @entity55 is based almost entirely on what he told fellow players			0
‘ of course , concentrating solely on the prosecution case for the moment , a certain amount of runs were supposed to have been given away in the first over that was bowled and they were n’t			1
‘ it is not just the defendant ’s word			0
there is certainly no evidence that he did			0
' in action : @entity55 celebrates a wicket for @entity108 during the @entity28 match against @entity110 in september 2009 neither the player to whom @entity55 confessed , nor the alleged corrupter were identified in court			0
mr @entity80 said @entity55 had no previous convictions , but accepted that the matter could result in a prison term			0
but he will argue his client should be given a suspended sentence when he returns to court on february 10 , he added			0
adjourning for sentence , judge @entity119 told @entity55 : ‘ i hold up no promises as to the eventual outcome of this case			1
‘ certainly it is open to the court in cases such as this to pass an immediate custodial sentence			0
’ @entity55 , whose father is due to undergo an operation for prostate cancer next week , was granted unconditional bail			0
a separate charge of assisting another person to cheat at gambling was ordered to lie on file			0
@entity55 is the first professional cricketer in @entity139 to face prosecution for his involvement in spot fixing in a @entity144 match , @entity137 said today			0
awaiting sentence : @entity55 ( pictured after his court appearance ) faces jail after admitting corruption charges			0
he has been released on unconditional bail a spokesman said that although it was centred on the domestic game , it would have ' far - reaching consequences ' for world cricket			1
the prosecution , which relates to a match played on september 5 , 2009 , involved the first use of @entity162 legislation within the context of a sporting event , the force said			0
a number of agencies assisted with the investigation , including the @entity168 , the @entity169 , @entity108 and the @entity70 @entity170			1
detective sergeant @entity171 , of @entity137 , said : ' we hope this sends a strong message to professional sportsmen and women around the country - if they intend to get involved in spot - fixing , or think that match - fixing is not a crime , they need to think again			1
' @entity182 , chief executive of the @entity183 , welcomed @entity55 's decision to enter a guilty plea			0
' i 'm not sure that court cases necessarily are very helpful , but the fact that he has admitted to the crime can only act as a signal to others that sport needs to be treated with respect and played properly , at any level , ' he said			1
' our view on it is that the world has moved on quite a long way since he committed those offences			1
' we 've invested a huge amount in educating players as to their responsibilities , but i think that none of us can be complacent			0
' i think that we are all very mindful of the need to make sure that sport is played properly			1
' behind bars : @entity208 cricketers ( left to right ) bowler @entity206 , bowler @entity209 and former captain @entity210 , who were jailed last year after being convicted of a spot - fixing scam that shocked world cricket asked if county players , who generally earn less than international cricketers , were especially susceptible to approaches , he said : ' i 'm not convinced that we know who the high - risk groups are			1
' there is no doubt that where there are threats of corruption they will be linked to gambling and that gambling will predominantly be on televised games			0
' international cricket certainly is a risk and i think domestic cricket is also a risk because some games are televised on the @entity236 sub-continent so i suppose those specific matches are the ones we need to worry about			2
' @entity55 was released by @entity108 and now plays club cricket for @entity241			2
last year , former captain @entity210 , 27 , plotted with pace bowlers @entity209 , 28 , and rising star @entity206 , 19 , to deliberately bowl three no balls at the @entity245 test against @entity139 in august 2010			2
@entity210 was jailed for 30 months ; @entity209 received 12 months and @entity206 was locked up for six months			2
