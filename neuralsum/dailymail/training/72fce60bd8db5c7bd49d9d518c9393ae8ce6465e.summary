by @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 political editor published : 07:56 est , 4 march 2013 updated : 20:58 est , 4 march 2013 @entity3 is sending his eldest son to one of the most over-subscribed state catholic schools in @entity7 – the same choice made by @entity9 for his children			1
the deputy prime minister ’s son , @entity13 , will attend the @entity14 from this autumn			2
mr @entity3 , who is an atheist , and his wife @entity16 chose the elite institution , which is just over two miles from their £ 1.6million @entity19 home , ahead of closer state schools – including two ranked as ‘ outstanding ’ by schools watchdog @entity21			1
@entity3 and wife @entity16 have chosen the @entity22 for their eldest son @entity23 to attend form september they had also considered the @entity29 leader ’s alma mater , the £ 23,000 - a - year @entity27 , but plumped for the state - funded school instead			1
@entity32 is @entity33 and @entity34 and the couple ’s three children are being raised in the faith			1
a spokesman for mr @entity3 said he and his wife were ‘ delighted ’ to get their son into the school			1
his decision to send his son to a state school comes after he was criticised for even considering educating his eldest child privately			1
and he will open himself up to accusations of hypocrisy after the @entity29 , in their 2010 general election manifesto , pledged to stamp out ‘ discrimination ’ in faith schools on grounds of belief			1
mr @entity3 ’s aides said the family felt ‘ lucky ’ to get in			0
when he first became party leader , mr @entity3 was asked if he believed in @entity57			1
he replied simply : ‘ no. ’ later he said he had ‘ enormous respect ’ for people with faith and added : ‘ i ’m married to a @entity34 and am committed to bringing my children up as @entity59			1
’ eleven - year - old @entity63 will attend the @entity22 school from september @entity32 is a @entity34 , and the couple 's three sons have been brought up as @entity59			1
mr @entity3 is an atheist under the school ’s strict criteria , at least one parent has to be a practising @entity34 before a child can be admitted and the pupil is expected to show involvement in the church			1
mr @entity3 ’s spokesman said : ‘ @entity3 married in a @entity59 , his children are @entity59 but he has never pretended he is anything other than an atheist			1
’ according to the @entity22 ’s website , there were more than 800 applications for the 2013 intake , and only 160 places allocated			0
siblings of existing pupils have a higher chance of getting in to the @entity86 , which is good news for the @entity88 as they have two younger sons , @entity90 , seven , and four - year - old @entity91			0
the @entity92 sent their sons , @entity94 and @entity95 , to the school			0
their daughter @entity97 is believed to have joined in the sixth form			0
last year , 97 per cent of sixth - formers gained three or more a-levels at grades a - e. in its last @entity21 report , in 2009 , the school was judged to be outstanding			0
the @entity3 family 's choice of education will make fewer headlines than if they had opted for a private school , but is not without controversy			2
former prime minister @entity9 attracted some criticism when he sent his two eldest sons , @entity95 and @entity94 , to the top - rated state school , while daughter @entity97 is believed to have joined in the sixth form			0
the school , which caters only for boys only up to age 16 , is extremely popular , and achieves good exam results			0
last year , 92 per cent of pupils scored at least five gcses at grade c or above , including @entity120 and maths , while 97 per cent of sixth - formers gained three or more a-levels at grades a * - @entity124 in its last @entity21 report , in 2009 , the school , which became an academy in 2011 , was judged to be outstanding overall			0
@entity22 is part of the @entity59 , and has strict criteria for pupils to meet when the school is over-subscribed			0
priority admission to youngsters who practise the faith , with the school looking firstly at how often the child and his parents attend mass , followed by whether the child fulfils the @entity59 's requirements on baptism , whether they have received their first @entity140 , and whether the child or a @entity34 parent has served in any @entity143 or the wider @entity59			1
a spokesman for mr @entity3 said : ' in response to media inquiries , @entity3 and @entity16 can confirm that they have decided to send their oldest son , @entity13 , from september onwards to the @entity14 , a state catholic secondary school			1
' he is currently a pupil at a state catholic primary school , @entity150 of the @entity151 in @entity19 , where he has been going for the last six years			0
' now that their decision has been made public , they hope that the privacy of their son will be respected			1
' however , it could prove controversial that the couple have secured a place at one of the most exclusive schools in the capital			2
mr @entity3 had previously hinted that the couple would choose a private school for their son			2
‘ if it works out to send them to a good state ( school ) we will do so but , like all parents sending their children to secondary school in @entity22 , as you know there is huge competition for places , ' he said last month			2
the deputy prime minister said he would put his children ’s education first and would not overrule the wishes of his wife or son for ‘ political reasons ’			1
it is thought the couple looked around several schools , including the @entity22 and a £ 30,000 - a - year independent school			2
education secretary @entity189 defended mr @entity3 , and insisted politicians had to do the right thing for their children			2
he said : ‘ @entity3 should send his son to the right school for his son			0
i would absolutely defend him whatever he chose to do			0
a parent 's first responsibility is to their child			0
@entity200 has insisted he is ‘ committed ’ to sending his eldest daughter @entity201 to a state school , as in @entity22 ‘ there ’s a real improvement taking place ’			0
when it emerged in 2010 that the couple were interested in the @entity22 , the headmaster @entity208 , said his school would be a ' natural choice ' for the couple , who were ' happy with what they saw '			2
the @entity29 leader previously insisted it was not ' entirely surprising ' that the family was looking at good state catholic schools			1
critics have suggested that other suitable schools are closer			0
the spokesman said @entity3 and mrs @entity32 had looked at options but it was a ' very common ' choice to attend the @entity86 from @entity13 's current primary school			0
' the reason why they are sending him to the oratory is quite simple - they think it is the best school for him , ' he added			0

@entity29 leader is an atheist but wife @entity16 is a practising @entity34
couple *fiercely* *protect* privacy of their children but came under *pressure* to make decision public
