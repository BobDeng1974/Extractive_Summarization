the @entity9 isometric views of the city on @entity12 's east coast appear to show many of its high - rise buildings looking rather is if they are about to topple over			2
the glitch was pointed out by @entity16 ( @ minutephysics ) on @entity18 this morning			0
he asked : ' was @entity19 designed by @entity20 ? ' surreal : @entity3 ' 45 - degree satellite view of downtown @entity4			1
@entity16 asked @entity18 this morning : ' was @entity19 designed by @entity20 ? @entity23 : @entity20 was a prominent @entity24 surrealist painter in many of whose artworks the normal laws of physics did not seem to apply the prominent @entity24 surrealist painter @entity20 was well known for fantastic artworks , in which the normal laws of physics do n't seem to apply			0
the same could be said for @entity3 's rendering of downtown @entity4 , where many of the buildings appear to defying gravity by leaning at odd angles relative to each other			1
the phenomenon appears to be a glitch in @entity3 ' 45 - degree view feature			1
comparison by @entity41 with other areas of high - rise development which are pictured with the view , including @entity45 , @entity46 , and @entity47 , shows the same glitch , but the effect is less obvious			2
@entity3 released the 45 - degree view imagery in its map product last september , with the initial roll - out featuring 51 cities with the feature			1
it was a response to the flyover feature in @entity59 's @entity58 app , which was slammed by users for its bizarre rendering of many areas			0
leaning towers : @entity3 released the 45 - degree view imagery in its map product last september , with the initial roll - out featuring 51 cities with the feature @entity45 , @entity46 : the same effect can be seen in the @entity68 @entity67 city to a lesser extent among the landmarks touted by @entity3 at the release of the 45 degree view was the world - famous @entity73 , a free - standing bell tower which has been actually tilting since before it was even finished			1
the tilt is due to its construction on an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to support the tower 's weight			0
@entity3 satellite images are not updated in real time and in most cases they are several months or years old			0
although @entity3 uses the word satellite , most of the high - resolution imagery of cities is aerial photography taken from aircraft flying at 800 â€“ 1500ft .			0

effect seems to be a glitch in @entity3 ' 45 degree view
buildings in @entity4 's downtown area seem to defy gravity
other areas show the same effect to a lesser extent
