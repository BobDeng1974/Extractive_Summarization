@entity0 have increased the pressure on @entity2 to ease the tax burden on millions of middle - class @entity4 @entity0 will today pile pressure on @entity2 to ease the tax burden on millions who have been sucked into the higher 40p rate of income tax			1
the @entity11 party is proposing a new 35p rate to be levied on earnings between £ 42,000 and £ 55,000 , arguing many middle - class families on such incomes are being unfairly squeezed			1
it will also float the idea of a ‘ turnover tax ’ – a minimum percentage of companies ’ annual turnover that has to be paid to the @entity22 – to crack down on large - scale tax avoidance			1
@entity0 says the £ 2.5 billion a year cost of a new 35p income tax rate should also be met by cutting the foreign aid budget , ending contributions to @entity28 by exiting the @entity29 , slashing funding to @entity31 and scrapping the new high speed rail line @entity32			1
it will also back a @entity36 policy to increase the starting rate for income tax further to £ 12,500 , bringing it broadly in line with the minimum wage			1
chancellor @entity2 has targeted support at more than 20 million basic rate taxpayers , despite calls from the @entity44 for him to do more for middle class families who have been dragged into the 40p rate			1
a dramatic and expensive increase in the personal allowance from £ 6,475 to £ 10,500 means that since 2010 almost three million people have been lifted out of paying income tax			1
for the average taxpayer , it will amount to paying over £ 700 a year less in income tax compared to when the @entity54 took power			1
the @entity22 says anyone earning up to around £ 120,000 has seen at least some overall benefit from the higher starting rate of tax			1
however , the numbers dragged into paying the higher 40p income tax is expected to rise from three million in 2010 to 4.9million by the time of next year ’s election			2
in 1978 , only three per cent of taxpayers paid tax at the higher rate			2
by next year it will be approaching 20 per cent			0
normally , the 40 per cent higher - tax threshold rises in line with inflation to take into account rises in the cost of living			2
but from april 2014 , the point at which higher rate tax is paid is to rise by a flat 1 per cent for two years instead			0
this lower rise in the threshold means more workers will be caught in the 40 per cent net			0
@entity80 's party will announce it wants to cut income tax for middle - earning families at its conference @entity0 economics spokesman @entity84 , who will propose a new 35p rate at his party ’s annual conference today said : ‘ this is a massive blind spot for the coalition , and for @entity2 in particular			1
he has given the very highest earners a tax cut , and we agree that 50p was too high as a top rate			2
‘ but he seems to think that tax discincentives only really apply to the very wealthiest			2
it ’s incredible that a @entity44 chancellor after half a decade in office is going to go into an election with a 40p threshold that ’s actually lower than the one he inherited from a @entity103 chancellor			0
those on these incomes are aspirational people , many of whom started with very little			0
they are by no means rich			0
traditionally they might have thought the @entity44 party would back them , certainly in the days of @entity113			0
‘ yet they have seen @entity2 penalise them			0
’ official figures , from @entity117 , show there were just three million higher rate taxpayers when the coalition came to power in may 2010			0
an analysis by the @entity123 ’ @entity124 shows the starting salary for higher rate tax would currently be £ 63,777 if it had been uprated each year in line with earnings			2
conservative mp @entity129 has led calls for the @entity22 to act to help those on the higher rate			0
he said the government needed to ‘ ease the squeeze on the middle classes ’			0
mr @entity84 said @entity0 would also ask the @entity22 to examine the feasibility of a ‘ turnover tax ’ to reduce large scale tax avoidance , and at what level it might be set			1
‘ it would act as a backstop for the tax system , so that every major company would be measured on whether it had paid a set proportion of turnover in corporation or other taxes , ’ he said .			0
