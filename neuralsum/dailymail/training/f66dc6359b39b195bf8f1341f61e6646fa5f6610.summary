champions @entity0 left @entity2 on sunday with the bonus - point victory they needed to reignite their title defence , but also with fitness concerns over two @entity7 forwards			1
@entity9 ’s side had this @entity11 non-contest wrapped up within the first half - hour with three tries			1
yet they had to wait until two minutes from time to secure the bonus , when @entity16 crossed in the left corner following @entity19 defiance			1
for the @entity21 , this was a fitting response to the setback of losing at @entity23 — at least in terms of the scoreline , as the performance was patchy			1
it also leaves them set fair for a momentous showdown with @entity30 at @entity31 on saturday			2
@entity16 breaks forward to secure a bonus point win for reigning champions @entity21 defending champions @entity21 returned to winning ways with 35 - 10 victory over @entity19 there are a few scattered clouds in the brighter skies over @entity0 , however , caused by medical concerns			1
@entity7 flanker @entity41 was withdrawn from the match with a bad back , while @entity45 team - mate @entity44 retired soon after half - time clutching his left shoulder			1
in addition , @entity48 is sidelined with a persistent calf injury			2
as ever , the official line suggested no reason to panic , but only time will tell			0
@entity9 said : ‘ @entity41 has got a sore back			2
he actually got it against @entity56 , so he played last week with it			0
it ’s been bothering him all week so we thought we would n’t risk it			0
i ’m pretty comfortable that he and @entity44 will be fine for next week			2
‘ @entity44 just got a stinger in that last two minutes of defence in the first half			2
he put in a big tackle and just took a blow to the shoulder			0
’ @entity66 ( @entity67 ) of @entity21 makes a break during the @entity11 match for @entity19 , this was a 19th successive league defeat , stretching back to october last year			1
the manner of their second - half resurgence was reason for measured optimism , but what @entity77 ’ team desperately need is a positive result , whatever the nature of the performance			0
in the first 30 minutes their defending was dreadful			0
saints ’ first try came when three tacklers fell away as @entity85 ran to the line unchecked , while @entity87 allowed @entity88 to breeze past him and set up a try for @entity90			1
the @entity19 rallied with sufficient conviction after half - time to secure long spells of attacking possession , which led to a try by @entity95 from a quick tap penalty on the right			2
but by then the damage was done			0
@entity100 of @entity0 powers through the @entity19 defence of @entity102 and @entity103 @entity104 lamented the slow start , saying : ‘ the way we turned up in the first 30 minutes was n’t great			1
we fronted up in the second half but i wish we had done that in the first half			0
‘ our exits were n’t great , we did n’t do what we said we were going to do and our work - rate was woeful			0
once we showed some belief we were a match for them in the final 50 minutes			0
’ @entity0 did enough to take what they wanted from this game without ever really hitting their peak , although there was slick play between @entity88 and @entity121 in the build - up to @entity124 ’s try			1
@entity125 ran with menace from full back and @entity85 showed some assured touches as the playmaker deputising for @entity48			1
@entity130 ( @entity67 ) of @entity19 is tackled @entity44 of @entity21 however , the @entity21 will have to be far more precise and ruthless against @entity30 , as they are well aware			1
‘ @entity30 are running hot at the moment , ’ said @entity131 — no pun intended			1
‘ they are a team in form			0
we all watched their game against @entity138 ( which @entity30 won 45 - 0 ) and we know it ’s going to be tough next weekend			1
’ @entity9 added : ‘ we ’ve respected @entity30 over the last few years			2
we had three really close games with them last season — we drew down there and just beat them in the @entity145 final			0
‘ they are a developing team and to beat any side by 40 - odd points , particularly @entity138 , means you have to respect them			0
‘ they ’ve got threats all over the field , but we ’ve got a few threats of our own			0

@entity0 defeated @entity19 35 - 10 in @entity11 game
saints responded well to loss against @entity23 while @entity19 *winless* run stretches to 19 games
will @entity85 , @entity124 , @entity90 and @entity16 starred for defending champions
there are injury concerns over @entity41 , @entity44 and @entity48
@entity131 warns @entity21 will have to be better against @entity30
