he is @entity1 ’s weapon of mass distraction , capable of overpowering sporting rivals through thunderous scoring streaks and sheer force of will			1
the problem for @entity8 is that @entity9 may be as liable to blow up in the silo as hit an opposition target here at @entity13			1
a shining example of both the strengths and weaknesses of @entity1 golf , his trash - talking individual style making him a ferocious competitor but perhaps not the greatest team player , the @entity24 rookie ’s already - notorious sense of self has prompted some to ask whether anyone in this @entity1 team will actually want to partner @entity9			1
if that sounds harsh , consider that @entity9 ’s team - mates at @entity30 once reportedly held a vote among themselves – and decided that possibly the most talented player any of them had ever seen should be removed from the squad			1
@entity9 has the talent to beat anyone at the @entity24 , but could also implode for the @entity1 @entity9 's trash - talking style has made him a ferocious competitor but not necessarily the greatest team player now , the 24 - year - old has obviously matured from the kid who had to change schools in order to become the driving force behind @entity45 ’s remarkable back - to - back @entity44 titles			1
yet there is a suspicion that the unruly – unmanageable ? – streak is still in there , constantly battling with the unmistakeably terrifying talent we ’ll see in action this week			2
recalling his move to @entity45 , his then - coach @entity54 remembers speaking to @entity9 ’s head of programme at @entity57 , @entity58			1
‘ he told me : “ you ’re going to have your hands full			0
@entity9 can really play - but he needs constant monitoring ” , ’ revealed @entity54 , who later suspended @entity9 for two unspecified violations of team rules in 2009			1
‘ @entity9 already thought he was twice as good as he really was			1
’ former @entity30 team - mate @entity65 added : ‘ he shot his mouth off early when he should n’t have			1
’ fortunately for @entity9 , it transpired that he had the game to back up the talk			1
the 24 - year - old , however , says the @entity24 is completely different and that he 's ready to be a team player one college acquaintance recalls bombing a drive 275 yards down the middle of a fairway , celebrating appropriately , then watching in astonishment as @entity9 got down on his knees – and , from that kneeling position , hit one 10 yards further			1
on best behaviour on thursday , the man who raised so many hackles by describing himself as ‘ top five - player in the world ’ earlier this year refuted accusations that he ’s not a team player , the world no 27 insisting : ‘ did it upset me ? no , i let a lot of things go and brush it off my shoulder			1
‘ @entity92 is an individual sport			0
i go to the golf course on a normal basis , i get out there in the morning , i pop in my headphones just to kind of get myself focused on to what i ’m trying to do while i ’m out there			0
‘ this week is completely different			0
this week , we have had so much fun with all the guys			0
just a lot of activities we ’ve been doing and all that kind of stuff			0
‘ when you play a normal @entity111 event , it ’s a lonely sport , but here it ’s totally different and i feel like the camaraderie that we have as a team is very high			1
i feel like the excitement and just the fun aspect that we ’ve had , it ’s been amazing			0
’ @entity9 and his partner @entity119 leave the @entity24 opening ceremony on thursday at @entity13 intriguingly , @entity9 names @entity122 as one of the three players he ’d pick to make up his dream fourball , explaining that he ’d had an enormous amount of fun playing with him on the @entity128			1
‘ he made you laugh literally the entire 18 holes we played , it was always just one - liners and jabbing a little bit , ’ he explained			2
‘ he was a lot of fun , real down - to - earth and easy to play with			2
i felt like if i spent some more time with him , ( i would ) get a couple more laughs and play some good golf			2
’ asked the obvious question about whether facing off against @entity144 talisman @entity122 would be quite as light - hearted this week , @entity9 deadpanned : ‘ @entity146			1
’ it should n’t be a surprise that he likes the brash @entity149 , though			0
@entity122 is a guy who works best when he makes a borderline outrageous statement – and then forces himself to back it up			2
@entity9 , who built up a remarkable unbeaten record in college matchplay , certainly enjoys this format , saying he ’d feel confident of promising captain @entity8 a point any time he went on course			1
‘ i think every guy on our team would , ’ he said			0
‘ all of us are confident , all of us feel like we ’re playing really well			0
‘ i ’ve absolutely loved watching the @entity24 since i was a little kid			2
my father used to play golf , so it did n’t matter whether it was played in the @entity164 or played over here , it was on the tv			0
‘ whether i was up at two or three in the morning , we were always watching it			0
it was one of those things that i ’ve always dreamed of making the team , and finally making the team means a lot			0
hopefully we can do our job and hopefully the @entity24 comes back home			2
‘ i was 6 - 0 in matchplay throughout my career			0
i played a lot of things in college because , at @entity30 , half the team was international and half the team was @entity1 — so we played multiple times a year in a @entity24 kind of a format and events like that			1
those are just the kind of things i feel like are going to help me this week			0
‘ i love being the underdog and kind of the team that ’s not really expected to win			0
i mean , @entity30 , did you expect us to win two in a row ? we still did it			0
’ @entity9 ( left ) takes in a practice round ahead of the tournament with experienced @entity1 team member @entity197 @entity9 ’s take on captain @entity8 is simple and honest enough , the rookie saying of the living legend : ‘ he gets it			1
’ as for advice the great man has passed on , the three - time @entity128 winner revealed : ‘ he just said be yourself , play your own game			2
’ the second part of that may be enough to beat anything @entity144 have to offer , up to and including @entity211			2
in a contest where par - fives are often crucial , @entity9 ’s power and accuracy — stats fan @entity214 should look away from his numbers on approaches from 200 yards - plus — could be the decisive factor			1
as for whether he ’ll work and play well with the others in red , white and blue ? if he ’s winning points for the team , that ’ll be a lot easier			2
he certainly wo n’t be hiding in the corner of the team room , whatever happens out on the course			0
‘ @entity9 ’s never been the type of player who ’s going to go anywhere quietly , ’ said one former team - mate			1
it is certainly likely that this noisy @entity233 will do some damage here			0
to whom , exactly , remains to be seen .			0

@entity9 is known as much for his comments as his talent
despite being the most talented , the now @entity1 star 's college team - mates once voted he be removed from their squad
*pundits* wondered if anyone would want to play with the cocky 24 - year - old
@entity9 was on his best behaviour on the eve of the @entity24 at @entity13
he 's been paired with @entity251 against @entity122 - @entity252
@entity9 said @entity144 's @entity122 would make his dream fourball team
