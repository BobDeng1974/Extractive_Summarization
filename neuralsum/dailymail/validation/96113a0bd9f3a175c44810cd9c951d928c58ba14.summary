fewer families are taking holidays during term time in the wake of a government crackdown on absenteeism , new figures suggest			0
the number of days missed by holidaying pupils decreased by almost a third in the past year after a ban on taking children out of lessons for trips			1
parents have been fined up to £ 1,000 and even taken to court since the new policy came into force in september 2013			0
drop : figures reveal just 3million school days were missed by pupils last year - down 1.4million on 2012 - 13 yesterday , @entity20 figures showed 3million days were missed for holidays in 2013 - 14 , down from 4.4million in 2012 - 13			1
the latest figure represents a decrease of more than two fifths from 2009 - 10 , when 5.3million days were missed			1
government statisticians said the drop has been fuelled by a fall in the number of authorised breaks - trips approved by the school			2
there has been a slight rise in the number of unauthorised holidays - indicating that some parents may be deciding to take their child out of school without permission , and instead run the risk of a fine			2
the latest figures , for the last academic year , are the first to show the impact of strict new rules on pupil absence introduced by former education secretary @entity45			2
under the changes , heads are now only able to grant leave in ‘ exceptional circumstances ’ and parents can be fined £ 60 per pupil for taking term time holidays without permission			1
the cost rises to £ 120 if it is not paid within 21 days			0
fines : the drop is being credited on the new fines system , which sees parents landed with a £ 60 penalty if they take their children out of school for an ' unauthorised ' absence those who fail to pay can face prosecution , with a maximum fine , if convicted , of £ 2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months			1
the @entity67 released guidance stating exceptions could be made for family funerals and religious events , but family holidays were unlikely to meet the criterion			0
campaigners have said the rules impact the hardest on poorer families who can not afford high travel costs during school breaks , and families with parents that work shifts on or rosters			1
travel companies increase their prices significantly in peak seasons when there is more demand			0
school reform minister @entity89 said : ‘ every single lost day counts - which is why as part of our plan for education we have put teachers back in charge so they can clamp down on classroom absence			0
‘ fewer school days are being lost than ever before thanks to our reforms - giving children the best possible chance to succeed			0

three million days missed last year , say @entity20 figures
number down from 4.4million in 2012 - 13 , and 5.3million in 2009 - 10
drop comes after fine of £ 60 per pupil brought in for missing school
but campaigners say measures impact the hardest on poorer families
