an @entity1 woman has become the first adult to undergo an operation to insert magnets in her back to combat a severe curvature of her spine			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , spent 30 years in pain after being diagnosed with scoliosis			1
surgeons performed the pioneering @entity15 rod operation on the 34 - year - old , inserting magnetic rods into her spine			1
the procedure , also known as the magnetic expansion control system , involves screwing the rods into the spine			1
the rods can then be controlled externally in order to correct the curvature of the spine			1
up until now the £ 15,000 operation has only been performed on children , as it was only thought to be effective for early onset scoliosis - typically diagnosed before the age of 10			1
right , after surgery the 34 - year - old was diagnosed as a newborn and underwent her first operation when she was just six weeks old			1
the condition , which causes an abnormal curvature of the spine , caused miss @entity8 's spine to bend in the shape of a ' c ' , curved at 130 degrees , left			1
since her operation she is standing tall for the first time , right following the success of miss @entity8 's surgery , specialists are now hopeful the bone implant will help other adults , many of whom have undergone a number of unsuccessful and painful invasive operations in an attempt to straighten and lengthen their spine			1
' the operation has completely changed my life , ' miss @entity8 said			1
' before , i could only walk short distances without being in pain but now i love to walk everywhere			0
' after more than 30 years of operations and taking painkillers , i 'm finally hopeful for the future			0
' when she was just six weeks old , miss @entity8 underwent her first operation			1
she was diagnosed with congenital scoliosis , which affects around one in 10,000 newborn babies			1
her spine was so malformed that doctors warned she would n't live past the age of seven			0
over the next ten years , she underwent eight painful operations as doctors battled to save her life			2
beating the odds , miss @entity8 survived childhood and trained at college to become a teacher			2
but the secondary effects of her scoliosis eventually left her unable to work			0
she said : ' because my spine was curved at 130 degrees , it formed into a c - shape and my lungs did n't have room to expand so they never grew to full size			1
' at my worst , my lungs were operating at only 30 per cent of what they should have been			0
' this meant that i was constantly poorly with pneumonia and chest infections			0
doctors said they did n't know what else they could do			0
' things got so bad that my doctor told me that if he did n't operate , i 'd be dead within 10 years			0
' although @entity15 rod technology has existed since 2011 , doctors initially did n't see it as an option for miss @entity8 as it had previously only been performed on children			1
the pioneering @entity15 rod operation involves surgeons inserting magnetic rods , pictured , screwing them into the patient 's spine doctors are then able to externally control the magnetic rods to help straighten the spine ( stock picture ) however , after running out of options , doctors decided to operate			1
@entity112 in @entity113 was able to secure funding from the @entity115 ( @entity115 ) and the 34 - year - old underwent the three - hour operation in june last year			1
over the following months , her spine was straightened at regular intervals			0
magnetic @entity121 treatment is a way of straightening a curved spine			2
it works by inserting an adjustable magnetic growing rod into a patients back			2
this can then be controlled using an external control - this avoids the need for further surgery			2
the internal rod is lengthened using the magnetic remote control outside the body			2
this means the spine can be very gradually straightened			0
usually , the patient is required to return to hospital about every six weeks to have their spine straightened by a few more millimetres			2
this process continues until the patient has reached their final height			0
until now the procedure has only be performed on children , with experts believing it would only be successful in those patients who are newly diagnosed with scoliosis			1
now fully recovered , miss @entity8 says she is looking forward to a healthy , happy future with her boyfriend , solicitor @entity153 , 32			2
' i 'm no longer in pain , and i feel so much more confident in myself , ' she said			0
' even little things like being able to wear pretty dresses or sit comfortably have made such a change			0
' i feel so lucky to have been able to have this operation - it really has changed my life			2
' before my dad passed away in 2009 , he told me that he hoped i 'd one day get my dream of living a normal life			0
i just hope i 'm making him proud			0
' consultant orthopaedic surgeon at @entity112 , doctor @entity168 , said : ' this is a big step forward for us			0
' the largest benefit of @entity15 rod technology is that it removes the need for repeat operations			1
' with the rod , once the initial procedure has been carried out , the patient does n't have to undergo any more incisions			2
' the spine is straightened externally using a remote control , which is painless and is performed without anaesthesia			0
' this in turn minimises the risk of infection and limits the impact of the procedure on the patient			0
' scoliosis comes from the @entity191 word ' skoliosis ' which means ' crooked '			0
symptoms of the condition include a curved spine , prominent ribcage or shoulder blades and uneven arm and leg lengths			0
miss @entity8 , with her boyfriend @entity200 , underwent the three - hour operation in june last year			1
scoliosis comes from the @entity191 word ' skoliosis ' which means ' crooked ' she said : ' i 'm no longer in pain , and i feel so much more confident in myself			0
i feel so lucky to have been able to have this operation - it really has changed my life ' it is estimated that 273 million people worldwide suffer from the condition , including @entity214 runner @entity213			0
in the @entity216 alone , approximately 45,000 children have scoliosis , with many having to undergo up to 20 corrective surgeries during their lifetime - at a massive £ 20,000 per procedure			1
the @entity15 rod , which is manufactured in @entity221 by @entity222 , aims to not only change lives , but also cut costs by removing the need for repeat surgeries			1
vice president of @entity222 , @entity228 , said : ' magnetic rod technology has really revolutionised the treatment of scoliosis			1
' analysis shows that eliminating the need for repeat surgeries reduces cost dramatically			0
' thanks to the success of @entity8 's operation , we are hopeful that the operation will be performed on more adults and help to change their lives too			2
' @entity241 , national director of the @entity242 and the @entity243 , added : ' to my knowledge , @entity8 is the first adult to have this operation			1
' it 's certainly a very innovative way of using technology that was originally designed for children between the ages of six and 11			0

@entity8 was diagnosed with scoliosis as a newborn baby
at six weeks old she underwent the first of many operations on her spine
after three decades of living in pain with a 130 degree ' c ' shaped spine surgeons decided to try the pioneering @entity15 rod operation last june
it involves screwing magnetic rods into the spine which can then be controlled externally to correct the curvature and straighten the spine
until now the procedure was only thought to be *suitable* for children
experts say they believe 34 - year - old is the first adult to benefit
