@entity1 manager @entity0 said he was unfazed by his side 's staggeringly low possession stat during the 1 - 0 win over @entity5 and all that mattered to him was achieving a positive result			1
the @entity9 , who secured victory through forward @entity13 's first - half strike , held the ball for just 29 per cent of the match at @entity16 - their lowest total over 90 minutes since @entity18 started recording this sort of data in 2006			1
@entity5 were also able to string together over 400 more successful passes than the home side			0
@entity0 , though , insisted that his team 's priority was to win the game and not concern themselves with statistics			2
presented with @entity5 's dominance of possession , the @entity29 responded passionately			2
@entity1 manager @entity0 says he is unconcerned by statistics and only cares about getting results @entity0 gestures on the touchline as he watches his side beat @entity5 1 - 0 at @entity16 @entity1 forward @entity13 ( left ) dribbles with the ball ahead of @entity39 's @entity38 ( right ) hazard celebrates scoring the only goal against @entity5 as @entity1 edge towards the league title ' they could have 99 ( per cent )			1
it was no problem , ' he said			0
' when you decide to play the game strategically , you do n't care about stats , you just care about the points			0
' with @entity1 's last seven league victories all coming by a single goal margin , it would be hard to argue @entity0 is anything but sincere			1
he continued : ' we were very well prepared for this game			0
we were able to make some of their important players disappear			0
' indeed , @entity0 's bold decision to play @entity60 in an enforcing midfield role really paid off to stifle @entity5 's attack			2
@entity1 's win over the @entity64 sees them extend their lead at the top of the @entity68 table to 10 points			1
@entity0 's men could wrap up the title as early as april 29 , should they win their next two games against @entity73 and @entity74			2
@entity1 have not won the @entity68 since 2010 under former boss @entity76 , but given their lead at the top and with only six games left to go , it would take a brave man to bet against them missing out this term			0
hazard , in particular , has impressed for the @entity9 throughout the campaign and is being hotly tipped to win the @entity84 award			0
