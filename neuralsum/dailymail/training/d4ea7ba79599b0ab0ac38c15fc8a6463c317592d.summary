‘ chapter one … he adored @entity2 ’			0
so goes the opening line of @entity5 ’s cult hit , @entity6			0
but despite the film 's reputation as a classic ode to @entity2 , the grittier neighbourhoods of @entity8 clearly were n't on the auteur 's radar when he penned his masterpiece a quarter of a century ago			1
@entity15 in @entity16 is at the centre of the @entity8 revolution , which has seen an influx of young urbanites , fashionistas and bearded hipsters relocating to the borough @entity24 might have provided a sugar - coated view of the city during the 1990s			1
but the thought of one of the fashion - obsessed singletons living amongst the industrialised suburbs was enough to make @entity32 choke on her cosmopolitan			0
the once run - down borough , for so long a destination solely to be passed through to get from @entity6 to @entity35 , now caters for the young urbanites , fashionistas as well as bearded hipsters who have been priced out of the city			2
it is also home to a fair few celebrities who have followed the middle - classes , with @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity47 actor @entity46 all residents of the borough			2
even @entity50 herself is said to be house hunting in the area			2
so , despite being well behind the times , i finally decided to see what all the fuss was about and join the crowds flocking over the @entity59 for a dose of shabby - chic glamour , foodie heaven and cutting edge bars			2
one of the most spectacular views of the @entity2 skyline is offered by the @entity66 – a vibrant , boutique establishment set in the heart of @entity16 sheltering @entity69 , the @entity71 - themed rooftop lounge set on the hotel ’s eighth floor , is open all year round and allows guests to enjoy one of the most breath - taking views of @entity6 the @entity80 - inspired pool at the @entity82 hotel has been described as the ‘ ultimate urban retreat ’ @entity16 is the neighbourhood leading the borough 's meteoric revolution , and thankfully for all the @entity87 they do n't have to stray too far from their spiritual home to get there			1
just one stop on the subway from @entity2 's @entity92 , the lively @entity15 is at the epicentre of the area 's transformation from a tough inner - city neighbourhood to @entity98 paradise			1
while you might not find a @entity101 boutique here just yet , you could probably pick up a second - hand pair from the myriad of vintage stores and flea markets springing up inside former factory buildings and derelict warehouses			0
renowned clothes store @entity110 in nearby @entity111 is a must for fashion enthusiasts , while the weekend - only indoor market artists and @entity115 provides the perfect introduction to the growing collection of @entity119 locals selling handmade arts and craft items , jewellery and retro clothing			0
there is no doubting the buzz around @entity16 , now referred to by locals as simply the ‘ @entity126 and if the wealth of cocktail bars lining the streets of @entity16 is n't enough to tempt @entity87 over the river , then the rooftop bars and boutique hotels certainly will be			1
one of the most spectacular views of @entity2 's skyline is offered by the @entity66 – a vibrant , boutique establishment set slap - bang in the heart of the action			1
sheltering @entity69 , the @entity71 - themed , rooftop lounge set on the hotel ’s eighth floor , is open all year round and allows guests to enjoy one of the most breath - taking panoramic views back over the @entity59 towards the city			2
the hotel 's location provided the perfect base for bar - hopping during our week - long trip , and ringing in the @entity155 at this intimate bar was among the highlights of our visit			0
i ’m told this 64 - room hotel has thrown some legendary parties , attracting a-list guests such as @entity163 , while the hotel ’s @entity80 - inspired pool area has been described as the ‘ ultimate urban retreat ’			0
@entity8 's illustrious brewing heritage has been revived following the introduction of the @entity169 in 1988			1
it has become such a staple part of @entity8 life that it now offers free tours of its premises despite the rapid gentrification that has transformed @entity8 , there is still a nod to the area ’s rich history			1
before prohibition , the borough boasted 48 breweries and its illustrious heritage has more recently been revived following the introduction of the @entity169 in 1988			0
the brewery , which supplies many of the alehouses and craft beer bars in @entity8 , has become such an integral part of the area 's transformation that it now even offers free tours			1
if any better evidence were needed of the area ’s change in fortunes it comes from the brewery ’s owners , who proudly declare : ‘ it used to be that we 'd be lucky to cobble together 15 brave souls to visit the wilds of @entity16 on a saturday afternoon			1
‘ now we 're happy to report that the brewery hosts a bustling crowd of beer enthusiasts , neighbours , tourists and all sorts of thirsty people all week long			0
’ @entity8 's artists and @entity115 vintage market is open at weekends and sells jewellery , retro clothing and hand - made arts and crafts the artists and fleas market at 70 north 7th street is one of many vintage retailers springing up around @entity8 yes , i know i ’m slightly late to the @entity8 party			1
but such is the rapid transformation of the area , that when i last visited @entity2 three years ago , the borough was n't yet considered worthy of making it on to the itinerary			1
typically , by the time it established itself on the tourist map the trendsetters were already championing the neighbouring borough of @entity230 as @entity2 ’s latest hotspot			0
but there ’s no doubting the buzz around @entity16 , now referred to by locals as simply the ‘ @entity126			1
@entity8 's lively @entity15 is situated just one stop away from @entity6 's @entity92 - or a 10 - minute taxi ride over the @entity59 @entity8 's restaurant of the moment is undoubtedly @entity239 ’s pizza parlour , situated in the shadow of the borough 's former factories and warehouses @entity244 does n't offer reservations and diners are frequently queuing around the block to be seated @entity249 coffee shops , organic stores and flea markets have now taken the place of old factory buildings in @entity8 @entity254 and rapper @entity255 have already pledged their allegiance to the @entity258 basketball team , snubbing @entity6 rivals the @entity259			1
the pair are regularly seen in the crowd at the nearby @entity263 arena in @entity264			0
perhaps most importantly , the local food scene in @entity8 has exploded and now ranges from the three @entity267 - starred @entity266 , to experimental @entity270 kitchen @entity268 , a miniature 380sq - ft foot diner hidden among the backstreets			1
the rather unconventional brunch menu of seafood and ramen dishes served at its four - stool counter might not be to the taste of those who hanker after traditional @entity2 fare offered up by the local delis , cafes and bagel shops			0
but for those who like their food piled high , @entity283 offers classic soul food such as fried chicken , waffles and maple syrup and shrimp and grits			0
the local food scene has exploded , and now includes experimental @entity270 kitchen @entity268 , a backstreet @entity294 diner serving an rather unconventional brunch menu at its four - stool counter @entity8 is mostly low - rise buildings , and has a much more residential , small - town feel compared to the towering skyline and fierce pace of @entity6 however , @entity8 's restaurant of the moment is undoubtedly @entity239 ’s pizza parlour			1
set among the industrial parks and abandoned warehouses of east @entity16 , naturally this hipster hangout is far too cool to offer reservations			2
instead , diners queuing patiently around the block is a common sight at weekends			0
arcade games from the 1980s have been installed at @entity312 , while artisan coffee shops , upmarket delis , fromageries and second - hand book stores are now in plentiful supply			0
@entity8 is mostly low - rise buildings , and has a much more residential , small town feel compared to the towering skyline and fierce pace of @entity6			2
i 'm told that good weather brings residents out onto their stoops , while local artists routinely set up stalls selling their fare on the sidewalks			0
@entity8 was well off the tourist map during the 1970s , when the area was primarily a working class borough and , of course , no cultural revolution is complete without the addition of the latest fitness fads			1
it was in 2013 that the luxury indoor cycling studio @entity338 opened its first branch in @entity16			2
the popular workout classes , which also have branches in @entity342 and @entity6 , have built up an impressive celebrity following over the years and now count @entity344 and @entity345 among their most committed members			0
