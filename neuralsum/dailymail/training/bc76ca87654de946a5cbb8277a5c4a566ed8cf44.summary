for months the awe - inspiring display of poppies which filled the moat at @entity3 has wowed the nation - while also tugging at the heart strings of the millions who visited it			1
but today the display was reduced to mud swept lands and seas of brown after volunteers removed the final flowers leaving nothing behind but a patch of trampled earth			2
the artwork , devised by @entity19 who also did work for the @entity21 , served as a site of pilgrimage for the five million people who saw it before @entity26 paid tribute to its war dead this @entity29 , 100 years since the outbreak of the @entity31			1
while the work is unlikely to ever be brought together in its entirety again , the @entity55 section - which poured from one of the @entity3 's windows - and the @entity56 - which vaulted over the @entity3 's entrance - will stay in place for the rest of this month before being toured around the @entity26 until 2018			2
meanwhile mr @entity19 and fellow artist @entity77 have been tipped to receive obes for services to the arts in the @entity82 's new year honours list			1
mr @entity19 previously spoke about how the memorial display was inspired by an unknown soldier from his home town and by a poem , the first line of which reads : ' the blood swept lands and seas of red , / where angels dare to tread '			2
seas of brown : a workman inspects the muddy moat at the @entity3 as volunteers removed the last of the poppies earlier today crowded out : around five million people visited the display in the run up to @entity103 - with the crowds so thick at one point that @entity107 tube station was shut - but they have all gone now special delivery : the poppies will now be packed up and sent off to buyers with the money being used to support the @entity51 easy does it : a volunteer carries one box of the ceramic flowers away from the @entity3 as the last of the poppies are removed he was also seriously injured in the making of the work , crushing his hand in a ceramic roller , leaving him with no middle finger and without the use of his index finger			1

’ the artist , who is studying for a phd at @entity189 , added : ‘ this is the biggest thing i have done			0
i am amazed that people have taken it to heart			0
