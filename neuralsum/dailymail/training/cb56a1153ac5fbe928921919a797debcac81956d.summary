by @entity0 @entity1 always knew she wanted to be a performer			1
as a child she would sing into her hairbrush in front of the mirror , make music videos of her favourite songs with her two sisters and put on variety shows for visitors to the house			0
but growing up in the small mining town of @entity15 in central @entity16 , her dream never seemed like it could become reality			0
so after school @entity1 , 25 , who did not wish to give her surname , studied a @entity20 and began working at day spas			2
she enjoyed her work at first , but when she moved to @entity23 she decided it was time to pursue her passion and so she learnt how to @entity26 ' i approached the manager of the local nightclub expressing my interest to learn how to dj. he was nice enough to let me come in after my day job when the club was closed to use the club 's decks and show me the basics â€¦ and eventually they let me stay back once the doors had opened and i djed in front of a crowd for the first time , ' she told @entity42			1
@entity1 transformed herself to become @entity43 when she realised her passion was djing @entity43 described herself as a ' shy quiet kid ' and a ' country girl ' who transforms into a fearless outgoing person when she is onstage since then , @entity48 , as she is now known , has become the resident dj at @entity49 on the @entity50 , toured at nightclubs around the country and performed shows in @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , as well as signing with an agency			1
@entity43 has transformed from a shy girl to a fearless performer who describes her sound as ' bounce and big room '			1
' i was always the shy quiet kid , even now sitting in a group of friends i am probably the quietest one			1
it actually takes me a lot of time to feel comfortable around someone and open up , ' she said			0
' however , when i 'm on stage , i 'm very outgoing , confident and fearless			2
i ca n't really explain it , i have always been like that from my early dancing days			0
' part of finding her confidence has come from finally doing something she loves			0
' i used to get really nervous right before going into the booth , but once i play the first track i 'm in my zone and the performer in me comes out , ' she said			0
the 25 - year - old has been touring nightclubs around the country and in @entity87 @entity43 describes her sound as ' bounce and big room ' her dream is to play at some of the world 's biggest music festivals and to release some original tracks not everyone understands her unorthodox career path			1
' my parents just thought it was a hobby at first , but once i started taking it seriously they seemed a bit worried			0
they would never stop me from going after what i love but i think they would prefer me to have a secure nine to five job , ' she said			0
but the opportunities presented to her as a @entity26 have been too good to pass up			2
in may she performed in front of more than 2,000 people at the @entity110 event in @entity54			2
' it was a super clubbing experience with a massive stage , elevated @entity26 booth , dancers and an amazing light show			2
i felt very loved and welcomed over there , ' she said			0
the @entity26 is looking forward to continuing to tour across @entity118 and has ambitions to release her own original track , perform on the main stage at some international festivals and to tour across the @entity124 and @entity125			1
the 25 - year - old would visit a nightclub after work each day to learn the craft before she was a dj , @entity1 studied beauty therapy in @entity16 @entity1 grew up in the small mining town of @entity15 , in central @entity16 where she was ' country girl '			1
