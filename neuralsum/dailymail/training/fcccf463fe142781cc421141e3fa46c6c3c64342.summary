by @entity0 published : 03:37 est , 27 august 2012 updated : 18:37 est , 27 august 2012 the deal to strip sir @entity2 of his major rail franchise could be signed by ministers tonight despite his last - ditch intervention yesterday			1
the @entity7 boss made a personal appeal to @entity9 to block the award of the @entity11 to rivals @entity12			2
speaking from his private @entity15 island of @entity16 , the billionaire claimed the contract process had been flawed in an outspoken television interview			2
blow : sir @entity2 's train company has lost its @entity11 franchise but has today vowed to run it for free if @entity22 manages to halt the contract being signed by @entity12 tomorrow he said the prime minister was ‘ the person that can really intervene to try to get some sense into the @entity27 ’			1
as mr @entity9 was on holiday , he called for a month ’s delay and even pledged to run the service for free if ministers launched a review			2
attack : @entity22 's @entity34 is leading @entity22 's charge to stop the contract being signed until mps return from their holidays next week @entity22 also called for a pause so the deal can be debated when mps return to @entity42 next week after their summer recess			1
but last night , the @entity27 insisted the 13 - year franchise was decided by a ‘ fair and established process ’			0
sources said transport secretary @entity47 could sign as early as midnight tonight			0
an insider said it would be ‘ unprecedented ’ to halt a commercial contract to allow a political debate			0
this would force @entity7 to take legal action or admit defeat after running the franchise for 15 years , a furious sir @entity2 claims @entity12 ’s £ 6.5billion bid will lead to ‘ almost certain bankruptcy ’			1
@entity12 chief executive @entity59 dismissed this , saying the sum was realistic and the contract had been won ‘ fair and square ’			1
@entity63 transport secretary @entity34 told her opposite number in a letter that the deal was driven by the ‘ bottom line ’ of how much would be paid			0
she warned there was a history of franchise contracts collapsing because of over-ambitious promises			0
more than 140,000 people – including @entity74 champion @entity73 , @entity75 and @entity76 – have backed an internet petition calling for the decision to be reversed			0
angry : sir @entity2 has been furious at the government 's decision not to renew his contract and has made several sensational pledges			1

@entity12 will sign the £ *10billion* contract tomorrow but @entity22 want it stopped until @entity85 returns from its summer break
meanwhile sir @entity2 offers to run @entity88 to @entity90 route without profit into 2013 to allow @entity92 time to *scrutinise* decision
