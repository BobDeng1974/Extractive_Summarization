by @entity0 published : 10:07 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 11:12 est , 6 august 2013 when it comes to dressing for a society occasion , @entity2 has protocol nailed			1
never is a hemline too short , or too flyaway , @entity5 is a hair in her remarkable bouffant out of place			0
styles that would look anachronistic on anyone else just seem to work on @entity2 ( maybe thanks , in part , to the fact that her hairstyle remains locked into 1963 )			2
and so to @entity16 today , where the annual regatta kicked off on the weekend			2
princess @entity2 arrived this morning in typically elegant attire , looking as though she had just stepped off the pages of a @entity22 catalogue			1
@entity43 - style trousers , preferably white			0
@entity44 and beige also acceptable , as are red or pink for gentlemen			0
shoes , as @entity2 demonstrates , should be a flat , deck shoe style			2
for @entity2 , something sensible and brown fits the bill ; others could make a splash with a pair of @entity56 ( as worn by the @entity57 on a boating outing last year ) , or @entity22 , an @entity60 company who have been making boat shoes since 1935			1
appropriate : @entity63 went for a traditional @entity65 look for her jaunt at @entity16 , paired with blue cotton trousers and a pair of canvas shoes day on the waves : @entity63 was out on the water with @entity73 sailor and @entity75 gold medallist @entity74 with a wealth of experience under her belt , @entity2 could well hand some style tips to the less experienced high profile guests of the regatta , though one such newbie - who also has links to the royal family - managed quite well on her own			1
@entity63 , the television presenter and erstwhile actress who is currently firmly in the public eye thanks to the fact she is dating the duchess of @entity91 's younger brother @entity90 , put in her own appearance at the @entity36 this morning			1
she chose a traditional @entity65 top paired with slate blue - grey cropped chinos and navy canvas shoes			0
so far so sensible ( @entity2 would approve )			0
donning an anorak bearing the logo of the regatta 's main sponsor , she took to a yacht to meet @entity75 sailor @entity74 , who took her through her paces onboard			0
looking perfectly ship - shape , she presented a slot to @entity106 television show in which she brought viewers up to date with the goings on at the event , which started on saturday 3 august and are set to come to a close on saturday 10 august			0
for more go to @entity111 online captain @entity112 ! @entity63 met multiple @entity75 medal - winning sailor @entity74 whilst visiting the regatta on day four of the @entity117 left : @entity118 , £ 80 , sperrytopsider.co.uk right : @entity121 shoe in pink suede , £ 65 , sperrytopsider.co.uk left : original @entity65 shirt , £ 29.95 , bretonshirt.co.uk @entity125 tux , £ 45 , riverisland.com			1
