by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 it was hard to spot a miserable @entity4 fan on sunday as the @entity5 won their second trophy inside three months following their 3 - 0 @entity8 victory over @entity9			1
the @entity5 dominated the traditional curtain raiser between the @entity12 winners and the @entity14 champions from start to finish , as @entity18 's side struggled to contain the rampant north @entity20 outfit			2
but what does the result mean for both teams over the course of the season ? as it turns out , it is n't much as @entity28 has put together 10 omens and stats which show how fortunes can change whether you win or lose the @entity34 curtain raiser			0
turning point ? @entity4 's @entity8 victory has good and bad omens for the @entity5 @entity4 keen to push on after victory in the @entity8 we 're gunner slip up at some point the last time @entity4 won the @entity8 and went on to take the ensuing top - flight title was 80 years ago in the 1934 - 35 season			1
title charge ahead for @entity44 ? @entity4 's win by three goals is the largest winning margin in the @entity8 since the @entity5 defeated @entity48 in 1998 - they would go on to challenge for the league title only to miss out by a point on the last day of the 1998/99 season			1
bounce back : @entity48 won the treble in 1999 after losing 3 - 0 to @entity4 in the @entity8 stick a treble on @entity9 but @entity4 's 3 - 0 in victory from 1998 would only inspire @entity48 to go on and win the treble the following season			1
wenger out ? the last two managers to win the shield in @entity58 ( @entity48 ) and @entity59 ( @entity9 ) were sacked before the end of the domestic campaign			0
all downhill : @entity58 ( left ) and @entity59 were dismissed at @entity48 and @entity9 respectively less than a year after winning the @entity8 the @entity12 trumps the league @entity4 are the first @entity12 winners to beat the @entity14 champions since @entity64 overcame @entity48 4 - 1 on penalties following a 2 - 2 draw in 2009			1
both would challenge for the league title the following season			0
a third double for @entity44 at @entity4 ? the @entity71 went on to win the double after defeating @entity48 at @entity34			0
up for the cups : the last @entity12 winning side to win the @entity8 in @entity64 went on to win the double winning the @entity8 was a high point ... the last three winners of the @entity8 have failed to win a trophy in the following season			0
@entity77 beckons for the @entity14 the last two occasions @entity4 have featured in the @entity8 , a @entity14 side has gone on to reach the @entity81 final			2
heads up : @entity82 ( top ) gives @entity4 the lead in the 2006 @entity81 final against @entity86 less than a year after the @entity5 ' previous @entity8 appearance lucky losers the last time @entity9 lost the showpiece event , they went on to claim the league title at the expense of the team that beat them in the @entity8 , @entity48			2
dominance ... for the losers ! the last league champions that failed to score and lose the @entity8 were @entity48 in 2000 - who then went on to win the @entity14 by 10 points			1
fooled you all : as reigning champions , @entity48 won the @entity14 by 10 points in 2001 despite losing the @entity8 without scoring a goal			0

@entity4 defeated @entity9 3 - 0 in the @entity8 at @entity34
gunners *confident* of adding to success over new season following win
@entity9 missing *key* men but found *wanting* as @entity14 champions
