geared up : @entity0 wears a jacket , £ 200 , and top , £ 75 , both @entity3 for @entity4 at my - wardrobe.com one of the first things i noticed when i moved to @entity7 was how many people walked around town in their gym kit at any given time of day			1
before i arrived in @entity12 , i had assumed that the city ’s numerous bars , restaurants and art galleries would be populated entirely by couture - wearing @entity17			1
yes , @entity12 women are arguably the most groomed in the world when they need to be			1
but none seems to be deterred from turning up for casual post-work coffees in sportswear if they are heading to an exercise class afterwards			0
many @entity26 women still suffer flashbacks to our school days when we had to suffer @entity31 lessons in navy blue nylon knickers , and thus spent our adult lives working out in old kit until it disintegrates			0
in contrast , @entity36 are prepared to invest a lot more in their gear			2
cult yoga label @entity40 is up there with @entity42 on most women ’s fashion wish - lists			2
and just the other day , i read on @entity45 that @entity46 , who is probably best known for show - stopping @entity48 frocks and high - society wedding gowns , is getting in on the act with a fitnesswear line			2
realising my ageing grey tracksuit bottoms would no longer pass muster , i decided to invest in some new fitness togs			0
and i discovered there is even an item of clothing here called the ‘ to - and - from ’ – as in you wear it to and from your workout session			1
it is a lightweight , zip - up jacket designed to be worn over your workout clothes , and it doubles up as a cosy running top for when temperatures plummet			1
i bought a black quilted , hooded version – and have been wearing it non-stop ever since			0
at a recent breakfast meeting with some of the @entity40 staff , they were all dressed head - to - toe in the brand ’s comfortable and colourful creations – just for the office			2
but the truth is these clothes are smart enough to wear wherever and whenever you want			0
the same goes for lots of @entity12 ’ other favourite fitness kit			1
yoga bunny : @entity84 sports outfits perfect for a yoga session after office hours , wearing a jacket , £ 90 , @entity88 , tunic dress , £ 63 , @entity90 , left , and right , dress , £ 150 , and bag , £ 85 , @entity3 for @entity4 at my - wardrobe.com casual : @entity84 would would be just as likely to wear her ' to - and - from ' jacket , £ 90 , @entity88 , for a run on a cold day as a skirt and biker boots for a leisurely brunch when i wore my fluorescent orange @entity100 to a show during @entity102 last month , i could hardly keep count of the compliments i received			1
perhaps that ’s not altogether surprising really , when sporty looks have been all over the catwalks this year , from @entity109 ’s hip wedge trainers to @entity111 ’s famous sweater dresses			0
and then there are the designers collaborating with various sports brands , from @entity115 at @entity116 to @entity117 and @entity3 at @entity4 , to create some of the coolest pieces around			0
so now when i look around , i ’m wondering if i got it all wrong			0
@entity12 might all dress as if they ’re en route to a sweaty session in the gym , but the chances are they ’re making a fashion statement with their fitness outfits too .			1
