by @entity0 an independent @entity2 could be an economic disaster , triggering financial instability and significant spending cuts , @entity1 warned yesterday			0

and he predicted @entity15 , which has been based north of the border since 1727 , would move to @entity18			1
way out ? @entity15 could be force to abandon its @entity21 hq to move to @entity18 in the event of independence , @entity1 claimed it is just the latest high - level intervention amid growing fears of the impact of a ‘ yes ’ vote in the referendum on @entity2 independence on september 18			1
@entity32 , chief executive of @entity33 , this week became the first business leader to say @entity35 is better off in its current form , saying : ‘ my personal view is @entity35 is great and it ought to stay together			0
’ business secretary @entity1 also raised doubts about @entity2 joining the @entity39 , and warned it could mean @entity41 being added to food and children 's clothes and last week , @entity46 governor @entity45 warned that @entity2 could never be fully independent if it keeps the pound			1
during an hour - long grilling by mps on the @entity50 , mr @entity1 revealed his concerns about the consequences of an independent @entity2 on the everyday lives of @entity2 and the day - to - running of local businesses , suggesting : on @entity15 ’s likelihood of staying in @entity2 , he said : ‘ if you were managing @entity15 , you could almost certainly want to be in a domicile where your bank is protected against the risk of collapse			2
‘ i think they already have a substantial amount of their management in @entity18			0
i would have thought that inevitably they would become a @entity18 bank			0
’ he also raised his doubts about the ‘ depleting resources ’ from the @entity70 oil reserves , and the impact that this would have on @entity2 ’s finances			2
there are fears billions of pounds in trade between @entity2 's financial services sector and the rest of the @entity79 will be threatened by independence mr @entity1 said : ‘ it is very difficult to see how this could n’t avoid quite severe cuts in public spending			1

he said : ‘ the pound is as much @entity2 ’s as it is the rest of the @entity79 ’s , and the fiscal commission working group , with experts including two @entity99 laureates , have concluded that it ’s in the interests of both @entity2 and the @entity79 to continue to retain sterling in a formal monetary union			1
’ the chancellor @entity103 has already cast doubt on whether a currency sharing arrangement would be possible			0

warns it will be hard to join the @entity39 and food could be hit by vat
@entity2 government dismisses comments from @entity7 as ' ridiculous '
also predicted @entity15 - based north of border since 1727 - will move to @entity18
the ‘ zero rate ’ of @entity41 in the @entity79 on essentials such as children ’s clothes and most food might *disappear* .
@entity2 ’s financial services may be banned from selling @entity127 , the *hugely* *popular* tax - free savings accounts , because they are ‘ a @entity79 *product* ’ .
stamp prices might rise *due* to the huge cost of delivering letters in @entity2 , which has some of the most remote areas in the @entity79 .
post offices , which are *heavily* *subsidised* , would also be under threat because ‘ quite a high *percentage* of the remote post offices that are not *commercially* *viable* ’ are in @entity2 .
a currency union in which @entity2 is independent but keeps the pound would be ‘ *extremely* difficult ’ .
@entity2 would have to *reapply* for *membership* of the @entity39 which ‘ is by no means a given ’ .
