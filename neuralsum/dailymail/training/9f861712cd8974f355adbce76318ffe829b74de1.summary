by @entity0 published : 07:57 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 09:03 est , 12 march 2014 i get asked lots of questions time and time again			1
why ca n’t i have an orgasm ( from her ) ? am i big enough ( from him ) ? small enough ( from her ) ? ... and the list goes on , in a repetitive loop			0
but by far the most asked question of all is ' am i normal ? ' as a relationship expert , @entity0 says that the question she gets asked most about sex is , ' am i normal ? ' it ’s the most commonly asked question in sex therapy and the hardest to answer because ‘ normal ’ is virtually impossible to define			1
we ’re all individual ! people ponder the question because they believe all the sex myths , know they do n’t apply to their own sex lives , do n’t realise they do n’t apply to other people ’s either and think everyone else is having a better time than they are			1
@entity0 says in order to enjoy sex , we need to stop worrying about what everyone else is doing but not only is it unhealthy and inhibiting to aspire to be normal ( not to mention boring – do you really want to be the quintessential mr and mrs @entity32 ? ) , it ’s impossible			1
read all the sex surveys you want but you still wo n’t really know what other people do in bed because what people say and what people do are two totally different things			0
instead , steer toward another goal : developing a healthy , satisfying sex life where nothing is ‘ kinky ’ or wrong provided both of you agree			2
do n’t fall for the ‘ but everyone else does it ’ argument and be pressured into doing things you do n’t want to , but do consider trying things that sound reasonable at least once			0
if you ’re not sure if you ’re being narrow - minded , look up a few good sex books to get an impression of whether what your partner is suggesting is standard sexual practice or listed with more unusual things ( like sexual deviance )			2
that will give you a good idea of whether your attitude to sex is prudish – or prudent			0
otherwise , relax and enjoy and stop worrying about anyone other than yourselves			0

@entity0 says the most common sexual question is ' am i normal ? '
