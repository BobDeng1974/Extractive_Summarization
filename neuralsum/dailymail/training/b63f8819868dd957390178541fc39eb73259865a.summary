and he lashed out at the ‘ curse ’ of colleagues in government who sit glued to iphones and @entity14 during meetings ‘ mumbling ’			1
curse : @entity0 complained that modern technology was ruining meal times and meetings the nation has been divided over mobile phone etiquette after 26 - year - old @entity20 was told she would not be served in a @entity22 ’s branch in @entity23 until she ended her call			1
mr @entity0 said he had a ‘ sneaking sympathy ’ for the checkout worker in @entity27 , south east @entity23			1
he said it drove him ‘ round the bend ’ when people constantly had their ‘ noses glued ’ to smartphones and @entity3			1
the @entity34 leader said he ‘ strongly suspects ’ he has spoken on a mobile while standing in a queue in a shop			2
complaint : the deputy prime minister does not like people who keep checking their phones , as he was pictured doing near his home in may 2010 but he added : ‘ if the customer was not responding , then the check - out woman could n't do her job and she 's perfectly entitled to ask “ well , do you want it or not ? ”			1
‘ i have a sneaking sympathy for her			2
but i understand @entity22 's have to be on the side of their customers			2
’ he went on to reveal the strict mobile rule around the @entity0 dinner table , despite grumbling from his three sons			1
speaking on his @entity57 radio phone - in , he said : ‘ it ’s not actually formally banned but we do n’t ever use them			2
‘ @entity61 and i have quite a … i would n’t say it was rigid it sounds far too @entity64			0
but we kind of really value sitting with all of us , our three boys , together			0
‘ the oldest is already constantly saying “ oh god , i do n’t want to be here ”			0
‘ but no , i actually really do think you know the old saying , families that eat together stay together			0
‘ i think it ’s incredibly important to spend time			0
do n’t have your @entity3 and your mobile phones			0
’ talking point : shopper @entity20 , 26 , received an apology from @entity22 's after being told to hang up the phone before she used the check out at a store in @entity27 , @entity23 @entity81 has previously boasted of being addicted to his @entity3 , including playing games such as @entity83 and @entity84			2
it was not clear if mr @entity0 was referring to the prime minister when he ranted about people not paying attention in meetings			1
‘ i have sat in numerable meetings where people do n’t look each other in the eye , ’ mr @entity0 said			1
‘ they do n’t appear to be paying attention			0
they sort of half dip in and dip out of conversations			0
they spend their whole time with their nose glued to their hand held appliance			2
‘ it drives me round the bend			0
having said that , i ’m sure i , from time to time pick up my @entity14			0
‘ but i just think we have this real tendency where people are supposed to talk to each other , they do n’t actually talk to each other , they mumble at each other whilst actually communicating with their own hand held appliances			0
