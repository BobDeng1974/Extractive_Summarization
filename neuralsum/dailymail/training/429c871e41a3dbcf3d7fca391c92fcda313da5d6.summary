by @entity0 many young children would feel lucky to have a full set of grandparents to spoil them on special occasions			1
but eight - week - old @entity5 is much more fortunate			1
not only does she have all four grandparents – she has all eight great grandparents too			1
the three generations above her have a combined age of more than 1,000			1
fourteen to one : ( front ) @entity12 and @entity13 with @entity5 ; ( seated , from left ) @entity14 and @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 ; ( standing , from left ) @entity19 and @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 the amazing longevity is shown by her maternal great grandfather , @entity28 , a former @entity30 sergeant who is said to still play a mean game of squash at 82			1
another great grandparent , @entity20 , has reached the age of 92			1
‘ i do n’t know what their secret is , ’ said @entity5 ’s 38 - year - old father @entity13			1
‘ if i did i would probably try to bottle it up and sell it			0
they still drive and they ’re all still active			0
’ the credit analyst from @entity44 decided to record his extraordinary family tree in a photo showing the four generations in their correct positions			0
‘ it ’s the only time they ’ve all been together , ’ he added			0
‘ it will certainly be one for @entity5 to remember			2
’ the photo might never have happened @entity5 's parents suffered four failed @entity55 attempts the photo might never have happened because he and partner @entity12 , 40 , suffered four failed @entity55 attempts			2
one doctor even told the couple , who have been together since 1996 , that they had more chance of winning the lottery than having a child			0
however , after they had given up hope their luck changed			0

it was a big shock to both of us , ’ said mr @entity13			0
