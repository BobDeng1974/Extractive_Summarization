they 've all hit memorable shots at the climax to the race to @entity4 , but could any of them match - or even better - each other in a unique challenge on the @entity8 ? that was the task for @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 earlier this week when the trio warmed - up for the @entity14 by trying to recreate each other 's famous shots on the 18th hole at the tournament			1
@entity12 's effort - a stunning three wood approach to the green which won the @entity22 's @entity24 award in 2013 - was first up for @entity10 and @entity25			1
@entity10 , who has already sealed victory in this year 's race to @entity4 , came out on top though , with his attempt rolling to within a few feet of the pin			1
next up was @entity25 's ridiculous putt from 2012 , which seemed to take an eternity to trickle down one tier and end up agonisingly close to dropping straight in			0
neither @entity12 or world no 1 @entity10 could read it as well as the @entity59 , who finished second two years ago , with both of their efforts finishing left and beyond the hole			1
@entity25 's incredible long - range putt in 2012 came within an inch of dropping into the hole on the 18th green @entity10 and @entity25 watch @entity12 line up his mega putt but the @entity41 's effort was long and wide of the hole @entity70 repeats his final putt from 2012 before @entity12 and @entity25 have a go at replicating him @entity25 also had another go himself and almost went one better than 2012 when his putt hit the pin but failed to fall			2
last up was @entity10 , whose birdie putt from 10 - feet on the last hole two years ago helped give him victory in the @entity4 showpiece			0
the 25 - year - old proved it was no fluke by holing an identical putt before @entity25 stepped up to produce the same result			0
but @entity12 saved the best until last , gripping his club with just one hand and hooking his left leg around it before putting out in style			0
@entity12 shows off his skills with a one - handed version of @entity10 's 10 - foot putt on the final green the @entity96 @entity95 team - mates share a hug after completing their challenge on the @entity8			2
