he may be one of the driving forces behind super-intelligent computers that could improve everything from space travel to electric cars , but @entity6 has likened artificial intelligence to ‘ summoning the demon ’			1
the @entity11 and @entity10 founder has previously warned that the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons			1
speaking at the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) @entity15 last week , @entity6 described artificial intelligence as our ‘ biggest existential threat ’			1
the @entity11 and @entity10 founder has previously warned that the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons he said : ‘ i think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence			1
if i had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is , it ’s probably that			0
so we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence			1
‘ i ’m increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight , maybe at the national and international level , just to make sure that we do n’t do something very foolish			2
‘ with artificial intelligence we ’re summoning the demon			1
you know those stories where there ’s the guy with the pentagram , and the holy water , and … he ’s sure he can control the demon ? does n’t work out			0
’ in august , he warned that @entity46 could to do more harm than nuclear weapons			1
tweeting a recommendation for a book by @entity51 called @entity52 : paths , dangers , strategies that looks at a robot uprising , he wrote : ‘ we need to be super careful with @entity46			1
potentially more dangerous than nukes			0
’ @entity6 is one of the driving forces behind super-intelligent computers			2
but in august , the @entity11 founder warned that @entity46 could to do more harm than nuclear weapons ( @entity63 pictured ) the book asks questions about how humanity will cope with super-intelligent computers and argues that humans are living in a computer simulation and not the ‘ real ’ world			1
in a later tweet , @entity6 wrote : ‘ hope we 're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence			2
unfortunately , that is increasingly probable			0
’ mr @entity6 has previously claimed that a horrific ‘ terminator - like ’ scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence			1
the 42 - year - old is so worried , he is investing in @entity46 companies , not to make money , but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand			1
in march , mr @entity6 made an investment @entity89 - based @entity46 group @entity87 , along with @entity90 and actor @entity91			1
mr @entity6 took to @entity63 earlier this year ( pictured ) to warn against the development of intelligent machines			1
he seems to have been influenced by a book that argues humans are living in a simulation and not the ‘ real ’ world mr @entity6 has previously claimed that a horrific ‘ terminator - like ’ scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence			1
he is so worried , he is investing in @entity46 companies , not to make money , but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand			2
a still of the terminator is pictured @entity108 has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence			1
the search giant has recently bought several robotics companies , along with @entity114 , a @entity116 firm creating software that tries to help computers think like humans			0
one of its founders warned artificial intelligence is ' number 1 risk for this century , ' and believes it could play a part in human extinction ' eventually , i think human extinction will probably occur , and technology will likely play a part in this , ' @entity128 ’s @entity127 said in a recent interview			1
among all forms of technology that could wipe out the human species , he singled out artificial intelligence , or @entity46 , as the ' number 1 risk for this century			1
' the ethics board , revealed by web site @entity140 , is to ensure the projects are not abused			0
neuroscientist @entity142 , 37 , founded @entity128 two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans			0
@entity87 ’ ultimate aim is to build a ‘ computer that thinks like a person … except it does n’t have to eat or sleep ’ , according to the company 's co-founder @entity151			2
in an interview with @entity154 , @entity6 said : ‘ i think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there			2
’ ‘ there have been movies about this , you know , like @entity107 , ’ @entity6 continued			2
‘ there are some scary outcomes			0
and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good , not bad			0
’ @entity87 is currently attempting to build a program that mimics the brain ’s neocortex			0
the neocortex is the top layer of the cerebral hemispheres in the brain of mammals			0
it is around three millimetres thick and has six layers , each involved with various functions			0
these include sensory perception , spatial reasoning , conscious thought , and language in humans			0
according to the company ’s website : ‘ @entity87 is developing machine learning software based on the computational principles of the human brain			0
‘ our first technology is a visual perception system that interprets the contents of photographs and videos in a manner similar to humans			2
‘ powering this technology is a new computational paradigm we call the @entity199			2
’ in october 2013 , the company announced it had developed an algorithm that ‘ reliably ’ solves modern @entity202 - the world ’s most widely used test of a machine ’s ability to act human			2
@entity208 has warned that artificial intelligence has the potential to be the downfall of mankind			1
' success in creating @entity46 would be the biggest event in human history , ' he said writing in the @entity217			0
' unfortunately , it might also be the last ' captchas are used when filling in forms , for example , to make sure it ’s not being completed by a bot			0
this prevents people programming computers to buy a bulk load of gig tickets , for example			0
as well as @entity87 , mr @entity6 was early investor in @entity46 firm @entity128 , which was earlier this year acquired by @entity108 for £ 400m ( $ 678m )			1
professor @entity208 has also warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment			0
earlier this year , the renowned physicist discusses @entity239 's latest film @entity237 , which delves into a world where computers can surpass the abilities of humans			0
professor @entity208 said dismissing the film as science fiction could be the ‘ worst mistake in history ’ .			0

@entity10 and @entity11 founder has previously warned that technology could potentially be more harmful than nuclear weapons
he made his new claim about artificial intelligence at the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) @entity15
mr @entity6 has called for an international body to monitor machines with @entity46
he 's previously claimed that a horrific ‘ terminator - like ’ scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence
