@entity0 is to build 1075 - feet high twin towers that will trump @entity3 ’s title as home to @entity6 ’s highest building			2
the two skyscrapers in @entity8 will be just 60 feet taller than the @entity9 , which is currently under construction in the @entity13 capital			2
planning permission for the @entity0 project called @entity16 - designed by @entity13 architects @entity18 - was granted by @entity8 officials this week			0
top trump : @entity8 's proposed @entity16 , which would usurp @entity3 's position as home to the tallest building in @entity6 @entity23 : the proposed towers would sit by the @entity25 in the @entity27 district in the heart of @entity8 @entity29 : the buildings will house offices , luxury apartments , a shopping complex and a hotel luxury : this artist 's impression shows how it will offer inhabitants striking views over @entity8 swish : the buildings are designed by @entity13 architect @entity42 imposing : the 93 - storey plaza , due for completion in four years time , will dominate the @entity8 skyline the two buildings - which will house offices , luxury apartments , a shopping complex and a hotel - will dominate the skyline in the western business district of @entity27			1
work began on the @entity9 at @entity53 in february 2009 and it is already @entity6 ’s highest construction project at a cost so far of around 450 million pounds			0
the 87 - storey building is due for completion in may this year , when it will stand at 1,016 feet tall and offer uninterrupted 360 - degree views of @entity3 for 40 miles in every direction			0
but it will only hold the title of @entity6 ’s tallest building until @entity8 ’s 93 - storey @entity16 is completed in an estimated four years time			0
the @entity9 : the @entity16 towers would knock @entity3 's newest skyscraper , by @entity53 station in @entity67 , off the top spot as @entity6 's tallest building - beating it by just 54 feet undisputed : the 2,760tt @entity70 in @entity71 is still more than twice as tall as either @entity16 or @entity9 its @entity13 architect @entity42 also designed @entity6 ’s previous tallest building , the 860 - feet high @entity74 in @entity75 , which will now be dwarfed by the @entity3 and @entity8 skyscrapers			1
but all are still much less than half the height of the world ’s tallest building , the 2,760 - feet high @entity70 tower in @entity71 .			1

still less than half the height of @entity71 's 2,760ft @entity70 skyscraper
