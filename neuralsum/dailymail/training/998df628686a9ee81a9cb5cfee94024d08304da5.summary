the @entity78 cricket commentator , well known to @entity80 audiences for his work on @entity82 , said he had seen nothing to suggest mr @entity3 was contemplating suicide			0
as far as i could see at the @entity87 , there was n’t a problem , ’ said mr @entity27			1
‘ he was a person who had a great sense of humanity and caring			1
‘ there were a lot of other things about him , but we ’ve lost a wonderful friend and supporter			1
’ he described mr @entity3 as ‘ one of the outstanding writers on the game of cricket ’			1
after retiring from cricket in 1991 , mr @entity3 turned his hand to writing and broadcasting , and become one of the most respected and widely read commentators in cricket @entity110 spokesman captain @entity109 confirmed mr @entity3 ’s death was being treated as suicide , but would not give details about the sexual assault allegations			1
in his long playing record , one incident stood out – a spectacular clash with sir @entity64 when he replaced him as @entity7 captain in 1985			1
when @entity119 - educated mr @entity3 backed a club committee decision not to renew the contracts of @entity69 stars @entity67 and @entity70 , their close friend @entity64 was furious and walked out on the side , sparking a long - standing enmity for mr @entity3			0
after retiring from cricket in 1991 , mr @entity3 turned his hand to writing and broadcasting , and become one of the most respected and widely read commentators in cricket			0
he divided his time between homes in @entity132 , @entity52 , and the @entity22 town of @entity134 , where he was helping a group of underprivileged boys through school and university			0
mr @entity3 , who was unmarried , was at the centre of controversy in 2001 when he received a suspended jail sentence for common assault after beating three teenage cricketers across their bare buttocks with a cane			0
the @entity22 boys had been invited to stay at his former home in @entity148 , @entity7 , for coaching in the late 1990s			1
@entity150 , one of mr @entity3 ’s victims , said yesterday he was ‘ shocked ’ to learn of the cricket writer ’s sudden death			1
‘ i have n’t had any contact with him since the trial , ’ mr @entity150 said			1
‘ the problem was not so much that he caned us but wanted to examine the marks			1
that ’s when i decided to get out of his house			0
’ mr @entity3 , one of six children born in @entity164 to teacher parents , was apparently estranged from his family for much of his adult life			2
on his website , he included contributions from his ‘ extended family ’ of underprivileged boys from @entity54 and @entity172 – some of them cricketers – whom he assisted with school fees , coaching or getting jobs			1
@entity3 has jumped to his death in @entity1 , leaving behind the last great mystery of a complex and often tortured life that was full of questions and very few answers			1
the former @entity7 captain committed suicide in @entity54 , one of the two countries where he had homes after leaving @entity189 to embark on a media career mainly in @entity52			1
he had been covering @entity52 ’s @entity87 defeat by @entity54 at @entity43			0
@entity193 police spokesman @entity192 confirmed that ‘ a cricket commentator committed suicide by jumping from the sixth floor of his @entity26 hotel on saturday night			2
’ @entity3 forged a successful career as a writer after his playing days part of the team : @entity3 ( third left on the back row ) played for @entity7 during the 1980s with sir @entity64 and sir @entity67 @entity109 refused to comment on reports police had spoken to @entity3 earlier on saturday but said they ‘ will investigate all the circumstances around his death ’			1
it brings a tragic end to the life of a solitary man whose achievements as a competent if unspectacular batsman were followed by a career on radio and in print where @entity3 , 55 , emerged as one of the game ’s most original and sometimes brilliant thinkers			1
‘ in orthodox spheres @entity3 might be regarded as odd , whereas he is merely obscure and oblique			2
he is an unconventional loner , with an independent outlook on life , an irreverent sense of humour and often a withering tongue ’ his life often appeared a long , lonely and ultimately futile attempt to find fulfilment , with plenty of controversy along the way , notably his suspended jail sentence 10 years ago after he admitted caning three young cricketers he had offered to coach			1
it was that unedifying court case in @entity148 that led many to question @entity3 ’s motives when he helped fund the education of promising young cricketers , often providing accommodation for them at his homes in @entity248 and @entity134			0
yet there was no doubting the warmth of the tributes that @entity3 ’s death inspired on sunday			2
both @entity253 and @entity254 highlighted the good work @entity3 had done for the game and his passion for it , being a particularly articulate critic of the dark forces that brought corruption to the sport			0
i worked briefly with @entity3 12 years ago at the @entity263 and i have to say i found him the rudest , most prickly and unhelpful colleague i have ever experienced			0
this was a man who refused to cover the ‘ dirt in the pocket ’ incident involving @entity269 for the @entity270 , saying it was not a story , and once told his despairing sports editor ‘ i tend not to talk to people ’ when asked to do an interview			2
facts rarely featured in his work			0
but i never got to know him properly and those who did spoke very differently on sunday			0
‘ @entity285 and focused , brilliant and fallible , muscular yet incredibly fragile , @entity3 was too many men rolled into an irreplaceable one , ’ wrote his friend @entity280 in a brilliant tribute on the website @entity283 , to which @entity3 contributed			2
‘ individuals like him often sit on the outside , making choices and then fretting over the consequences			2
‘ in the end it was a wonder he lasted so long , dealing with demons and demonising which shadowed him during his playing days and forever after			2
deep down , i think , he knew he would determine his end			0
’ the fact that the cricket career of a man good enough to captain @entity189 in an unofficial one - day match against @entity302 will be remembered more for the conflict he inspired by backing the move to force @entity67 and @entity70 out of @entity7 says everything about the enigma that @entity3 was			1
the rift that resulted with @entity64 , who pinned the word ‘ @entity309 ’ to @entity3 ’s peg in the @entity7 changing room and left the county after backing his illustrious colleagues , was never mended			1
@entity3 was later to write in his autobiography , the aptly titled sometimes i forgot to laugh , that ‘ the cost was enormous ’			2
it was in @entity3 ’s first book , a diary of a county season called @entity321 , where he revealed himself to be a writer of rare talent and it was as a commentator that he was to distinguish himself far more than in a cricket career that was to bring him in excess of 17,000 first - class runs			1
it was with @entity52 ’s media that he made his name , mainly working for @entity78 and the @entity331 , after he had developed a peculiarly acrimonious relationship with @entity189 and all things @entity334 , often disparagingly referring to his countrymen in a faux @entity52 accent as ‘ those @entity337 ’			2
nationality was something that clearly troubled @entity3 but it was far from the most serious of his troubles , as the circumstances around his demise so tragically demonstrated			0
perhaps the last word should go to his father , an @entity164 schoolteacher , who wrote in his son ’s autobiography : ‘ in orthodox spheres @entity3 might be regarded as odd , whereas he is merely obscure and oblique			0
he is an unconventional loner , with an independent outlook on life , an irreverent sense of humour and often a withering tongue			0
’ better to remember those words than what drove @entity3 to take his own life .			0

‘ can you come down to my room quickly , i ’ve got a problem , ’ he said in phone call minutes before death
former @entity7 captain , 55 , scored more than 17,000 runs during *glittering* career
