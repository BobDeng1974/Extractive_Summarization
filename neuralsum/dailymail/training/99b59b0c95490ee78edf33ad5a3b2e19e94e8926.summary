for @entity0 , the least enjoyable episodes of his club ’s much vaunted journey back up the leagues have taken place on plastic			1
it is a clearly a sentiment shared by his battered and bruised players			2
if saturday ’s 1 - 1 draw at part - time @entity11 was shrugged off by @entity0 as merely a ‘ blip ’ in an otherwise impressive run of results , the news that injuries sustained by @entity17 and @entity18 will keep them out ‘ for weeks ’ came as an undoubted blow to the @entity22 boss			1
@entity0 declined to openly slaughter the artificial @entity24 surface , but @entity22 midfielder @entity25 described it yesterday as ‘ a shambles ’ , while captain @entity28 ’s succinct verdict on saturday evening was that it was ‘ worse than @entity29 ’s ’			1
@entity22 manager @entity0 has lost key players to injuries during matches played on artificial surfaces but the manager made little secret of his disdain for non-grass surfaces as he revealed yesterday how he point blank refuses to let his players even train on the 3g surfaces at @entity41 for fear of fresh injuries			1
it wo n’t have escaped his attention that first - choice keeper @entity47 has not played since damaging his shoulder on the plastic pitch at @entity50 in a 2 - 0 win last month , ironically with goals from the injured @entity17 and @entity18			1
@entity53 has also mustered just five minutes of action since pulling up at @entity55 that friday night			0
and , perhaps with that in mind ahead of his side ’s return to @entity50 in the @entity61 on tuesday , @entity0 last night chose to damn the @entity62 ’ surface with faint praise			1
‘ as artificial surfaces go that i ’m not keen on , their one is the best , ’ quipped the @entity22 manager			2
@entity69 captain @entity28 slammed the playing surface at @entity11 's @entity24 on saturday ‘ i do understand the economics of some of the clubs requiring them but i ’m not a great fan			1
‘ @entity11 , @entity75 and @entity50 all have them but you do n’t get any two pitches the same			1
they are different quality , the fabric is different , so i have to take into account the surface before i pick my team			2
‘ clearly , in our team there are boys who are less comfortable on those surfaces than others			0
two years ago @entity89 got a horrendous injury which was certainly down to the surface at @entity92			0
he was out for the best part of eight weeks and it ’s probably on his mind when he goes on that surface			0
‘ i can understand why people would maybe want to train on the surface they were going to be playing on but i would n’t do that because – rightly or wrongly – i think there ’s a greater scope for injuries			0
midfielder @entity17 suffered an injury against @entity11 on saturday and will be sidelined for a few weeks ‘ i do n’t even use the artificial surface here ( at @entity41 ) for that reason			1
i do n’t like training on them because you run the risk of injury			0
‘ i would be loathe to say that @entity17 and @entity18 ’s injuries were caused by the @entity11 pitch , but @entity17 went over on his ankle and hurt his foot and @entity18 , when he fell , hurt his shoulder			1
but i will reserve comment on that			0
‘ and the bottom line is that the players have got to play on plastic pitches			2
they might not like it but it ’s the same for both teams - and there are no excuses			0
’ forward @entity18 also hurt himself on @entity11 's artificial surface on saturday and is out of the @entity50 match for @entity0 , the loss of @entity17 and @entity18 deprives him of two of his top men as he seeks to close in on a first cup win for the @entity133 side since their @entity61 triumph over @entity135 in 2011			1
‘ of course it ’s a blow for us because they ’ve been two of our in - form players , ’ he nodded			0
‘ and with @entity53 and @entity47 also out , these are big players missing for us , although @entity141 will be back and i would n’t hesitate to pitch @entity142 into the team now that he is back from injury			1
‘ our medical department are reluctant to put times on anything , but i think @entity17 and @entity18 will be out for weeks rather than months			2
i do n’t think they will manage the next league game ( against @entity150 at @entity133 next monday ) but i would be delighted to be proved wrong			0
’ after watching star striker @entity151 draw a blank at @entity11 at the weekend , @entity0 insisted that he has no concerns over the @entity133 favourite ’s lack of a league goal so far since his return to the club goalkeeper @entity159 ( left ) has not played since injuring himself in august on @entity50 's plastic pitch ‘ @entity161 ’s scored five in the cups , ’ he pointed out			1
‘ we ’re all convinced that he will be off and running soon			0
if you watch him in training , he ’s one of the most natural finishers we have ever had			0
it is only a matter of time because he starts scoring regularly			0
’ meanwhile , @entity50 goalkeeper @entity170 believes that his side can avenge their narrow 2 - 0 defeat to @entity22 at @entity55 last month			1
the @entity62 enjoyed the upper hand for the vast majority of the encounter , but a @entity17 strike that took a huge deflection off @entity178 gave @entity0 ’s men the breakthrough @entity50 could not find for themselves			1
a late second from @entity18 six minutes from time killed off any hopes the hosts had of a comeback			2
‘ if we can play the same way we did that night we are definitely capable of winning this time , ’ said the former @entity187 keeper			0
‘ we played great for 70 to 75 minutes and then lost a very unfortunate goal to @entity17 by a huge deflection and that effectively won the game for them			2
‘ after that it opened up a bit because we were chasing the game and had to try to get a goal back			0
‘ but hopefully this time our luck will change and we can turn chances into goals			0
