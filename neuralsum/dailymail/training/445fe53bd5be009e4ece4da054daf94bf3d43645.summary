by @entity0 an artist has fashioned an elaborate wedding gown using nothing but 11 rolls of toilet paper , 100 ft of tape and a hefty quantity of glue			1
@entity9 , an art student based in @entity10 , @entity11 , built her creation for the annual @entity13 , sponsored , naturally , by @entity14			1
' i learned about the contest with only a few weeks to prepare the dress ' , she tells @entity18 , estimating that she probably spent around 20 hours working on it			2
elaborate : artist @entity9 ( pictured in her design ) created this wedding gown using only 11 rolls of @entity14 toilet paper , 100 ft of tape , and some glue ms @entity9 , who says she creates a lot of @entity28 and fantasy inspired pieces as part of her artworks , wanted to incorporate the same magical theme into the dress			1
' based on @entity28 ball gowns i decided on a tiered train , embroidered corset style bodice , and the layers of roses and ruffles ' , she explains			2
' but to make it more contemporary i dropped the sleeves , let the bottom drape down naturally , and opened the front of the dress			0
ruffles : ms @entity9 entered the dress into last year 's annual @entity13 , sponsored by @entity14 , and says it took around 20 hours of work to create intricate : it looks incredibly ornate , but this gold trimming is just tape , and the amount of toilet paper used amounts to less than six dollars worth the resulting gown is certainly a spectacle to behold ; an eruption of frothy frills , built around a sturdy bodice and finished with intricate weavings of gold tape			1
fragile as it may appear , ms @entity9 says that the inside of the dress was reinforced with packaging tape , so it was n't too much at risk of ripping , although it did require ' a lot of wiggling ' to get into it for the photographs			2
her sharp - clawed feline friend , on the other hand , posed obvious risks			0
' i sacrificed a roll of toilet paper to my cat before starting on the dress , and he took another while i was n't looking			1
he was occupied with that for a while ' , she says			0
hazard : this looks like a dress - shredding disaster waiting to happen , but ms @entity9 cunningly supplied her cat with a decoy roll of toilet paper to keep his claws otherwise occupied ( pictured ) detail : ms @entity9 hopes one day to be a professional costume designer in @entity92 , but for now she refers to her unusual work as simply a ' hobby ' the dress did n't win last year 's @entity14 contest but it came 15th out of more than 1,400 entries , and ms @entity9 plans to re-enter this year , with a lot more preparation time to play with			1
currently , she is a student at @entity100 for @entity101 and considers fashion and design as more of a ' hobby ' for now			0
' at the moment , i 'm just enjoying teaching art to young students and inspiring them to create their own unique pieces after seeing what i do ' , she states			0
still , she dreams of one day going to @entity92 to become a costume designer , and making a career out of her nifty skills			0
one she 'd be do very well in , if her unique take on a @entity116 wedding dress is anything to go by .			0
