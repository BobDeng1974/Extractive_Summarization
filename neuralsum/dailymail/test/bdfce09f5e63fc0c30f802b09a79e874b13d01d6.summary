@entity0 may be well on course to sealing their spot at @entity2 but it appears as if manager @entity4 still does not know his best xi. @entity7 's top team of reporters have submitted their starting line - ups for the finals in @entity11 , assuming everyone is fit of course			1
let us know your @entity15 by posting them in the comments section below			0
@entity0 manager @entity4 pictured at the @entity19 during tuesday 's friendly against @entity20 @entity21 @entity22 ; @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 ; @entity27 , @entity28 ; @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 ; @entity32 not perfect by any means but i think it ’s important to keep @entity30 in a more central position , in the no 10 role he is most comfortable in , behind the best striker at this moment in time			1
right now it ’s @entity32 but @entity42 and @entity29 certainly offer good alternatives			0
there ’s pace in that team as well			2
no natural holding player ? i ’m not convinced @entity48 is the way forward			0
get the best players on the pitch			0
@entity0 captain @entity30 ( centre ) looks to get a shot in at the @entity55 goal on tuesday @entity56 @entity22 ; @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 ; @entity27 , @entity28 ; @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 ; @entity42 @entity0 ’s defensive options remain their big problem so this is a team set up to score goals and win games by playing on the front foot			1
@entity63 has n’t done enough yet to displace @entity26 while @entity27 and @entity28 represent a holding duo at the base of the midfield that should provide security bit also the ability to get the team moving forwards when appropriate			2
@entity30 is picked in this team in a central role while @entity42 gets the nod ahead of young pretenders such as @entity32 simply on the back of experience			2
this is the first game of a major tournament after all			0
@entity42 ( left ) charges forward with the ball during last september 's friendly against @entity80 @entity81 @entity22 ; @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity82 , @entity83 ; @entity48 ; @entity27 , @entity28 ; @entity31 , @entity30 , @entity29 no place for @entity42 at present and you might have to re-think if he 's clear of injuries - but for the moment @entity30 has to play up front			1
if @entity0 need a more attacking shape , @entity30 can drop in and @entity42 come on for @entity28 or @entity27 , but i 'd be wary of starting that way , as @entity0 could n't defend properly with two midfielders in @entity93			1
the back four does n't convince but @entity25 and @entity26 struggled at the @entity95 and @entity96 is now out of the reckoning			0
@entity0 's @entity27 in action against @entity20 at the @entity19 on tuesday night @entity99 @entity22 ; @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity82 , @entity26 ; @entity27 , @entity48 , @entity100 ; @entity31 ; @entity30 , @entity29 not far off the team @entity4 picked against @entity102 on friday			1
it 's as good as we get at the moment			2
wish it was stronger at the back , where perhaps @entity108 and @entity109 can apply pressure			0
no place for @entity28 in a three - man midfield			2
need mileage and ball - winning abilities to offset the luxury of @entity48 in as a playmaker			2
@entity30 and @entity29 on the basis they have delivered in international football but much will depend on @entity32 's second season and the fitness of @entity42			0
@entity24 ( left ) tackles @entity102 's @entity123 during last friday 's @entity2 qualifier @entity125 @entity22 ; @entity23 ; @entity24 , @entity82 , @entity83 ; @entity27 , @entity126 ; @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 ; @entity32 the two biggest calls here are @entity129 over @entity26 and @entity130 instead of @entity28			1
for me , the two selected will add more athleticism to the side without the loss of quality			0
there 's certainly goals in this team , as well as pace			1
@entity140 beware ! @entity0 left - back @entity83 ( right ) looks to run past @entity55 @entity142 @entity143 @entity22 ; @entity144 , @entity82 , @entity145 , @entity63 ; @entity48 , @entity27 ; @entity31 , @entity30 , @entity146 ; @entity42 it 's ridiculous that @entity48 is only now getting the international recognition he deserves			1
he should have been a regular in the last two @entity149 and will only be 34 at @entity2			1
with him and @entity30 in the middle and lots of legs and energy around them , @entity0 should be able to play the quick and accurate tempo displayed by @entity156 in the last couple of years			1
personally , i think that 's the way to go rather than try and hit a big centre - forward like @entity32			1
youngsters like @entity162 and @entity63 will really emerge over the next 12 months			0
@entity48 ( right ) controls the ball as @entity164 looks to make a challenge in @entity166 @entity169 @entity168 - @entity167 @entity22 ; @entity23 , @entity108 , @entity24 , @entity26 ; @entity48 , @entity28 ; @entity126 , @entity30 , @entity31 ; @entity32 the big unknown is @entity32 's progress and whether he will do it all again next season			2
it 's perhaps harsh on @entity42 , who has proven his effectiveness over greater time , but how can anyone currently bet against @entity32 ? the big weakness remains at centre - half - neither man truly looks the part at the international level but @entity108 has improved this season			2
at 25 he needs to improve further still			0
if @entity31 's ego can process being on the left , where he has shown himself to be more than capable , then this could be a delightful attack			0
@entity0 's @entity32 ( right ) leaves @entity20 's @entity186 face down on the pitch during the friendly @entity189 @entity22 ; @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 ; @entity27 , @entity48 , @entity190 ; @entity31 , @entity30 , @entity29 @entity29 just gets the nod over @entity32 primarily for his pace and movement which is vital to @entity0 attacking at pace			1
if there is any chance @entity197 can be lured back he walks in at the expense of @entity25			0
@entity48 must start and @entity190 must cut down on giving the ball away in dangerous positions but offers more going forward than @entity201			0
@entity26 gets one last chance to deliver on the international stage , ahead of @entity83			0
@entity29 ( left ) shoots during @entity0 's @entity2 qualifier against @entity102 at @entity205 on friday			1

@entity0 manager @entity4 appears to still not know his best xi
@entity7 's top team of reporters *reveal* their @entity0 @entity2 line - ups
@entity0 are currently top of @entity214 on 15 points
