each year , tourists brave the harsh winds and freezing temperatures to witness the @entity3 in all their glory			0
but for those who are n’t quite as adventurous , @entity5 now lets so - called armchair explorers ‘ visit ’ the @entity3 from their living room			1
the images were taken in the north of @entity10 and show lights created by oxygen molecules colliding approximately 60 miles ( 96km ) above @entity13			2
the images of the @entity3 were taken in the north of @entity10 , and now , for the first time , @entity5 is letting armchair explorers discover the area and see the light show from their living room			1
@entity19 is caused when electrically charged particles from the sun enter the @entity13 ’s atmosphere			1
these geomagnetic storms occur when a solar wind or cloud of magnetic field hits the @entity13 ’s magnetic field selecting an image reveals a panorama of the location , photos of which were taken on top of a frozen lake , and users can take in the view or click the screen to move through the snow			1
there are two types of @entity19 - @entity3 , which means ‘ dawn of the north ’ , and @entity43 ’ , known as ‘ dawn of the south			2

usually the charged particles from the sun are deflected by the @entity13 ’s magnetic field , but some do manage to enter the atmosphere and collide with gas particles			1
auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common			0

as a result , @entity19 is most common around the magnetic poles and is most often seen in areas with little light pollution , such as @entity10 where the @entity84 images were taken , and @entity85			1
over the course of january and february last year , this geomagnetic storm and shock wave from a solar wind was so strong and significant , it travelled further south over the @entity90 and could be seen in areas with little cloud cover			2
auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common			0
shades of red , blue , and violet have also been reported			0
the common , greenish - yellow colour is caused by colliding oxygen molecules approximately 60 miles ( 96km ) above @entity13			0
rare , red auroras are produced by oxygen molecules situated much higher up , at around 200 miles ( 321km )			0
nitrogen produces blue or purplish - red aurora			0
@entity106 , from @entity5 told @entity107 : ‘ the @entity3 is one of nature 's most beautiful and mystical phenomena , only seen by very few in their lifetime			2

’ the images of the @entity3 are the latest locations to be added to @entity5 's @entity84			1
previous collections include the @entity141 at @entity142 in @entity143 , the @entity144 in @entity145 and the historic centre of @entity147			0

images of the @entity3 were taken in @entity10 and added to @entity5 's mapping *service* for the first time
armchair explorers can virtually visit the snow - covered region and stand *beneath* the *impressive* light show
