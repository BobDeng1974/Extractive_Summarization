by @entity0 last updated at 11:46 am on 19th january 2012 elderly people with dementia are at greater risk of suffering a fall if they are given anti-depressants in care homes , say experts			0
it is known that the medication can cause a range of side effects including dizziness and blurred vision , but a move to newer drugs , known as known as selective serotonin uptake inhibitors ( @entity17 ) , was hoped to reduce these symptoms			2
however research has found care home residents taking this type of medication were three times more likely to suffer an injury - causing fall than those not taking @entity17			1
a study has found elderly people with dementia are at greater risk of suffering a fall if they are given anti-depressants in care homes falls are the leading cause of accidental death in the over- 65s and the @entity36 's society is now calling for further research to investigate alternative psychiatric treatments			1
professor @entity39 , director of research at the @entity41 said : ' two thirds of care home residents have dementia so it is worrying that a common antidepressant , @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , is causing increased risk to people with the condition			1
' more research is now needed to understand why this antidepressant is having this effect on people with dementia and if there is an alternative treatment for depression that they could be prescribed			0
' researchers from the @entity57 in @entity58 , recorded the daily drug use and records of falls in 248 nursing home residents over a two - year period			2
the average age of the residents was 82 , and the records suggested that 152 of them had suffered a total of 683 falls resulting in hip fractures , sprains , bruises , swelling and in one case death			0
ssris were shown to treble the risk of having an injury - causing fall and this increased if the patient was simultaneously prescribed sedative drugs , such as sleeping pills			1
the findings , published in the @entity83 , suggest this trend occurs regardless of sex and age			0
lead researcher dr @entity87 said that the findings could help develop more effective fall prevention strategies			0
she warned : ' physicians should be cautious in prescribing @entity17 to older people with dementia , even at low doses			2
' while the study uncovered an association between injury - causing falls and @entity17 use , a direct cause and effect relationship has not been proven			1
it is estimated that 750,000 people in the @entity100 have a form of dementia , more than half have alzheimer 's disease .			0

residents taking @entity17 three times more likely to suffer an injury - causing fall
alternative psychiatric treatments to be investigated
