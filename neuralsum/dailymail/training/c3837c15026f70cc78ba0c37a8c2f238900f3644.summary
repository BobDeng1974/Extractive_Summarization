homesick : @entity0 , 34 , firebombed a town hall in a bid to be deported from @entity3 a homesick @entity5 man who firebombed a town hall in a bid to be deported from @entity3 has been ordered to stay in the country for two more years			1
@entity0 , 34 , was so desperate to return to his beloved homeland that he travelled 250 miles from his @entity11 house to @entity12			1
he then created a @entity14 cocktail , before setting it alight and hurling it through the doors of the city 's 146 - year - old town hall			1
the fire was quickly extinguished by a porter and @entity0 surrendered to police , telling them : ' i just wanted to go back to @entity5			1
' but his hopes of being deported were diminished after he was jailed for 24 months at @entity26 - at a cost to the taxpayer of up to £ 75,000			1
due to @entity5 being in the @entity29 and therefore subject to its laws on ' free movement ' , @entity0 can not be legally kicked out of the @entity3 and can only go to @entity5 at his own expense			1
the arsonist 's sentence means he will have to remain in @entity3 until 2016 unless he is released early for good behaviour			0
the public cost of a prison place in the @entity3 is thought to be £ 37,500 a year			2
sentencing @entity0 , judge @entity38 told him : ' there is an old saying - if you play with fire , you are going to get burnt			1
the reason why it is regarded as serious is because the consequences ca n’t be predicted			0
' your motivation you say , and i have no reason to doubt this , was to get your fare back to @entity5 paid for			1
well , this strategy was never going to work			0
that ’s not what happens			0
we are a member of the @entity29			0
' if you commit criminal offences in this country just as if you had committed criminal offences as you have in the past in @entity5 , you go to prison			2
' the consequences could have been serious			0
there can be no doubt about it that you carefully planned this expedition to @entity12			2
it is inevitable that a prison sentence must follow			0
' attack : @entity0 was so desperate to return to @entity5 that he travelled 250 miles from his @entity11 house to @entity12			1
he then lit a @entity14 cocktail and hurled it at the city 's town hall			1
above , police recover the weapon emergency crews : firefighters are pictured outside the town hall , where the fire was extinguished by a porter earlier , the court heard how @entity0 had concocted his plan to attack @entity12 ’s town hall because he was unemployed , penniless and thought it would be a ‘ ticket back to @entity5 ’			1
he had travelled from @entity11 to the city with the sole intention of damaging the building - eschewing the capital because he liked @entity11 and ‘ did n’t want to do anything there ’			2
on his arrival in @entity12 at around midday on march 31 , @entity88 bought petrol , poured it into an empty @entity93 bottle he had found in a bin and walked towards the town hall			1
the building packed with civil servants and hundreds of conference delegates , the court heard			0
scene : @entity0 threw the bottle - based incendiary weapon through the doors of the old building ( pictured ) in front of bystanders and office workers enjoying their lunch , he then ripped part of his t - shirt to use as a fuse , before lighting the cocktail and hurling it into the empty entrance of the town hall			1
the bottle shattered when it hit the wooden frame of the door and burst into flames			0
a porter quickly extinguished the fire after employees complained of flames and smoke , but not before the blaze had caused £ 250 worth of damage to the wooden doors of the building			2
@entity127 , prosecuting , said @entity0 , who has lived in @entity128 since 2008 , had lost his travel documentation so was not eligible for work in this country , which had left him broke			2
he added : ' in interview he stated that he had come from @entity5 and had been living in @entity11 and that he had lost his documentation and had no means of getting work in this country and that he wanted to return to @entity5			1
' he had sought the help of the @entity5 embassy but was not assisted			2
he decided to travel from @entity11 where he had been living rough to commit this offence in the hope he would be sent back			2
' he had no intention of hurting anybody			0
he said what he did was a ticket back to @entity5			2
' @entity0 , who had 15 previous convictions including one in @entity5 for assaulting a public official , asked through his barrister if any prison sentence could be served in his native country			1
however , his request was declined by @entity149			0
court : @entity0 's hopes of being deported back to @entity5 were diminished after he was jailed for 24 months at @entity26 ( pictured )			1
the ruling is expected to cost the taxpayer up to £ 75,000 @entity154 , defending , acknowledged his client had ‘ failed to acknowledge the particular danger ’ of hurling a lit bottle of petrol at a building full of people , but said it had caused only minor damage			1
' there is a perverse logic in his actions			0
his thinking is perhaps he intended to commit an act of criminal damage but used fire for that , ' he said			0
' for no sooner had it started it was put out by an eagle - eyed security guard			0
it was £ 250 worth of damage - not a considerable amount			0
' he did n’t wish for anybody to be hurt			0
he just wished to be returned to @entity5 as soon as possible			0
' @entity0 was not ordered to pay any compensation for the damage caused .			0

@entity0 , 34 , travelled 250 miles from @entity11 home to @entity12
then created a @entity14 cocktail , before lighting it and hurling it at town hall
when arrested , @entity0 told police : ' i just wanted to go back to @entity5 '
but instead , he was imprisoned for 24 months at @entity26
the court ruling is expected to cost the taxpayer up to a *staggering* £ 75,000
