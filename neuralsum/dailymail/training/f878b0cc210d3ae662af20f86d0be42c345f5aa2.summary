if you thought it was cold where you are at the moment then a visit to the @entity2 village of @entity3 might just change your mind			1
with the average temperature for january standing at @entity11 , it is no wonder the village is the coldest permanently inhabited settlement in the world			1
known as the ' @entity16 ' , the coldest ever temperature recorded in @entity3 was -71.2c			1
it reads ' @entity3 , the @entity16 ' @entity44 problems that come with living in @entity3 include pen ink freezing , glasses freezing to people 's faces and batteries losing power			1
locals are said to leave their cars running all day for fear of not being able to restart them			1
another problem caused by the frozen temperatures is burying dead bodies , which can take up to three days			0
the earth must first have thawed sufficiently in order to dig , so a bonfire is lit for a couple of hours			0
hot coals are then pushed to the side and a hole a couple of inches deep is dug			1
the process is repeated for several days until the hole is deep enough to bury the coffin			0

nothing grows there so people eat reindeer meat and horsemeat			1
a single shop provides the town 's bare necessities and the locals work as reindeer - breeders , hunters and ice - fisherman			2
doctors say the reason the locals do n't suffer from malnutrition is that their animals ' milk contains a lot of micronutrients			2
