by @entity0 published : 06:42 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 07:44 est , 18 october 2013 everyone who has spent time in the company of tired people knows that yawning is infectious , but now scientists have shown for the first time that chimpanzees can catch yawns from humans			1
@entity13 researchers believe a chimpanzee 's susceptibility to catching yawns develops gradually with age , exactly as it does in humans			1
juvenile chimpanzees who are between five and eight years old catch human yawns but younger primates seem to be immune , according to the the study , which suggests that humans and other animals share a general developmental pattern			1
researchers from @entity43 , who carried out the latest study at @entity46 in @entity47 , found yawning , but not nose - wiping was contagious			1
they interacted with 33 orphaned chimpanzees aged between 13 months and 8 years and one researcher repeatedly yawned , gaped ( opened her mouth without yawning ) and wiped her nose with her hand to see how the animals responded			2
the scientists found that while the younger chimpanzees did not respond to yawning , those five years and older yawned continuously			2
as a way of examining the role that empathy with the yawner played for contagion , the study also compared the chimpanzees ’ reactions towards yawns from their human surrogate mother and a stranger			1
researchers from @entity43 found yawning was contagious between humans and chimpanzees			1
@entity73 ( pictured ) repeatedly yawned at 33 orphaned chimps and found that while the younger chimpanzees did not respond to yawning ( pictured ) those five years and older yawned continuously cross-species yawn contagion has previously only been demonstrated in dogs			2
research suggests that man ’s best friend yawns when he yawns , as a way of empathising with its master			2
contrary to prediction , there was no difference in the likelihood of yawning when engaging with an unfamiliar person from someone with whom the chimpanzees had a close relationship , questioning previous research that showed humans and animals tend to be more susceptible to catching yawns from those they are close to			1
the developmental pattern found in the study is consistent with what previous research has found for humans			0
humans also show a developmental increase in susceptibility to yawn contagion , with children seemingly beginning to yawn contagiously around the age of four , at a time when empathy - related behaviours and the ability to accurately identify others ’ emotions begin to manifest clearly			1
the scientists think that their research might reflect a general developmental pattern , shared by humans and other animals			0
given that contagious yawning may be an empathetic response , the results can also be taken to mean that empathy develops slowly over the first years of a chimpanzee ’s life			1
however , the researchers wanted to know why the chimpanzees did not differentiate between their surrogate mother and unfamiliar humans in the study			1

children seemingly beginning to yawn contagiously around the age of four , at a time when empathy - related behaviours and the ability to accurately identify others ' emotions begin to manifest clearly ' we do not have the full explanation yet , as it is a complex phenomenon that is being explored ' , said @entity73 , a researcher in the study			2
she believes there are at least two possible explanations			0
one is that familiarity seems to play out differently in immature and adult individuals as the present study suggests that juvenile chimpanzees generalise their yawn responses to humans , irrespective of familiarity and attachment history			0
in contrast , previous research on adult chimpanzees has shown that contagious yawning is targeted mostly towards familiar individuals			0
this research on adult individuals has , however , been conducted on chimpanzees that have seen other chimpanzees yawn on video			0
the researchers are therefore cautious			0
cross-species yawn contagion has previously only been demonstrated in dogs			0
previous research suggests that man 's best friend yawns when he yawns , as a way of empathising with its master ' future research will have to examine whether there might be multiple reasons for yawning in response to others ’ yawns , and whether these differences apply differently within and between these two species			2
' that is , whether chimpanzees may apply ‘ targeted empathy ’ to interactions with members of their own species – and selectively catch yawns from familiar chimpanzees - while they apply a more generalised form of empathy to interactions with humans ' dr @entity73 said			1
a reason for this may be that chimpanzees typically engage in competitive , even hostile , relationships with unfamiliar members of their own species , but rarely do so with humans , who they mostly experience as cooperative , according to the study			0
she said : ' it is possible that younger chimpanzees switch from a " generalised empathy " to all individuals - irrespective of species - to a more " targeted empathy " as they mature into adults and possibly have stronger reasons to differentiate friends from foes ' , @entity73 concludes			0
cross-species yawn contagion has previously only been demonstrated in dogs .			0

the results suggest that empathy ( which is associated with yawning ) develops slowly over the first years of a chimpanzee ’s life
