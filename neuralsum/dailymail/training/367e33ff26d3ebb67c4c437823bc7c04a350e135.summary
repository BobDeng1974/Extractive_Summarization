@entity18 , right , who was then editor of @entity19 watches on ' it is tragic for the @entity73 like many other people throughout the years who have children diagnosed			0
but the fact that they are so high profile could have made a difference			0
' the father , who is said to have links with the @entity2 family , learned about @entity23 's condition just weeks after he was born , the paper said			1
