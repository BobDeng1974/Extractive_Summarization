seat of the @entity8 , the @entity6 , from 1483 to 1797 , the sprawling estate was surrounded by ornamental @entity10 gardens , resplendent with orangeries , conservatories and terraces			1
but like so many other ' @entity17 ' , this glorious example of our heritage is no more			2
in its place today stands a @entity21 office block - and the grounds have now given way to the @entity25 bypass			2

it was demolished in 1967 and is now home to the @entity25 bypass today , a @entity21 office block sits in the grounds of the once great @entity1 nearly a third of the nation 's magnificent mansions have perished over the decades due to world wars , death duties and changing social landscape			1

the grounds where the estate once stood are now bordered by housing since @entity87 , about 1,000 country houses have been demolished across the country			1
others have been turned into flats or have diversified in other ways , but are a far cry from their heyday			2

the grounds where the estate once stood are now bordered by housing			0

part of the land is now used by a wildlife trust - and also as a camping ground by @entity137 groups the demise of @entity169 , the finest @entity171 house in @entity172 , in 1925 was ' swift and destructive '			1
mr @entity49 wrote that it was ' entirely due to the unsatisfactory character of the 3rd and last @entity175 , a theatrically obsessed chum of @entity177 , who failed to produce a son and sold up '			0
@entity118 in @entity119 had its own cricket ground where @entity125 played alongside @entity182 nobleman @entity181			0
the 4th and 5th @entity103 of @entity122 founded @entity128 , but the family home was gutted by fire when @entity186 troops were staying there during the war			1

the former estate has now been swallowed up by @entity200 mr @entity49 said : ' in the book , i have tried to give a geographical spread of estates for which there were also good photographs			0
' the problems for these estates really started in the 1870s with the agricultural depression			0
many of the estates , especially the smaller ones , were based on farming			0
' until the 1870s , we fed our own population and exported food , but then we became overwhelmed with grain from places like @entity186			0
' grain from abroad was half the price and there was no protection for the farming industry			0
@entity169 , the finest @entity171 mansion in @entity172 , lost after the 3rd @entity175 sold up in 1925 an @entity228 garden party at @entity169			0
the mansion 's demise was described as ' swift and destructive ' ' and then when refrigerated ships were introduced , we could import meat from around the globe			1
' he added : ' farming in @entity237 had been profitable since the 1660s and when the agricultural depression came , it was a great shock			0
' the @entity240 in the late 19th century also wanted to introduce land reforms , to tax land and make compulsory purchases			0
' many people felt it was time to sell up			0
then in the 1890s , death duties were introduced and these got as high as 80 per cent in the 1950s			1
@entity194 , in @entity195 , was the seat of the @entity197 for nearly 400 years until being demolished in 1925 , after being requisitioned during @entity198			1
the former estate has now been swallowed up by @entity200 ' in the 19th century , estates were generally sold to another family but in the 20th century they were broken up			0
they were essentially stripped of their assets			0
' in the first three quarters of the 20th century , these estates were worth more dead than alive			0
' other factors included the wars when taxes were raised to pay for them - and some families died out when sons were killed			1
author @entity49 has logged examples of our once - great houses that have become increasingly of interest due to tv costume dramas such as @entity55 ( left ) and @entity56 ( right ) ' urban sprawl has also been a factor especially between the wars when there was no planning laws			1
' and there are always some individuals from a family who are responsible for the loss of the estate through personal incompetence - through gambling for example			0
' after the war , planning restrictions and the @entity281 meant that many were saved			1
and with farming coming back , people are starting to buy estates again			0
' the book is published by @entity288 and costs Â£ 30 .			0
