@entity0 wants @entity1 to continue their good run of form in monday 's @entity5 tie against @entity6			1
the @entity1 will go into the third - round clash at @entity8 on a high after fighting back to claim draws against @entity10 and @entity11 in the past week , scoring five goals in the process			1
those two matches were preceded by narrow defeats against @entity16 and @entity6 and victory over @entity18 meaning @entity1 have emerged from what appeared to be a daunting run of matches with belief very much intact			1
@entity1 forward @entity0 has called on his team - mates to carry on their good form @entity0 is lifted in the air after scoring his side 's third goal in their 3 - 3 draw with @entity11 on @entity29 @entity30 , pictured applauding @entity1 's travelling fans , will be pleased with his side 's recent form @entity0 , who scored against both @entity10 and @entity11 , has fond memories of the @entity5 having reached the final with @entity36 12 months ago			1
although survival in the top flight is clearly the @entity1 ' priority , @entity0 sees the match as a great chance to post a victory over one of the @entity45 's big boys			1
the midfielder told @entity1 's official website : ' these were a tough run of fixtures and nobody expected us to get anything probably but we 've shown our character again			2
' we can go into our next run of games full of confidence now on the back of the last two results			0
' it 's a great game and hopefully there 'll be a big crowd at @entity8 to get behind us			2
' the @entity5 still has that magic and i was lucky enough to get to the final last year with @entity36 and that was a great occasion			0
' after naming the same side for six straight games , boss @entity30 will make changes			0
@entity30 is hoping to extend @entity69 defender @entity68 's loan deal his hand has been forced after both captain @entity72 and his replacement @entity74 sustained injuries during the first half at @entity77			0
@entity72 's calf problem is not thought to be serious but monday is likely to come too soon while @entity1 were still waiting to hear whether @entity74 's knee injury was as bad as first feared			2
@entity30 , meanwhile , was negotiating with @entity69 over whether on - loan defender @entity68 would be available			0
@entity68 's loan is due to end next weekend but the @entity1 could well seek an extension with their defensive resources stretched and the 21 - year - old having impressed			2
even if @entity68 is permitted to play , @entity30 could still need full - back @entity85 to deputise in the middle of the defence , while midfielder @entity89 would be another option			0
striker @entity91 will hope to be given another run out as he continues to be eased back in following a long - term knee injury			0
the 25 - year - old made his return after nine months out as a late substitute against @entity16 but was left out of the squad against @entity10 and @entity11 .			1
