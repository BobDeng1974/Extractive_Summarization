one or two glasses of wine a day could work as well as drugs at protecting older women from thinning bones			0
regular moderate intake of alcohol after the menopause helps to maintain bone strength , according to an international review team			1
in comparison , they say , abstaining from alcohol leads to a higher risk of developing osteoporosis			1
cheers : one or two glasses of wine a day could work as well as drugs at protecting older women from thinning bones hundreds of thousands of postmenopausal women take drugs called bisphosphonates every day to combat thinning bones			0
but modest drinking may work as well , suggested the review published in the journal @entity28			2
experts from the @entity30 analysed a study by researchers at the @entity33 that showed while women were drinking 19g of alcohol a day – about two small glasses of wine – they had a drop in loss of old bone that improved the balance between old and new bone , maintaining strength			1
when the women were asked to stop drinking , their ' bone turnover ' went up			0
one reviewer said : ' the results suggest an effect of moderate alcohol consumption similar to the effects of bisphosphonates			0
' @entity53 of the @entity54 warned against drinking more to protect bones and said : ' @entity57 amounts of alcohol might be beneficial for bones , but excessive alcohol increases the risk of fractures , as well as increasing the risk of falls			1
' alcohol appears to remedy the imbalance between the dissolving of old bone and poor production of new bone that can lead to osteoporosis in older women			1
interesting results : alcohol appears to remedy the imbalance between the dissolving of old bone and poor production of new bone that can lead to osteoporosis in older women in comparison , abstaining from alcohol leads to a higher risk of developing osteoporosis because bone turnover accelerated again			1
osteoporosis is often termed the ' silent disease ' as there are no symptoms prior to a fracture			0
however , once a person has broken a bone , their risk of breaking another bone - a fragility fracture - increases dramatically			0
around 300,000 fragility fractures occur every year in the @entity92 , and hip fractures lead to 1,150 deaths every month			0
@entity95 last year produced a summary of studies confirming that moderate alcohol consumption is linked with improvements in bone mineral density			1
it concluded that moderate consumption of alcohol - especially of beer and wine - improves bone strength in men and postmenopausal women			1
the latest analysis looked at a study of 40 healthy postmenopausal women aged around 56 carried out by @entity113 researchers at the @entity33			0
this meant alcohol was reducing the loss of old bone which improved the balance between old and new bone , thus maintaining strength			2
when the women were asked to stop drinking , their bone turnover went up			0
follow up : the latest analysis looked at a study of 40 healthy postmenopausal women aged around 56 carried out by @entity113 researchers at the @entity33 but a day after they began drinking again , their bone turnover was once again reduced			0
@entity95 said the study demonstrated changes at a cellular level linked to alcohol which helped explain why drinkers often had better bone strength			1
other recent studies have similarly shown that moderate drinking is associated with improved bone density , although heavy drinking is linked to thinning bones			1
a recent study from @entity140 showed women drinking more than three alcoholic drinks a week had significantly higher bone density than abstainers			2
professor @entity145 and dr @entity146 of the @entity147 at @entity148 , said ' the study is novel and methods appear robust			0
the authors seem to know what they are doing			0
' the moderate alcohol effect on bone is really quite potent			2
this is the ' big issue ' in determining the relation of moderate alcohol intake and bone that needs resolving			1
' it would be interesting to investigate just how long the levels of the bone turnover markers remain suppressed - if for 24 hours , then the regular , modest consumption ( versus the 3 days a week modest consumption ) debate for alcohol has some ' data ' that supports the former - at least for bone			2
