by @entity0 @entity1 : 06:13 est , 24 december 2013 @entity2 : 09:35 est , 24 december 2013 hungry albatross chicks are swallowing an array of plastic objects that slowly kill them , a biologist has warned			1
while trying to catch a nutritious meal of fish eggs , squid or fish , the birds accidentally eat indigestible objects , such as toothbrushes and lighters			1
@entity17 biologist @entity16 has photographed the unusual items found in the carcasses of decayed chicks on @entity21 , the northernmost island of the @entity23 chain , to highlight the environmental problem			1
stomach - churning : a selection of indigestible items that have been swallowed by @entity28 and plucked from the decaying carcasses of their chicks wandering albatross have the record for the bird with the largest wingspan at 3.5 metres			1
distances are hard to measure , but one banded bird was recorded travelling 6000 km in twelve days			0
they spend most of their life on the wing , returning to land only to court a mate and to breed			0
the female @entity28 lays just one egg that can weigh 1.2lb ( 0.5kg ) , in a basic nest on the ground			0
the parents take it in turns to incubate the egg for 2 - 3 months depending on the size of the @entity28 species			0
chicks can take anywhere from 5 to 10 months to fledge , depending on the size of the @entity28 species			0
@entity28 are very long living birds with an average age of between 40 and 50 years old			0
the images show the items albatrosses are swallowing on a daily basis , including toothbrushes , golf balls and plastic action figures			0
they eat the plastic objects , which are typically attached to fish eggs floating in the sea			1
in the past , the eggs were attached to pieces of wood or seaweed , which the albatross would either digest of break into smaller bits			2
they also eat items they think resemble natural prey such as a fish , squid or large crustaceans , which make up their normal diet			1

‘ i went to @entity21 because i 'm a long term investigator of the problems related to plastics in the sea and specifically the problem of ingestion by seabirds , the 59 - year - old said			2
@entity17 biologist @entity112 has photographed the unusual items found in carcasses of decayed chick corpses ( pictured ) to on @entity21 , the northernmost island of the @entity23 chain , to highlight the environmental problem dr van @entity16 explained that sharp and large items ( such as the golf balls pictured ) can make it difficult to regurgitate indigestible materials from the stomach of @entity28 adults birds are 80cm long with a wing - span of two metres and weigh up to 4kg			1
‘ when i was there , i looked for this phenomenon , and had a closer look at the contents of dead animals , ’ he said			0

‘ however , these large and sharp items can make it difficult to regurgitate indigestible materials from the stomach			0
while most chicks regurgitate the indigestible material before fledging - growing feathers to fly - dr van @entity16 explained : ‘ if the plastic inside is too large , it will stay and slowly kill the chick			2
‘ when i found these items i felt it was a disgrace to humanity that we should rapidly end , ’ he added			0
