@entity2 's aggressive incursions into @entity4 airspace could lead to a passenger jet being brought down by accident , the @entity0 warned yesterday			0
@entity7 warned that @entity8 was playing a ‘ provocative and dangerous ’ game by ordering @entity11 bombers to fly over @entity4 waters			1
mr @entity7 said mr @entity8 ’s new aggression could even spark a war with @entity16 forces			1
in a blunt message , he said @entity4 should ‘ prepare for the worst ’ as the @entity11 president flexes his muscles			1
mr @entity7 said the deliberate move had placed crews ‘ under pressure ’ – and risked a serious incident			1
he accused @entity2 of playing a ‘ provocative and dangerous ’ game – and warned there was a danger that a @entity11 military aircraft operating secretly could accidentally crash into an airliner which might not become aware of its presence until it was too late			1
asked whether he was concerned that shots might be fired , he replied : ‘ i ’m more worried about a mid-air collision where they are flying directly on top of the @entity4 border			1
their bears should stay in the woods			0
’ incidents have taken place all over northern @entity52			0
in march this year a @entity53 737 which had just taken off from @entity54 carrying 132 passengers had a near miss with a @entity11 reconnaissance aircraft which did not transmit its position			1
a crash was only avoided because of good visibility and the alertness of the passenger jet crew			0
@entity11 jets have also had a string of near misses with military aircraft in recent months			1
in one case , a @entity11 jet came within 30ft of a @entity70 reconnaissance plane as it intercepted it in international airspace			1
closely watched : @entity22 @entity22 jets were also scrambled in october to track this @entity31 bomber , one of two which flew close to @entity4 without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers			1
followed : these @entity22 images show the moment the aircraft were escorted by @entity80 near @entity4 airspace the @entity83 think - tank , which studied 39 incursions by @entity11 jets over @entity52 this year , found a ‘ highly disturbing ’ pattern was emerging			1
a spokesman said : ‘ even though direct military confrontation has been avoided so far , the mix of more aggressive @entity11 posturing and the readiness of @entity91 forces to show resolve increases the risk of unintended escalation and the danger of losing control over events			1
’ ministers were accused of allowing mission creep in @entity102 last night after it emerged hundreds of @entity4 troops will help local forces take on @entity107 extremists			0
defence secretary @entity7 said troop numbers in the ‘ low hundreds ’ would train @entity102 and @entity111 fighters , accompanied by combat - ready troops on protection duties			2
at the moment , only about 50 @entity4 military trainers and advisers are in @entity102			2
the move represents a major expansion of @entity4 ’s military role in the country , and critics fear it could suck troops into another bloody conflict			2
@entity124 leader @entity123 tweeted : ‘ no mission creep we were promised			0
this lot just ca n’t help themselves			0
’ @entity2 ’s annexation of @entity130 and destabilisation of eastern @entity132 has led to tough new sanctions on @entity134 and a show of strength by @entity16 forces in @entity52			0
more than 1,300 @entity4 troops were deployed to @entity139 last month in @entity140 , the largest @entity16 exercise in the region for six years			0
ministers insist there is ‘ no military solution ’ to the @entity132 crisis			2
but , in an interview yesterday , mr @entity7 suggested this did not necessarily mean war can be avoided			2
asked if a military conflict between @entity2 and @entity16 was now a possibility , the @entity0 replied : ‘ i do n’t trust @entity8 at the moment , and we have to prepare for the worst			1
’ defence sources insisted last night that mr @entity7 did not believe a war between @entity2 and the @entity155 was likely			2
a source said : ‘ he was talking about @entity16 and the point of the exercises we are doing in eastern @entity52 , as well as collective self - defence , all acting as a deterrent			0
’ █ @entity4 apple growers say they face bankruptcy as a result of president @entity8 ’s decision to back separatists in @entity132			0
in response to sanctions against @entity2 imposed by @entity170 , he has banned imports of foods supplied or grown in the @entity173			0
this has led to a glut of apples in @entity52 , causing prices to plunge by more than 50 per cent			0
@entity179 growers say they are now being offered so little for their crops that many are leaving fruit to rot on the trees or selling it at knock - down prices .			0
