by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 wales have been forced to devise a contingency plan for saturday 's opening test against @entity5 as @entity7 battles to overcome a virus			1
the @entity10 wing has been in isolation from his team - mates and head coach @entity14 is preparing to wait until the eleventh hour before making a call over his inclusion for the game at @entity20 's @entity19			1
should @entity21 , 22 , fail to recover then he will join fellow @entity24 @entity23 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 on the @entity29 absentee list			1
doubt : @entity2 winger @entity7 is suffering from a ' mild virus ' and may miss the first test with @entity5 prolific : @entity21 ( left ) is @entity2 ' talisman and has scored 19 tries in 40 international appearances for @entity2 ' he is still struggling , to be honest , ' said @entity14			1
' he felt a bit nauseous on tuesday and he 's unfortunately had a bit of stomach trouble so he has been in his room and had food taken up to him			1
' he 's making some slow progress and we will make a decision on him on friday , or even later			1
we are aware that even if he does take to the field he is probably going to struggle a bit for 80 minutes			1
' i am taking the advice of the medics			1
they say he is improving and we are hopeful he will be a lot better			1
it would be a big loss if he does n't make it but we do n't want to jeopardise his wellbeing and we have got to make sure he is well enough to take the field in terms of giving a good performance , too			2
' if he does n't pull through , it would be someone else 's opportunity			2
' uncapped @entity66 winger @entity65 is favourite to fill the potential void on the left flank			2
the 20 - year - old has lit up the @entity70 and the @entity71 with his dazzling footwork and has the potential to become a long - term favourite among the @entity29 ranks			2
@entity14 said : ' i know there has been a lot made of @entity65 's resemblance to @entity80 in terms of skill and ability			2
he is very talented and we have not seen his full range of skills yet			2
there was a lovely offload in the game against the @entity90 on tuesday , he can kick off both feet and he has a hugely promising future ahead of him			0
' hopefully we will see a lot more of him			0
' headache : @entity2 head coach @entity14 ( pictured ) is already without several other key players daunting : wales travel to face @entity5 having never beaten the @entity5 in their own back yard ' we have been running the other options in training in case @entity103 does n't pull through			1
we will probably go with @entity65 or there is an option with @entity106 and playing @entity107 at full back			0
@entity109 could come on the bench as well			0
' obviously @entity103 covers midfield as well and we need to think of that in terms of who would cover that area			0
' elsewhere @entity14 has stuck with the same backline that started the final @entity118 game against @entity119			0
the midfield combination of @entity121 and @entity122 should be one of the biggest weapons against a @entity5 side that are without their five top - ranked centres			0
' we have a settled backline with a lot of experience , from nine through to 15 , ' said @entity121			0
' we have to utilise that as it means a lot in international rugby and we need to use that factor for us against a team with fresh faces on the wing and in the centre			0
' @entity139 will make his 100th international appearance in the pack and the tighthead prop will be hoping to mark his century with a first @entity29 victory over the @entity5 on @entity146 soil			0
the veteran is joined in the pack by @entity66 flanker @entity148 , who takes over the openside duties in place of @entity27			1
' @entity148 is a different type of seven , ' said @entity14			0
' he has played other roles in the back row but what he does give us is another line - out option			0
' he has been in the set - up on and off for the last couple of seasons and it 's a big opportunity for him to go in there and make the most of this chance			1

@entity21 will be given until the 11th hour to prove his *fitness*
@entity2 also without @entity27 , @entity23 and @entity25
@entity169 is suffering with virus and looks set to miss opening @entity171
