by @entity0 published : 16:33 est , 8 september 2013 updated : 16:49 est , 8 september 2013 an idyllic @entity2 morning and i 'm sitting in a cafe overlooking a harbour full of boats bobbing on the azure water			0
but it 's not the boats i 'm watching , nor the gulls gliding and dipping across the cloudless sky : it 's the young couple on the adjacent table			0
they 're in their 20s , fresh - faced , happy			1
obviously newlyweds , the bands on their left hands are shop - window shiny			1
she taps hers self - consciously against her coffee cup			2
he leans forward to dust a croissant crumb from her lips			2
they 're fun - looking , perhaps a touch naive			1
their optimism shines as brightly as the gold on their fingers			0
wedded bliss : @entity31 with her husband @entity32 on their wedding day in 1988 they have no idea of what lies ahead and perhaps that 's just as well - because if they did , they 'd be looking far less relaxed and a great deal more scared			1
the people i 'm staring at are strangers but they remind me very much of another couple who , 25 years ago , sat there , fingers intertwined , staring soppily into each others eyes			2
the woman was me , aged 25 , and the man was @entity32 , 27 , my new husband			1
together we 'd travelled to @entity55 on honeymoon			1
we were on the threshold of everything : our careers , our lives , and most of all - our relationship			2
we 'd never been back since , but a quarter of a century on , to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary , here we are again			1
we look older , a few pounds heavier and sometimes we 're downright grumpy , but i 'd like to think the sparkle is just about still there in our eyes , if you look hard enough			2
as hard - up honeymooners we rented a @entity70 ; this time around we 've got a huge villa with its own pool			2
it may sound as if we 're better off but in truth we 're not , for four very good reasons			2
we 've brought along our daughters : @entity77 , 21 , @entity78 , 19 , @entity79 , 14 , and 11 - year - old @entity80			2
newlywed : joanna on her honeymoon in @entity55 with her husband and although a big family does n't come cheap , it has been worth any hardship because two - and - a - half decades ago we never would have dreamed we would produce such wonderful , beautiful children			1
i do n't say that to be boastful , but before we had the girls , we had no idea of the true miracle children represent in a marriage , for those couples lucky enough to have them			1
when two people become three , four or even six , everything changes			0
back in 1988 , the last time i was in this harbour , i thought marriage was about me and @entity32			1
today i can see that was simply the starting - point : the whole axis of our relationship altered irrevocably once children came along			1
a baby parachutes into your life , into the heart of your coupledom , and overnight everything changes			0
suddenly someone else is more important than anything else there is or ever has been			0
it 's awesome - as my girls would put it			2
looking at my daughters over dinner one night i could n't help but well up with tears			0
' what 's wrong with @entity120 ? ' one of them would ask from time to time			0
' oh , you know how she is , ' another replied			0
' she 's being all sentimental again			0
' happy holiday : @entity32 pictured while on their honeymoon i caught @entity32 's eye and i knew what he was thinking : how lucky are we ? having four children , i have to admit , was my idea - i come from a large @entity135 family , @entity32 is from a tiny @entity137 one			1
he had one brother , six years older ; his parents were only children , so he had no cousins			1
but i wanted the kind of larger - than - life , eventful family i came from			2
@entity32 took me on trust , and i 'm profoundly grateful			1
i know that if he had married anybody else he would have settled for just a couple of children , but he 's been entirely won round to my big - family ethos			1
i 've earned the right to be sentimental			0
a quarter of a century is a long haul for any couple and there were times i did n't think we 'd make it			1
while we have enjoyed a great many highs together , we 've also endured our share of lows , from ill health to money woes and career disappointments			0
ten years in , @entity32 's devotion to his work , a trait i once so admired , became a source of huge resentment			1
his workaholism meant many nights i was left alone to cope with sick and fractious children			2
my enthusiasm for ' attachment parenting ' - having our babies always with us , even in our bed at night - was tricky for him to negotiate			2
' i caught @entity32 's eye and i knew what he was thinking : how lucky are we ? ' all of this is the fabric of marriage until , finally , you fall into one camp : you become one of the four out of ten who throw in the towel or one of the six who hang on in there			1
i feel proud that we 're the latter - not that there were n't dark days in between			1
the scariest moment in a marriage , i once read , is not the moment you realise you do n't love your partner any more : it 's the moment it hits you that you no longer like them			2
a few years ago i did a series of interviews with couples who 'd been married 60 - plus years			1
they were candid about how they 'd stayed the course			0
one thing i discovered was that , whenever the couples had come up against big problems , simply hanging on and waiting for the storm to pass had led to better times - not just once , but in every single case			2
another thing the interviews taught me was this : what sometimes passes for ' perfection ' in a marriage could very well be - whisper it - a touch boring			1
some of the ' happy ' marriages i heard about were rather uneventful			0
and whatever else has happened in our long years together , one thing i 'm grateful for is that we 've always had plenty to say to one another			2
young love : @entity0 , pictured 25 years ago whilst on her honeymoon , on the threshold of life it might not have been smoochie stuff , but as far as i 'm concerned my husband is the most interesting man i 've ever had dinner with			1
he listens , he 's well - read , he 's fair , and he invariably has a take on an issue that i have n't considered			0
no matter what lies ahead we will never falter for conversation			0
marriages rarely fail over just one issue - and sometimes , it seems to me , the problems lie not in the relationship , but in one partner 's dissatisfaction with his or her own life			0
often , i 've realised the root cause of my fed - upness at any point was n't @entity32 , but something else i could tackle : my job , friends , appearance			1
a marriage is the bedrock of a life - but it 's not the entirety			1
other things conspire to make a person unhappy - and marriage is too easy a thing to blame			1
there 's always fault if you look for it			0
when my father died 48 years after my parents ' got married , my mother wrote this tribute with her flowers on the coffin : ' so many happy memories			0
' that is what it 's about			0
@entity32 and i have memories of babies being born ; of small children playing on the beach ; of older ones , in their too - big , pristine uniforms , setting off for their first day at school			1
' so many happy memories ' : @entity0 and @entity32 feel very lucky to have a family like theirs from this summer we have a new memory : @entity77 , our eldest , graduated from university			1
it was a hot july day , we sat side by side in a big hall with bright lights , and watched as our lovely daughter , in her gown and mortar board , stepped up onto the stage to collect her degree			0
there was no one i 'd rather have been sitting beside than my husband , the only other person in the world who could feel exactly as i did			0
and i 'm certain he 'd say the same			0
i hope that in another 25 years we can return to @entity55 to celebrate our golden wedding anniversary			1
how wonderful if , by then , our brood has grown even more			0
if our daughters desire the big family we craved , we could be paddling in the sea with 16 grandchildren in tow			0
but now , i look again at the couple at the next table			0
i 'm in awe of them ; their chutzpah , their cheek			0
there they are , with laughter in their eyes , believing that whatever life throws at them , they can deal with it together			0
i raise my glass to them , and i hope with all my heart they are one of the couples who make it .			0

as newly wed twenty - somethings , we went to @entity55 for our honeymoon
a quarter of a century later , @entity32 and i returned with our children in tow
our marriage has certainly had its ups and downs
but we 're looking forward to the next twenty - five years
