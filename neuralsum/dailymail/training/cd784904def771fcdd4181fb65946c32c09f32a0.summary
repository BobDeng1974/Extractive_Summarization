the last time @entity1 can remember playing in a such a one - side game was in the tiny square outside his house in @entity5 , southern @entity6			1
it was there that the young @entity1 would score goals and celebrate like @entity10 , trying to replicate his @entity12 hero			1
he wanted to be like @entity10 : a powerful , bustling striker with a bullet header and shot like thunder			1
little did he know that , at the age of 29 , he would realise his dream			2
4 @entity31 joined @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 as the only men with four @entity12 assists in a game			2
nor that it would be at @entity20 , the club where the teenaged @entity10 broke through to become one of the greatest forwards in @entity44 football			1
@entity1 claimed two more strikes in the thrashing of @entity21 — making it six goals in eight @entity12 appearances since he signed in the summer — and ran the opposition ’s back line ragged			1
he said : ‘ when i was young and i scored , it was “ a great @entity23 ” or “ a great @entity10 ”			1
when you are young , you want to be someone who is already in the @entity12 or @entity54 ‘ now i ’m happy that i am here			0
i see a lot of love from kids who want to be me			0
i have to always show them that with work you can reach what you want to reach			0
’ @entity1 was only denied a hat - trick by the combination of a half - save from @entity21 goalkeeper @entity64 and the ineptitude of midfielder @entity66			1
@entity1 wants to keep the match ball as his shot was heading in before @entity66 ( r ) bundled it over the line @entity70 got a miserable day going for @entity21 with a sliced own goal @entity1 and @entity19 picked up the @entity72 ' and @entity73 of the month awards for september video an unbelievable result - @entity19 his strike was powerful and @entity64 could only push it to one side			1
the ball was creeping towards the goal - line until @entity66 got it caught in his feet and bundled it over the line			2
but @entity1 is determined to keep the match - ball for scoring three			1
‘ we are going to ask them to give me the third goal , ’ he explained			0
‘ the club is going to fight for it			0
one goal counts ! for a striker , it always counts			2
’ considering goals were few and far between in the early part of @entity1 ’s career , struggling in @entity54 in his teens and early 20s , it is understandable he is so keen to add as many to his name as he can			1
scoring has come far easier in the past two seasons			0
moving to @entity100 ’s @entity99 , first to @entity101 where he played for @entity102 and then @entity103 under @entity19 , ignited @entity1			1
he won the league but was not prolific at @entity101			0
in two seasons at @entity103 he struck 50 goals in 57 league games before @entity19 took @entity1 with him to @entity20 for £ 8million			1
the @entity109 striker was not prolific at @entity101 before joining @entity110 @entity1 scored on his @entity109 debut against @entity112 in a @entity114 qualifier last week continuing that form into this season has finally earned him a call - up to the @entity6 side and he netted on his debut , against @entity112 , during the international break			1
a few days later he was named the @entity12 player of the month and celebrated by starring in one of the biggest wins in league history			0
‘ it was the best week of my career , ’ he added			0
‘ i had great moments in the past			0
i was happy in many situations			0
but this is something i am doing in a higher league , the best competition in the world			0
i believe in myself , i believe in the team			0
i just want to keep going , it ’s just the beginning			0
it will be really bad to stop now because it does n’t have meaning			0
if we stop now , at the end of the season nobody will remember			2
’ he is scoring goals which @entity10 would surely have been proud of			1
for instance , against @entity141 when he flicked the ball up and sent it into the top - right corner with an overhead kick			2
but while @entity1 is earning plaudits for finding the net , @entity148 ’s @entity31 — another @entity19 recruit bought from @entity150 — is pulling the strings			1
against @entity21 , not only did @entity31 score , he set up four of the other goals			2
@entity1 said : ‘ when i was in @entity100 , i had a question : which player would you like to play with ? i said : “ @entity157 are a bit selfish			2
he always wants to be dangerous ”			0
’ summer signing @entity31 jumps into the arms of @entity109 forward @entity1 after scoring his side 's sixth goal @entity64 watches on as @entity165 squeezes the ball into the back of @entity21 's net for the third			1

@entity20 thrashed @entity21 8 - 0 at @entity26 's on saturday
@entity1 scored two but claims it should have been three
@entity109 striker says he ca *n't* remember a game like that since he was a child
@entity1 claims he idolised @entity10 and @entity23
