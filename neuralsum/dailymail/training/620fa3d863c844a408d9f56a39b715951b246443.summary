by @entity0 published : 09:21 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 08:27 est , 16 july 2013 the awkward job of transporting a canoe could soon be a thing of the past after an inventor has designed one that can be packed down to the size of a suitcase			0
called a @entity11 , the boat is made of three sections that slot together in less than a minute to create the 7.6ft vessel			1
these sections can then be separated and packed inside each other to make the 19kg boat fully portable so that it fits in the boot of a car with one seat folded down , on the backseats or stored in a cupboard at home			1
a keen canoeist and inventor from @entity25 has designed a portable kayak			2
the @entity11 , pictured , is made of three sections that slot together and can be stacked together to fit into the back of a car or stored in a cupboard when packed away , the @entity11 can fit comfortably into a car boot , pictured left , as well as sit across the backseat , right			1
the boat only weighs 19kg which means it can be carried and assembled by a single person in around 60 seconds without the need for any specialist tools last year two design students from @entity39 created a foldable boat based on the ones created using origami			1
the full - size vessel is folded from a 8ft by 5ft piece of plastic and can be transformed from a flat sheet to a rowing boat by a single person in two minutes using only three components			1
another model of the £ 800 ' @entity51 ' can be folded up and carried in a backpack the single sheet of plastic can be folded over and over again up to 6,000 times and comes in two designs - one that folds into an easy - to - carry parcel and one that unfolds completely flat			2
the @entity11 is the brain child of keen canoeist and inventor @entity60 from @entity61 , @entity25			1
@entity60 designed the vessel as a solution to motorists stacking canoes and kayaks onto the roof of their cars			2
he wanted to design a canoe that could be packed into the boot of a car to negate the need for a roof rack			0
this in turn boosts fuel efficiency because there is less drag created as the car drives on a motorway			0
the @entity11 is made up of three slottable compartments - the tip of the bow connects to a section containing the seat and the midship , which then slots into the stern			1
these sections have been designed in such a way so that they fit inside one another			2
@entity60 claims it only takes 60 seconds to assemble the @entity11 and less time to fold it down			1
and because the sections slot together , this can be done single - handedly without any tools			2
when the three sections are fitted together the full length of the @entity11 is 7.6ft long and 2.25ft wide			1
this series of images shows how the three slottable sections of the @entity11 fit together to form the 19kg portable boat , pictured top			1
these sections can then be unpacked and fitted together to form the 7.6ft vessel , pictured bottom , with the seat added when it is packed away , the boat can be carried by one person and weighs 19kg			1
the 46 - year - old inventor started on the design in september last year following his trip to the coast and completed his first canoe in may			0
he has now built two fibreglass @entity114 , which are on sale with @entity117 in @entity118 , and has a patent pending			0
@entity60 is then hoping to liaise with a canoe manufacturer and he has two more variants designed in a longer , more traditional canoe shape with splashdecks fitted , which he hopes to make in the future			0
the @entity11 is the brain child of 46 - year - old @entity60 , pictured in his invention , from @entity61 , @entity25			2
@entity60 wanted to design a portable alternative to roof - mounted canoes @entity129 's @entity11 costs £ 465			1
only two models are currently available in @entity131 but the inventor plans to sell them across the country soon he said : ' i was in @entity136 last year and saw lots of canoes being transported on the roofs of cars , and thought there must be a better way of doing that			0
' i started designing a take - apart sectional canoe , that stacks inside itself , taking up no more room than a large suitcase to make transport easier			0
' it fits in the car , so the car has maximum fuel economy on motorways			0
' it 's also much safer as it ca n't fall off the roof and it is easy to park in car parks as there is nothing overhanging			0
' it is easy to store when at home - you can place it under the stairs , in the garage or shed , in the loft			0
' ' after two designs were not what i wanted , i found a way of making the sections slot together with no bolts , straps or tools			0
' i have taken it out on the river extensively and it paddles very well and turns in a tight circle			0
it is a fun hybrid between a kayak and a canoe and you can you can just pack it up , put into in your boot and away you go			0
' the @entity11 costs £ 465 .			1

the fibreglass boat is called a @entity11 and costs £ 465
its 3 sections can be taken apart to make it portable
the vessel is 7.6ft long when fully opened and weighs 19kg
