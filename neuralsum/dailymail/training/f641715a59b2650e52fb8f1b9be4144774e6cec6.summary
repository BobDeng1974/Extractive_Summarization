i ’m pleased that he ’s doing something positive '			1
mr @entity8 says he now is looking for a woman of any age with ' a good sense of humour ' to join him on the two - week break at an all - inclusive four star resort in the @entity29			1
he leaves for the @entity13 on february 16 and returns on march 3 and hopes he 'll have a ' new friend ' with him			2
but he has warned any new companion they would be sharing a room and said : ' i 've got no criminal record but should be locked up for my snoring '			0
explaining his decision to sell - off part of his honeymoon to the highest bidder he said : ' i was gutted when she said she did n't want to get married but i realised i could n't mope forever and i did n't want what i 'd already paid to the holiday to go to waste			1
' besides , i think it will be good for me to get away			0
i 'm just looking for a new friend who fancies a holiday with someone fun			2
' he claims his girlfriend of two years , @entity36 , told him she had pre-wedding nerves and could not go through with their wedding due to take place on @entity17 this year			1
two days later they were due to head off on their honeymoon			0
his ex-girlfriend @entity36 said : ' i just did n’t feel ready to get married and @entity8 was n’t my soulmate			2
obviously it ’s difficult for @entity8 , i ’m finding it hard too			2
' it ’s obviously not nice to finish with someone over @entity2 but i thought it was better that he knew now , sooner rather than later			0
' it was better that i called it off now than getting to the altar and not being able to go through with it			0
' fair play to @entity8			1
i ’m pleased that he ’s doing something positive			1
' reaction : mr @entity8 said he was sad about his break - up but was n't willing to ' mope ' and wanted to enjoy his holiday positive : his ex @entity36 says she is pleased that mr @entity8 is trying to get on with his life after they split but when he tried to cancel their holiday the co-op said he would only be able to claim half the cost back so he decided to keep the holiday and advertise for a new companion to join him			1
with the help of his best friend @entity98 , he set up an @entity100 auction to find someone to travel with him and the top bid now stands at £ 51			1
@entity8 describes himself as a slim , 5 ' 9 , with dark hair who enjoys a good laugh			2
his advert reads : ' i 'm not boring , i 'm adventurous otherwise i would n't be doing something as ridiculous as this '			2
although the couple had been engaged for a year and due to marry in just five weeks ' time on @entity17 , @entity8 says he harbours no bitterness to his ex-fiancee			1
plea : the jilted boyfriend said there is nothing ' sinister ' about his plan and is looking for a ' new friend ' to join him on his trip of a lifetime he said : ' i 'm just really glad she told me before we went through with the vows on our big day - i suppose i 've got to respect her honesty			2
' but i 'm certainly not going to let the money or the opportunity pass me by			0
' when i found out at the travel agent i could only get half my money back i was looking at other deals and places i could go but i thought , ' no , i wanted to go on this holiday '			0
' i called my best friend and he agreed so i headed straight to his house to make the ebay page			0
' everyone i know is taken and i 'd rather go and enjoy it with someone new that i 'd never otherwise get to meet			0
' i 'm not looking for a relationship - this could be an opportunity for someone who has never had the chance to take a holiday like this before			2
' i 'm not looking for anything apart from a fun holiday			0
if the girl is sporty and wants to do some scuba diving with me that would be great too			0
' i really thought that i would only get about £ 100 on ebay - enough to pay the £ 50 name change fee and a bit of spending money			0
' i ca n't believe how well it was going			0
so if you 're up for a laugh and fancy a fantastic holiday - let me know ! ' prize : the winning bidder , as long as it is a woman , will get to spend two weeks with @entity8 here at the @entity157 in the @entity13 after being overwhelmed with the response , @entity8 has pledged to donate any money over £ 1,050 to testicular cancer research			1
