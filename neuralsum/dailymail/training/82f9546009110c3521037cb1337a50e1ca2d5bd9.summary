cottage owners who watched their 140 - year - old homes pulled down because of a landslide have slammed a council after they were handed a £ 40,000 bill for the cost of the demolition			1
five houses which overlooked the harbour in @entity9 , @entity10 , had to be knocked down in december after flooding washed away the land beneath them			1
nearby @entity14 's church and its cliff - top graveyard , which featured in @entity16 , was also affected by the landslides which caused human bones from the exposed graves to fall down the cliff into neighbour 's gardens			1
in danger : the five houses in @entity9 became unstable after flooding washed away the land beneath them no time : homeowners had just 30 minutes to grab their belongings before workers moved in to begin demolishing the houses gone : the five 140 - year - old cottagers were torn down on @entity33 in @entity9 , north @entity10 insult to injury : residents have suffered further misery after they were asked to pay £ 40,000 by @entity37 for the demolition work the heavy rain caused a gaping hole to emerge at the front of the street and @entity37 ordered the homes had to be demolished immediately			1
@entity44 , 62 , who had lived in her home for 26 years , said she had just 30 minutes to clear her house of possessions before fleeing the property			2
and now she has suffered further misery after the council handed her a £ 40,000 bill to cover the cost of the work			1
the retired training manager , who was the only permanent resident of @entity56 , said : ' i loved that house			2
having to leave it so quickly was horrendous and such an emotional wrench			0
' now i feel as though things have been made even worse than they already were			0
' the decision was made by @entity64 to demolish the houses very quickly , within a matter of hours			0
' they did not feel they had time to test the foundations the houses stood on even though there was not a crack in any of the cottages			0
now they have sent us this bill for £ 40,000			1
' owners of the other properties , which were all holiday homes , have already been told their insurance company will pay out but ms @entity80 is still waiting to find out if her insurer saga will cover the bill			1
at the moment they have said they will accept payment of the value of the house , ' she said			0
' i would guess my property was worth about £ 175,000			2
but if i am liable to pay £ 40,000 then this could leave me in the unfortunate position of being unable to afford a new home			1
' raining bones : nearby @entity14 's church was also affected after human bones began falling down the cliff from graves which were exposed by the landslide eerie : ancient graves were exposed at the church , which dates back to the 1100s , after heavy rain @entity106 , left , starring as @entity16 , the classic novel written by @entity108 , right contractors were called in to help retain the cliffside below @entity14 's , but the church has now been ordered to pay £ 90,000 to stabilise it			1
vicar rev @entity112 said the church is having to pay its own costs out of money earmarked to ensure the future of buildings including the @entity118 i listed @entity14 's			0
he added : ' there is no help from central funding for parishes , we do this work without prejudice , but there are houses and businesses below and we need to get it done			0
' if you live below a cliffside that has been moving since 1700 it is one of the things that can happen			0
' this is money needed for repairs to our four churches			0
' @entity139 said it used emergency powers to demolish homes in @entity33 because of the instability of the site			2
a spokesperson said : ' in that respect as it was taxpayers ' money we are obliged to recoup that cost and we have been negotiating with the home - owners and their insurance companies			1
' some insurers have already accepted liability and have paid out in full on the claim , including the cost of demolition			2
' some insurers have agreed that policy cover is in place including demolition cover and have requested further information			0
' a small number of insurers have yet to confirm that policy cover is in place and we will continue to engage with these companies via the property owners over the coming weeks			2
' the council said it did not need to intervene with the churchyard and had simply acted to inform the church of its responsibilities .			0
