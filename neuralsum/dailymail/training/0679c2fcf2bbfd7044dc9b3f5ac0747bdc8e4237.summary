street artist @entity3 's dog , a @entity0 named @entity1 , is more than just a pet - he 's a lifesaver			1
the @entity6 credits the pooch with turning his life around after he hit rock bottom as a depressed drug addict sleeping rough			2
today , @entity3 , 43 , is completely unrecognisable from the description he gives of his former self - ' a proper homeless rough tramp '			1
and he 's also turned his hand to writing , penning his memoirs which is now to be published as @entity3 and @entity1 : the dog who changed my life			1
he told @entity30 : ' i have to pinch myself sometimes			0
it all happened so quickly : two years ago i was sat on the street with my paper cup and now look at me			2
' his change in fortunes is all thanks to the arrival in his life of @entity1 - who not only became his pet but also his muse and his saviour			1
all change : @entity3 used to wrap @entity1 in a coat to keep him warm during their time living rough together @entity48 : @entity3 credits his @entity49 with saving his life @entity3 explains how he had ended up on the streets following a spell in prison for stealing			1
' it all started when i was 19 , ' he remembers			2
' i was bought up by my grandparents and i was getting into trouble			0
i was rebelling from a young age , the amount of times we had the police through our door was ridiculous			0
' i just kept getting into more and more trouble and eventually i went to jail			0
when i came out of jail , i was homeless			2
i would stay in hostels and bed and breakfasts three nights here and there			0
' it was at one shelter in 2010 that another homeless couple asked @entity3 if he would look after @entity1 , a @entity0 they had found abandoned who was fearful of humans			1
' they already had a dog so they asked me if i would mind taking care of him , and it was completely spur of the moment but i said yes , ' @entity3 recalls			1
it was the best decision he ever made , as taking on @entity1 - and thinking about the needs of someone other than himself - lifted him out of depression and drug addiction			1
he said : ' i was suffering from a wave of drug addiction , i would take heroin to deal with my depression because i just did n't know how else to cope with it			2
i could barely look after myself			0
' that dog is like an angel , he turned my life around			2
i 've had relationships before when i 've said to myself " i will change for this girl " but it never happens			0
but having @entity1 was like having a child and i had to keep a roof over our heads , not for me but for him			2
he really made me pull my jeans up			0
' he added : ' i would sit out on the street in @entity104 and sit @entity1 in front of a paper cup so it looked like he was begging or if it was cold i would wrap him up			1
in demand : since meeting @entity1 , @entity3 has turned his life around and is now a successful artist @entity112 tale : @entity3 has written a book of his experience ' if it had n't been for @entity116 would have either been dead or in jail - i owe everything to that dog			1
' during his time on the streets , @entity3 began sketching the scenes around him as well as @entity1 and it was n't long before his artistic talent was noticed			1
' it all happened really quickly , ' he says			0
' i used to sketch builders from over the road but then once i had @entity1 i would sketch him			2
@entity130 started to get about and i was invited on local radio stations and people used to come and see me			0
' i started selling my drawings and they went down quite well in @entity104			1
an agent heard about me and came to see me and that 's when i had my first exhibition			0
i collaborated with 46 other artists and the exhibition was a sell - out			0
i sold one of my originals for Â£ 2,500 which is more than what @entity144 was getting when he started out			0
' no longer homeless but still based in @entity104 , @entity3 now does a lot of work for charities including @entity149 , the @entity150 and @entity151 as well as staging exhibitions			1
last month , his work was displayed at the @entity154 in @entity104 while he was also involved with the @entity155 's @entity156 we live in @entity158 he hopes his story can inspire others and remind them that there 's always hope , no matter how bleak life seems			1
' i was at a point in my life where i was the least likely person to turn my life around , ' he explains			0
' i would be sat out on the street with my fingers blue to the bone and now look at me			0
if i can do it , anybody can			0
