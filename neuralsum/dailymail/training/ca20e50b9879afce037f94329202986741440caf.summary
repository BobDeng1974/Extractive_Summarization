by @entity0 if his critics had had it all their way over the past couple of years , @entity2 ’s role in life would have been more akin to @entity8 than that of the manager of @entity11			1
each time the blue juggernaut has deviated from its path , the accusation invariably levelled at the man at the wheel is that his alleged aversion to blooding young players is the root of the problem			1
in @entity2 ’s view , there is only one small problem with that well - worn theory , however			1
that it has absolutely no foundation in fact			1
creating a pathway : @entity2 insists youngsters will be given a chance if they are good enough the @entity11 manager makes no apology whatsoever for welcoming 30 - somethings @entity34 and @entity36 back into the fold			1
nor does he blink an eyebrow at running the rule over former @entity41 defender @entity40 in @entity42 over the coming days			1
yet just because @entity2 has turned to tried and tested operators in order to guide @entity11 out of the @entity46 at the first time of asking , it does n’t mean the manager has bolted the door on the @entity51 youth wing			1
far from it , in fact			1
‘ we are not ignoring kids — it ’s a nonsense to suggest otherwise , ’ @entity2 said			1
‘ you ca n’t flood your team with kids and then expect to get through two divisions like we ’ve done			1
it would n’t have happened			1
‘ if we ’d fielded a team of kids in the @entity60 , we would n’t have won the league			1
it ’s an unfair criticism levelled at the league			1
familiar face : @entity40 is having a second trial at the club ‘ there has never been a case in recent @entity70 history where five or six kids have come through the ranks and into the first team			1
‘ other than at @entity75 in the early 1990s , it has n’t happened anywhere			1
‘ but it does n’t change my opinion			2
if the younger lads coming through are good enough — they will play			2
‘ guys like @entity82 and @entity83 have come in and they ’ve stayed in			1
others like @entity85 and @entity86 are there on the fringes			1
we ’ ll continue , absolutely , to give the younger ones a chance			2
’ you do n’t send a boy to do a man ’s job , however , and in @entity36 and @entity34 , @entity2 has reunited the kind of strike force that will be required if the club are to cope with the obvious step up in quality from @entity100			1
@entity34 may be 34 but the desire to bulge nets up and down the land remains as strong as when he burst through as a teenager at @entity105			2
@entity36 , four years @entity34 ’s junior , is almost unrecognisable from the player who — for all his exploits in front of goal — often seemed to be playing within himself in his first spell at @entity111			2
experienced : @entity36 is expected to spearhead @entity11 ' attack ‘ i ’m really delighted with the signings so far , ’ @entity2 added			1
‘ i can understand people being sceptical with players coming back and the ages of the players			2
‘ but at the same time we are not in a position to plan longer term			2
‘ finances are dictating that the job is to get out of the division until the time we can again spend money and bring players in			2
‘ i looked at the situation up front			2
a year ago , @entity34 was scoring at @entity126 for @entity127 and @entity36 was unbelievable at @entity128 last season			2
‘ i was really impressed with their desire to come back , do well and be part of our journey			2
i was the same myself			2
when you are reaching 30 , a fear goes through you that you are nearing the end of your career			2
‘ there is a desire and a determination to look after yourself and play on as long as you can			0
looking on : @entity2 will cast an eye over his squad in thursday night 's friendly with @entity145 ‘ @entity146 is another player i have always liked			1
he ’s had a tough time of things of late through serious injury , but there has been an improvement in him			0
‘ he ’s quick , strong and brave			0
he will continue his development with us			0
’ you would n’t bet against the former @entity156 man being paired with @entity40 at the heart of @entity11 ’ defence by the time hostilities begin			0
@entity2 tried to land the @entity160 a year ago , only for him to move to @entity161 , but leapt at the chance to assess him in person once it became clear the @entity165 club were prepared to cancel his contract			1
yet , even if a deal can be thrashed out , @entity2 hopes that wo n’t be the end of his business in this window			1
‘ i ’m still looking , ’ he said			0
‘ there ’s still a bit of budget to play with			0
i definitely think we ’ve strengthened			0
recommendation : former @entity161 boss @entity177 has spoken highly of @entity40 ‘ but we had to strengthen and we need to continue strengthening			0
i ’ll certainly be looking to do that			0
‘ @entity179 has come up to train with us for a couple of days			0
@entity181 is also training back down the road			0
‘ we wanted to take him last year but he went down to @entity161			0
i ’d imagine finance might have played a part in that , which is fair enough			0
‘ we watched a good few @entity161 games last year and spoke with ( former manager ) @entity177 the other night			0
‘ if we can bring him in then great but there ’s a lot of water to go under the bridge before that			0
‘ in an ideal world , we ’ll hopefully get a defender in			0
but i ’m looking everywhere			0
i ’m looking for another midfield player within my budget			0
’ getting back to it : @entity11 captain @entity198 in training this week @entity2 , who will have to do without @entity200 for ‘ a number of weeks ’ due to the @entity203 ’s knee problem , gets the first look at his new side when they face @entity145 on thursday night			1
it is the first preparatory step for the @entity111 men as they face up to life in what is likely to be the country ’s most competitive league			0
‘ part of me still ca n’t believe @entity105 are in the league as well , ’ @entity2 continued			1
‘ it ’s just added to the whole interest			0
‘ a lot of people will have us down as favourites			0
whereas the past two years , in the minds of many of the supporters and the media , it was a given			0
i do n’t think there ’s the same feeling about this season			0
‘ from our point of view , strange as it may sound , that ’s a good thing			0
