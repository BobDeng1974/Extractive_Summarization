by @entity0 published : 11:15 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 12:17 est , 21 june 2013 @entity1 was in the middle of cooking dinner yesterday when she went to open a bag of potatoes and found an unwanted ingredient inside : a 3 1/2 - foot snake			1
@entity1 had purchased the bag of potatoes six days before at the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 - but had n't opened the bag yet			1
that 's when she came across the snake for the first time			0
' first i saw it 's underbelly , which is white			0
i thought i had a bad potato , ' @entity1 told @entity20			2
' instead i had a snake			0
the only thing that 's in it are the little holes , so i 'm assuming it was in there when i bought it			2
' stowaway snake : @entity1 with the snake she found in a bag of potatoes she bought at @entity9 sealed in : @entity1 had n't opened the bag since she bought the potatoes six days prior , so she believes the snake was in there the whole time corn snake : @entity1 believes that the snake is a corn snake after finding similar pictures of it on the internet			1
the snake is currently living in a reptile case the family had on hand from a former pet after some research on the internet , @entity1 believes that the snake is a corn snake			2
' i 'm hoping it 's a corn snake , because i just stuck my hand in it and grabbed it			0
' @entity1 was able to put the snake in an old reptile enclosure the family had from a previous pet			2
since @entity1 had n't opened the bag at all since she bought the potatoes the previous friday at @entity9 , she assumes the snake must have been in there since she purchased it			1
the only openings in the bag were the tiny holes usually found on potato packaging			1
@entity69 : the enormous 3 1/2 - foot snake had somehow managed to fit in the potato bag packaging surprise snake : the first thing @entity1 did when she found the snake was call @entity9			1
a manager said he could refund her potatoes if she had a valid receipt the first thing that @entity1 did when she discovered the snake was call @entity9			1
' first they told me i should bring it to the lawn and garden department and they 'd take care of it			0
' understandably dissatisfied , @entity1 asked to speak to the manager			0
' he said if i had a receipt , i could get a refund			0
' helpful : the @entity9 in @entity91 first advised @entity1 to bring the snake to the lawn and garden department , where they would take care of it @entity9 told @entity20 that they plan on contacting the distributor of the @entity99 potatoes that @entity1 bought , @entity100 based in @entity101			1
' i think they need to find out where it came from			0
they owe me an apology .			0

@entity1 found a 3 1/2 - foot snake in a bag of potatoes she bought nearly a week before
the bag was completely sealed except for the small holes usually found on potato packaging
@entity9 is now contacting their distributor to solve the snake packaging *mystery*
