with its commanding position in the middle of a loch , this isle could be fit for royalty			0
and its regal demeanour is completed by its name - @entity7 , translated from the @entity8			1
now you could own the charming piece of @entity12 land off the @entity14 coastline within @entity15 for the princely sum of £ 3million after a top @entity18 trader put it on the market			1
it has been owned since 1999 by former @entity22 market trader , @entity23 , who once enjoyed almost mythical status among the @entity18 ’s financial community			1
stunning : @entity7 , translated from the @entity8 , sits around 300m off the @entity14 coastline within @entity15			1
@entity29 view : @entity31 's island off the @entity12 coast is on the market for £ 3million that all came to an end last year , when he closed down the $ 200million business he began after leaving @entity22 and made a stunning confession about his ability to play the market			1
mr @entity23 wrote to investors in his firm @entity39 : ' in this business , you are only as good as your last few trades			1
' mine have not been very good			0
whether i have lost my edge or simply need a break after 23 years , i am not sure			1
i certainly hope it ’s the latter			0
' mr @entity23 ’s financial misfortune may explain his sale of @entity7 , being handled by the @entity51 office of estate agents , @entity50			1
certainly , prospective purchasers would need to be wealthy - with the island carrying a £ 3million price tag			2
yet its description suggests it may also provide a remote hide - out for a wannabe @entity59			2
getaway : the island boasts a totally refurbished four - bedroomed house , a helicopter hangar , boathouse , two slipways and jetty moorings as well as a four - bedroomed principal house , the 238 - acre island comes complete with a giant 500sq metre helicopter hangar , two slipways and a jetty			2
mr @entity23 is a qualified helicopter pilot and would often fly one of his three aircraft from the island to his work in @entity76			1
he made his money as he watched the september 11 terrorist attacks unfold			0
he said : ' the first thing i noticed on tv was that it was a perfectly clear blue sky day			0
' i ’m a helicopter pilot and i ’ve been flying for 14 years			0
i know that when you ’ve got a plane that ’s going down , you do n’t aim for the tallest building to fly into			0
' he immediately bought eurodollars , capitalising on the plunge in consumer confidence and the collapse of many markets world - wide			2
@entity7 has had a number of colourful owners over the years			2
in the 1930 ’s , it was home to sir @entity95 , the retired tutor to the last @entity96 , @entity97			0
sir @entity95 built a @entity100 temple on the island and flew the @entity103 flag in the @entity105 - style gardens			0
it later passed into the hands of a retired @entity109 army officer , lord @entity108 , the @entity110 .			0

@entity7 is about 300m off the @entity14 coastline within @entity15 is on the market after a top @entity18 figure *decided* to sell
former @entity22 trader @entity23 - @entity23 is *reluctant* *seller* after closing down the $ 200million business he started and *admitting* he 's ' lost his edge '
