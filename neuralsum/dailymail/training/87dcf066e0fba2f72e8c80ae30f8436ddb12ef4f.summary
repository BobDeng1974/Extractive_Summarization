by @entity0 appeal : @entity2 , whose badly burnt body was found , behind a @entity5 building in @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 on july 7 , 2010 the 80 - year - old mother of a man burned to death four years ago is pleading for witnesses to help unravel the mystery surrounding her son 's death			1
@entity2 , 53 , a bus driver , was found badly burned beneath a railway arch in @entity7 , @entity8 , in july 2010 , but the circumstances of his death have never been explained			1
the @entity20 initially insisted he took his own life but , after an inquiry revealed a ' catalogue of errors ' in the investigation , his family accused its officers of failing to fulfil their duties because he was black			2
now mr @entity2 's mother , who has asked not to be named , is imploring anyone who knows anything about her son 's death to come forward to help the investigation			1
' when the detectives informed me that the burnt body of a bus driver had been found , the one thing i hoped in my heart was that he was already dead when he was set alight , ' she said			2
' no mother should have to bury their child under such horrifying circumstances			0
' i appeal to anyone out there who may have heard his cry for help or seen anything unusual on the night of 6 - 7 july 2010 to come forward however small the information			0
' i am sure a third party was involved and they must be stopped from doing this again			0
' mr @entity2 worked part - time for @entity51 from their @entity53 depot , and was also a dj , using the stage name @entity56			0
he worked for an internet radio station in @entity58 called @entity59 for a short time before he died			0
the fitness enthusiast , who was killed by burns and inhalation of fumes , was found under a railway arch at @entity66 in @entity67 that can only be reached by climbing over a metal fence			0

' @entity2 's mother is now 80 years of age and one can only imagine the agony she has endured since july 2010 not knowing why her son died			1
' his family have been fiercely critical of the initial bungled inquiry into his death , and have accused @entity100 of racism			0
a report into the way officers handled the investigation found that they missed @entity70 footage which has since been lost , botched dna analysis and failed to secure crucial mobile phone data			1
two witnesses who came forward the day after mr @entity2 's death were not interviewed for more than a year			1
