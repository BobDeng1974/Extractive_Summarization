maybe it just took a while for the message to sink in			0
it ’s been five weeks since @entity4 told @entity5 that the problems in his head were close to cancelling out the game - changing talent in his feet			1
the word he used was ‘ lazy ’ ; the message was that if @entity5 kept trundling around the pitch collecting thoughtless yellow cards then @entity13 would soon lose patience with a player who ran out of time at @entity19			1
on sunday , his talent came up with a delayed reaction , the midfielder hitting a brilliant strike from 25 yards with seven minutes remaining			2
the goal came from nowhere — and so did the win — for a side that rarely finds rewards on the road			1

@entity4 spoke of a ‘ spot - on ’ game - plan to let @entity31 hog possession before a late onslaught			1
@entity62 ’s view was more in keeping with most others here , that his side enjoyed ‘ total domination ’ and should have won			1
how costly this sucker punch could be to @entity31 ’s bid to storm the top four			1
this was not a game they should have lost , nor a fixture they had cause to fear			0
@entity13 ’s pre-match tally of @entity34 away wins was two			1
there ought to be perspective , though			0
@entity31 had so many injuries they could not fully stock their bench			1
and their defence , the tightest in the top flight , was only breached by a sublime goal			2
but the concern , quite aside from @entity120 ’s straight red card for a horrible late foul on @entity122 , should be how possession was not turned into goals			1
these are opportunities @entity62 knows can not be missed			2
@entity31 defender @entity120 catches @entity13 substitute @entity122 with a high challenge late in the game @entity48 argues with @entity13 manager @entity4 after being shown a straight red card by referee @entity83 summer signing @entity73 is carried from the field on a stretcher with defender @entity74 replaceing him in added time @entity31 defender @entity45 ( left ) competes for the ball with @entity13 winger @entity71 during the opening period @entity13 youngster @entity135 ( right ) clears the ball under pressure from @entity31 midfielder @entity138 ‘ it is difficult to keep our position in the table and we know that , ’ he said			1
‘ we have to be very good in each game and if our players are not at their best it is more difficult			0
‘ we can expect teams like @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity19 to win games as they are big teams with good players			2
the position , even after this defeat , is not normal for @entity31 — but we keep going			2
i ’m frustrated because i do n’t think we deserved to lose			0
we played very well in the first 45 and had total domination			0
in the second half we had less control but the lucky team won			0
’ on @entity48 ’s foul , which led to @entity122 leaving the pitch on a stretcher , @entity62 did not share the common view that such a high tackle merited a red card			1
he said : ‘ in my opinion it is not a red card			1
in my opinion these fouls are yellow			0
’ @entity122 will be ‘ fine ’ , according to @entity4 , who added : ‘ i thought it was a bad tackle			2
i ’m not sure it was a red card			1
it is the momentum that made it look bad			0
’ for @entity177 , this was a happy homecoming to a club that employed him for eight years before his time at @entity13			2
he is currently experiencing his first adverse moments in the dugout , having seen @entity184 sold to @entity185 and his side winless in the league since @entity188 coming into this game			0
for long spells here , this looked like another miserable away day			0
@entity138 shot straight at @entity63 after seven minutes and @entity52 miscued a volley later in the half			2
by the time @entity5 pounced , @entity31 had taken more than 65 per cent of the possession			1

but we went back to basics			0
we executed a game - plan			0
‘ i knew we were against a very good side in the @entity230 spots			0
the plan was to concede possession , frustrate them and then when the crowd gets frustrated they would look for a goal			0
we wanted to use the ball in those moments and what a great strike			0
tactically we got it spot on			0
’ @entity62 might view it as more of a missed opportunity			2
