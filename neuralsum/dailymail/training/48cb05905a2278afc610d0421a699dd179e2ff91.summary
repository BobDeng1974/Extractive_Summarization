the @entity1 government is to sell scores of historic properties to help it tackle its huge budget deficit			1
a haunted fortress , a cardinal ’s palace and an island in the @entity10 lagoon are among 50 sites for sale			1
the move recalls 2012 , when @entity14 was forced to sell off some its beautiful islands to foreign buyers , to chip away at its enormous debts			2
the @entity1 government hope that the nation ’s treasures will be bought by private businesses and converted into hotels , restaurants and museums , bringing much needed employment and international investment			2
minister for the economy @entity29 aims to make £ 425million from the sell - off			1
it was approved as part of an emergency decree aimed at keeping @entity1 ’s 2013 budget deficit within 3 per cent to avoid corrective action by @entity36			1
meanwhile , prime minister @entity37 is planning a further £ 1billion of austerity measures			1
@entity1 property expert @entity39 said the scheme made ‘ logical business sense ’			2
the idea was first mooted last year by @entity43 , the technocrat who took over as prime minister in december 2011 , when @entity44 took public debt to unsustainable levels			1
the ‘ @entity48 ’ plan originally listed 350 properties but officials now deem that some assets , such as military airbases , are poorly suited for the commercial market			2
the properties are to be marketed through a state - run fund who will advance the money to the @entity59 , selling off the assets as buyers are found , the @entity1 newspaper @entity54 reported			0
the properties include @entity62 , which sits above its own feudal village near @entity64 , about 60miles from @entity65			0
the medieval fort was built for pope @entity67 in the 1270s and has a @entity70 15 million price tag			0
said to be haunted , it was used as a prison from the mid- 19th century to 1989 and has since been an art gallery			0
in @entity10 the properties on offer include the @entity76 in @entity77 , north - east of @entity79 island was inhabited by monks and friars from the 11th century before it became a military base in the 1800s			1
since it was abandoned in 1961 , it has fallen into ruin but could appeal to international investors as a luxury resort			0
other national treasures to go under the hammer include the 18th century palace , @entity92			1
the frescoed villa , set in parkland near @entity95 , close to @entity96 , was built in the 18th century by @entity97 , the inquisitor of @entity99			0
property expert @entity39 head of @entity101 said the scheme made ‘ logical business sense ’			0
tackling deficit : prime minister @entity37 will follow the sale with £ 1billion of austerity measures next year he said : ‘ the reality is that any government in @entity108 is looking to raise funds where they can			1
the cost of running these properties can be huge and the sheer upkeep of them can be unmanageable			0
‘ if properties can be bought by private investors , restored to their former glory it ’s good for everyone			0
it benefits local communities and puts some money in the state coffers			0
’ head of the @entity1 employers federation @entity124 , @entity125 , said to cut the deficit @entity1 ’s needed ‘ drastic action ’			1
‘ continuing with the status quo our country will remain , at zero or low growth			0
’ it is not the first time @entity1 has sold off assets			0
last year a succession of lighthouses on the island of @entity138 were sold off to private businesses and converted into hotels , galleries , and museums			1
the island ’s autonomous government could no longer afford the cost of maintaining and restoring them			2
@entity14 's sale last year of 70,000 lots included beaches , ski resorts and islands .			2

a fortress , a palace and an island will be *auctioned* to tackle the deficit
economy minister @entity29 hopes to make £ 425million
the sale will be followed by a further £ 1billion of austerity measures
