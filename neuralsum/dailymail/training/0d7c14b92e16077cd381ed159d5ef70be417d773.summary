so for the first time , @entity0 failed to score on his debut for a new club , and was spared that modern dilemma of whether or not to celebrate scoring against an old one			1
he had hoped to notch @entity6 goal no 124 just over a year after his last , against @entity7 last january , but will continue his quest against @entity9 at the @entity10 on january 31			0
that might be an easier task than breaching an improving @entity14 back line while starved of service , which was his task at @entity17			1
after debut goals for @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity14 , @entity22 and @entity23 , a sixth was never on the cards			1
@entity0 returned to @entity17 after completing his move from @entity23 to @entity26 the former @entity14 striker makes his way out the tunnel ahead of @entity26 's clash with his old club @entity0 shakes hands with former team - mate @entity33 ( both centre ) as the teams line up before the game the former @entity38 forward did not manage a shot at goal , even though he could claim to have made @entity26 's goal , being fouled for the free kick from which @entity43 equalised			1
but he had no chances worthy of the name to improve on a not - particularly - impressive recent record of three goals in 34 @entity6 games			0
that said , he had prospered against less fearsome opposition over the same period , scoring twice for @entity38 against @entity52 , seven times in the @entity54 against such mighty opponents as @entity56 and @entity57 , and twice against a weakened @entity59 side in the @entity60			0
then there were 11 goals in 16 appearances for @entity23 against @entity65 teams			1
the trouble is that @entity9 and the other @entity6 teams that he will face over the remainder of the season are better than almost all of the above			0
what is in his favour is that he will be match - fit and have a better understanding with his new team - mates			0
' i think he started bright , he was sharp , ' @entity26 manager @entity78 said			1
' i 'm sure when he gets that opportunity he will put the ball in the back of the net			0
' the 32 - year - old forward has a moment with his old @entity14 strike partner @entity86 @entity0 jumped straight into the @entity26 starting line up after his transfer from the @entity89 although he was in familiar surroundings , starting a game at @entity17 was something of a novelty for @entity0			1
eleven of his 14 @entity6 appearances for @entity14 last season were from the bench			2
he was cheered by both sets of supporters when his name was read out in the @entity26 team			2
but in a sense it was as if he had never been away			0
his photograph still hangs in the press lounge , and he was part of a video montage of past @entity14 greats shown on the big screens before the teams came out			2
he started the match playing alongside @entity112 , and his first touch came after three minutes with @entity26 already a goal down to @entity116 's deflected shot â€“ although it was hardly a glorious entrance into the match as he fell unconvincingly over @entity119 's challenge , with referee @entity120 utterly uninterested in appeals for a penalty , to @entity78 's dismay			1
' if the referee gives a penalty , if he saw what everyone else in the ground saw , we would be talking about a great debut [ for @entity0 ] , ' @entity78 said			2
the former @entity14 star tests out his pace against speedy @entity14 right - back @entity131 ( left ) @entity0 is shown no love as he is sent crashing to the floor by his former colleague @entity116 ( left ) instead it was proving hard for @entity0 , who was already short of match fitness , having not played since october , to adapt to new team - mates and a new system			1
he strayed offside because a ball was not played through to him quickly enough , he made a run down the side of the defence in anticipation of a pass from @entity112 that was delivered outside the defender rather than inside , so that @entity0 found himself trying to deliver a cross from a difficult angle rather than a shot on goal from a more favourable position			2
the @entity153 end , aware of the danger he will always pose , roared to alert @entity155 to the danger as he dawdled on the ball with @entity0 picking up speed behind him			2
perhaps it was that fear of what @entity0 might do rather than the need to make a tackle that made @entity119 lunge out at him after the ball had gone on the half hour , conceding a free kick and earning a yellow card			0
further punishment was swift as @entity43 curled the ball over the wall for @entity26 's equaliser			0
it was not the dream debut the @entity26 newcomer had hoped for as he failed to get on the score sheet having contributed to his team levelling the score , @entity0 then did his bit in defence , holding off @entity131 following a corner and this time persuading @entity120 that he had been fouled			1
and two minutes before half - time , we thought the moment had arrived as @entity112 found @entity0 with a short pass inside the @entity14 penalty area			1
but a scrum of defenders instantly surrounded him and he had to pivot back to try to make a yard of space and ran out of room			0
after a period of @entity14 dominance at the beginning of the second half , @entity26 prepared a substitution and we wondered whether @entity0 would be summoned , but instead @entity78 gave him a new partner , replacing @entity112 with @entity195			1
however , it was to no avail and when the board went up a second time and @entity201 moved towards the touchline , time was up for @entity0			0
@entity203 , though , will be the judge of the success of his latest move .			0

@entity0 started for @entity26 against former club @entity14
@entity0 was named in the starting line up after his transfer from @entity23
however the 32 - year - old failed to get on the score sheet at @entity17
