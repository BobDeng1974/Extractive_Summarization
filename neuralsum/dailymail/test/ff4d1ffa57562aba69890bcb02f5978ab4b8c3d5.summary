@entity0 will leave @entity1 with his head held high and a burgeoning reputation firmly intact			1
a dramatic , frenetic 12 rounds here saw the @entity6 sent sprawling in the very first against the dangerous @entity8 , the man who vacated the @entity10 middleweight title @entity0 won so gloriously in @entity11 last december before the result was deemed a draw			1
it was the first time the reigning champion had gone the distance			1
no mean feat considering he fought for a lengthy period with a strained biceps muscle in his left arm			1
@entity8 ( left ) and @entity0 stand with the referee after the judges declared their bout a draw the two fighters embrace following their exciting 12 - round contest in @entity29 on saturday night @entity0 retains his @entity10 belt after @entity8 failed to make the required 160lbs weight on friday @entity8 's unbeaten record remains intact following the tie though he threw fewer punches than @entity0 the two fighters congratulate each other at the end of the 12 rounds , which were judged to be a draw with @entity8 dramatically failing to make the required weight of 160lbs on friday , @entity0 strode out in front of a healthy crowd knowing whatever happens , his belt was n't going anywhere			1
yet this was still one hell of a contest and when the judges correctly called it a tie , no - one was really arguing			1
while it was scored 113 - 112 , 112 - 113 , 113 - 113 , the statistics told a different story @entity0 threw more punches ( 299 - 267 ) and connected with greater frequency ( 113 - 103 )			1
it was a warrior - like display			2
not maybe enough to have destroyed @entity8 's unbeaten record , but impressively solid and energetic			1
@entity0 , however , was hard on himself			1
' it was a tough fight , he dropped me at the start because i was lazy , ' he said			0
' i had the momentum late on			0
i understand with two knockdowns people may have thought he won but i could have done better			0
' @entity66 is the mandatory challenger and looks the likeliest next opponent			0
another meeting with @entity8 , although intriguing with the title on the line , is highly unlikely			1
@entity0 was knocked to the canvas by @entity8 during the very first round of the contest in @entity1 @entity0 admitted he had been ' lazy ' in the early stages of the fight , leading to his knockdown and standing count @entity8 is ordered to the corner after @entity0 falls later in the bout ' if my next fight is @entity8 it should be in @entity83			1
he has an @entity6 surname			0
maybe he has some ancestors there , ' smiled @entity0 , who will now look forward to a few weeks off to recharge the batteries before making his next move			2
only the @entity89 will know how , even though he last fought a year ago , his team somehow allowed their man to miss the weight so spectacularly			2
the 31 - year - old was over by almost a pound - and - a - half			0
trainer @entity94 thought he looked over the limit in the build - up			0
@entity0 would never display such a lack of professionalism			2
the 30 - year - old in the form and shape of his life			0
title fight or not , this was the @entity6 's chance to show he belongs at boxing 's top table			0
a polished display was the order of the evening to ensure his rapier - like trajectory continues this year			0
@entity8 insisted before the clash it would be like a chess match			2
he was right , yet playing with @entity113 or @entity114 do n't often lead to the explosion of power which sent @entity0 spiralling to the canvas at the end of the first round			1
@entity8 's right connects with @entity0 's right shoulder during the @entity123 bout @entity0 and @entity8 exchange punches at close quarters during the tight contest @entity0 is put onto the pack foot as @entity129 lines up a punch with his right @entity8 's right hook rocked the @entity6 who was given a standing count			1
it was just the second time he 'd hit the floor , taking in both his amateur and professional career			0
no wonder @entity0 looked dazed			2
the @entity89 was quickly showing why he 's the proud owner of an unblemished record			0
a razor - sharp combination had @entity0 reeling again but the @entity142 man is a true warrior			1
a far better third saw @entity8 on the backfoot for the first time as , after such a frenetic start , everything began to calm somewhat			1
@entity0 went down again and although it was originally scored as a knockdown it later emerged @entity8 had stepped on his foot			1
if the scorecard had taken that into account , a draw could well have turned into an @entity6 win			0
nevertheless , @entity0 needed some respite			2
the @entity29 crowd unleashed some booing to display their displeasure at both fighters standing their ground			0
yet the @entity6 , who won his last two fights by coming from behind to land the killer blow , would n't have care a jot			0
heading into the sixth , @entity8 was ahead in the eyes of the judges			1
@entity0 , the master of coming from behind to snatch victory , needed something special			2
@entity8 connects with @entity0 's cheek with a crunching right @entity8 again makes contact but over the course of the whole fight , he landed fewer punches the comeback came at the end of the seventh , a crunching right leaving a very open @entity8 tumbling			1
it was the first time he 'd been down in his career			0
@entity0 , though , needed more heading into the tenth			2
the final rounds were dramatic without ever really looking terminal for either fighter			0
and when the last bell rang , @entity0 and the amiable @entity8 hugged and showed a deep admiration towards each other which has been evident all week			1
' the judges see it their way and i respect the decision , ' said the @entity89			0
' there is a first time for everything , i got knocked down and thankfully i got up			0
there is no perfect story , i come from nothing so to have something is a blessing as is going home to a family i love			0
' respect to @entity0 though			2

judges scored the contest 113 - 112 , 112 - 113 , 113 - 113 - a tie

and he did most of it with a strained biceps muscle in his left arm
