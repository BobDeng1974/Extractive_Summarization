by @entity0 published : 17:23 est , 1 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:23 est , 1 february 2014 tragic : horses are being abandoned , starving , when their owners can not afford to feed or care for them			1
this pony was found alone in @entity7 thousands of horses are being left to starve as uncaring owners abandon them on verges and wasteground in what animal charities are warning is set to become a major animal cruelty crisis			1
many have been dumped by middle - class families who bought them cheaply as pets , only to be hit by the soaring cost of feeding and caring for them			1
the @entity21 – which is helping four horses a day – will tomorrow reveal that it has seen a 69 per cent increase in equine rescues across @entity25 , up from 901 in 2012 to 1,526 last year			1
the most horrifying cases include a foal that was tied up in a bag and abandoned on an industrial estate in @entity30 , and a pony , too weak to stand , left by the side of a nearby busy road			1
one group of eight ponies was even released at @entity36			0
an @entity21 spokesman said : ‘ you ’re looking at people who thought they could afford livery or rented fields but have discovered they ca n’t in the economic crisis			1
‘ feed costs keep going up so they turn the horse out to fly - graze			1
we believe there are certainly cases where parents bought ponies which their children have outgrown			1
‘ if the pony has little value , they may not know what to do with it			0
so they just leave it on a piece of open ground			0
’ chief inspector @entity61 , co-ordinator of the charity ’s @entity62 , added : ‘ you can now buy a pony for £ 5			0
people who once could never have afforded one now can – but they soon discover they ca n’t afford to keep them			2
‘ with prices collapsing , there ’s no incentive to send them to auction			0
they ca n’t afford to get these animals gelded so they just dump them on land where they breed			1
‘ fly - grazing has always been a problem in some areas but it ’s increased dramatically across the @entity82			2
this is a major crisis			0
where in the past you might have seen a few horses , now you ’ll see 20 or 30			0
’ thousands of ill or under - nourished horses have been left to roam free because equine charities are unable to trace their owners or provide enough places at sanctuaries			1
saved : a pony left by the side of the road in @entity93 - the second found in just one week only in extreme cases of suffering are the animals put down			1
the @entity21 figures include all rescued horses , not just those set loose and abandoned			1
but the sharp rise reflects studies by other leading equine welfare groups			2
@entity101 said it estimates that 3,500 fly - grazed horses across @entity25 and @entity103 are suffering neglect			2
it sets the total number of places available in the country ’s equine charity rescue centres at just 2,800 – and nearly all have already gone			2
meanwhile , charity @entity110 has warned that the number of neglected or abandoned animals reported to its helpline has risen fivefold , from 160 in 2009 to 806 last year			1
among the worst fly - grazing hotspots are @entity115 in @entity116 , the @entity117 near @entity118 , suburbs around @entity120 and @entity121 , and parts of @entity123			2
and it revealed the problem is set to worsen as tougher laws in @entity103 encourage unscrupulous owners to dump their animals in @entity25			2
chief inspector @entity61 said : ‘ this is fantastic for @entity103 but it is just going to export the problem to @entity25			0
we know that owners and dealers , particularly in the traveller community , already move large groups of horses around the country to find new sites			0
’ the @entity140 , which came into force last week , gives councils the right to seize , impound , rehome or , as a last resort , humanely destroy horses grazing on land without consent			0
this horse in @entity149 was unable to stand due to malnutrition when the @entity21 rescue team found her campaigners say it is vital that @entity155 gives @entity25 local authorities similar powers – cutting through complex legal procedures			1
because most fly - grazed horses can not be traced to an owner , councils can take action only after a minimum two - week investigation			2
although they can then confiscate the animals , the only option is to microchip them – making them ‘ legal ’ – and sell them at auction			0
a spokesman for @entity101 said : ‘ far too often these horses will simply be bought back by the dealer who gets a horse whose value has increased with the microchip			0
and the problem will be perpetuated			0
’ a spokesman for @entity110 said : ‘ unless @entity25 takes action as well , it is possible the 2,000 or more horses being fly - grazed in @entity103 will simply be moved over the border into @entity25			0
’ the charity ’s chief executive , @entity184 , added : ‘ we have seen first - hand the devastating effects of the increase in abandonment of horses , from large groups roaming on to playgrounds , airports , nature reserves , housing estates and farmland , to tiny foals left to fend for themselves , and even one that was deliberately thrown into a river and left to die			1
' it does n’t just affect the horse community			0
it has a severe impact on all areas of society			0

@entity21 has seen 69 *%* increase in equine rescues , up 901 since last year

middle - class families bought cheap but could *n't* afford to feed and care
