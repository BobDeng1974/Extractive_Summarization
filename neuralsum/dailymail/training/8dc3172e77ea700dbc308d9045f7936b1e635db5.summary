he feared he may never see his children 's faces again but , luckily , he was not blinded by the corrosive liquid			0
police said they can find no motive for the attack and are appealing for more witnesses			2
mr @entity7 , a carer from @entity14 , said : ' it was just an unprovoked attack and it has really ruined my life			1
' it has put me out of work and now i have to wear make - up to cover the scars			2
when i was attacked i had no idea what was happening and i was confused more than anything			0
mr @entity7 was hospitalised for a month			2
skin had to be taken from his leg to repair his face , and he was left with scars covering the rest of his body he has now told how he feared he would never see his children 's faces again following the horrific attack ( pictured just after the attack , during his recovery , and as he appears today ) ' i did n't know why this guy was doing it			1
i was just screaming " my eyes , my eyes " and i was in excruciating pain			0
' he added : ' at first i thought it might have been pepper spray but it was much worse than that			0
' it was just a burning feeling			0
i felt like my face was just melting off			2
i ca n't understand why someone would want to do that to another human being			0
' the attack left mr @entity7 hospitalised for a month and he had multiple skin grafts with tissue from his leg used to rebuild his damaged face			1
he is currently undergoing physiotherapy to heal his arm and must exercise his face to prevent him losing his facial expressions			2

i 've got permanent scars and it is all down my face , my arm , my shoulder , my back			2
medical experts fear the scars to mr @entity7 's face and side will take at least two years to heal police initially believed the attack was related to a road rage incident , but have since ruled that out mr @entity7 is undergoing physiotherapy to retain movement in his arm , and must exercise his face otherwise he will lose the ability to make facial expressions ' my skin feels like rubber now			1
i touch it and i think i have a mask on or something			0
' i have lost my job , i have had to move out because my mum gets upset and we argue			0
