' refusing the rights and responsibilities afforded by legal marriage sends the public a government - sponsored message that same - sex couples and their familial relationships do not warrant the status , benefits and dignity given to couples of the opposite sex , ' @entity29 wrote			1
' this court finds that @entity2 's same - sex marriage laws violate the @entity132 and @entity133 of the @entity134 because no state interest provides " excessively persuasive justification " for the significant infringement of rights that they inflicted upon homosexual individuals , ' he wrote			1
gov. @entity141 said in a statement sunday he was appealing to defend and uphold the law and the @entity144			1
couple @entity23 ( left ) and @entity24 speak during a news conference following a hearing in federal court in @entity22 as part of their lawsuit against the state 's gay marriage ban ' although the district court today may have been bound by the recent 9th @entity158 panel opinion , the status of that opinion and the law in general in this area is in flux , ' he said			1
state lawyers were reviewing @entity29 decision and working on the next steps to appeal			1
@entity163 , the executive director of the @entity164 of @entity2 , said @entity2 has no legal chance of prevailing at either the 9th @entity166 or with the @entity30 @entity67			2

' we 're disappointed but that 's not going to dampen our elation			0
' @entity23 said the appeal was ' ridiculous and futile			2
' he also called it misguided ' because it continues to injure same - sex couples who love each other and just want to get married			0
' if the state does appeal to the 9th @entity166 , chances of winning were slim since the federal appeals court already has ruled against @entity84 and @entity83 , which made similar arguments			0
@entity2 voters in 1998 approved a state constitutional amendment defining marriage as being between one man and one woman			2
but in the past year , the @entity30 @entity67 has struck down a provision of the federal @entity190 that prevented legally married same - sex couples from receiving a range of federal benefits			2
