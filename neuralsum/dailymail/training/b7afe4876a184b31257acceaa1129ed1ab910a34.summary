by @entity0 published : 11:24 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 02:46 est , 17 september 2013 policing @entity2 's streets can be a hazardous occupation - but it seems officers ca n't even drop their guard when they get back to the office			1
a series of bizarre office - based injury claims submitted by officers has shone a light on the extraordinary ' compensation culture ' a the heart of many police forces across the @entity2			1
in one staggering claim , a constable insisted he injured his back reaching to switch on a computer while another said he had hurt himself ' doing the washing '			0
hazardous : officers face a host of dangers - not only on the streets but also while performing mundane office tasks			2
( @entity28 picture ) among the hundreds of claims , revealed in a @entity31 request , was a @entity33 police officer who injured his foot after being ' run over by an office chair '			1
another police woman broke her toe after knocking over a table during a tactical training exercise and another suffered ‘ stinging eyes ’ after accidentally squirting hand gel into their face			0
the details emerged just a few days after it was revealed pc @entity46 , who planned to sue the owner of a petrol station after tripping on a kerb while investigating a break - in , has dropped her claim for damages			0
danger money : hundreds of police officers and staff have submitted injury claims against their force , according to information obtained under a @entity31 request she dropped her pursuit of damages in the hope that ' wider concerns the public may have ' can be resolved , according to the @entity67			1
ms @entity46 faced controversy last year after she filed a civil claim against @entity70 , the owner of the @entity72 's @entity71 , in @entity73 , @entity74 , demanding he reimburse the income she lost as a result of injuries sustained at the scene			2
claim : @entity79 @entity46 who tripped on a kerb in the car wash area of a filling station owned in @entity73 , @entity74 a recent report revealed that police forces have paid out and estimated £ 9m in compensation to their own officers for injuries at work over the past three years			1
@entity90 , chief executive of the @entity92 ’ @entity89 , said : ' this is yet further evidence that the compensation culture has got completely out of hand in this country			0
' policing is a difficult job that involves officers putting themselves at risk and some claims will have been perfectly legitimate and reasonable			0
' however , a number of these claims will either have been nobody ’s fault or could have been avoided with a bit of common sense : at the end of the day , accidents do happen			0
' taxpayers want to know that police forces are spending their money on frontline policing and keeping us safe , not settling spurious claims			2
' when police budgets are so tight and savings have to be found , people will be angry that so much of their cash is being spent on compensation and associated legal bills			2
' freedom of information requests asking about injuries to officers and staff in police stations were answered by 22 forces around the @entity2			1
in some case , forces refused to specify which injury resulted in a compensation payout for fear of identifying an officer			1
it is also not clear which claims were dismissed during the adjudication process			0
but a @entity67 spokesman said : ' it is only right that officers should be offered the same protection as anyone else who might be injured while at work , often through no fault of their own , and forces will only pay compensation if a claim is valid			2
' despite some forces omitting to state how the injuries were caused , bosses at @entity148 , @entity33 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 revealed the full extent of injuries over the past 18 months			1
@entity70 , pictured , said he was eager to move on from the ordeal which started when ms @entity46 tripped on this 6in kerb at the garage in @entity73 , @entity74 a retired police officer , who asked not to be named , said : ' it ’s not really the number of injuries that is the worry , it ’s more than trivial nature of most of them			1
' some officers ca n’t seem to make a cup of coffee or navigate their way past a desk without hurting themselves			0
' another officer , who has been in the job 10 years , laughed off the injuries , saying : ' you ’ve got to laugh really - it ’s like reading the script to a new @entity178 film			2
' how can an officer break their toe knocking over a desk during tactical awareness training ? it ’s not exactly a ringing endorsement you can do your job is it ? ' most of the police forces said that compensation claims were still on - going for a number of the incidents and that they would not reveal details of the exact claims as it could identify the officer or police staff member involved			1
