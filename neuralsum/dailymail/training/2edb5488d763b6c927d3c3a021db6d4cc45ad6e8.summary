by @entity0 published : 07:59 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 03:39 est , 8 november 2012 as the first blind person to reach the @entity3 on foot , @entity1 knows a great deal about overcoming adversity			1
but when he lost the use of his legs following a freak accident in 2010 , even he was n't sure he could come back from the brink a second time			1
' i did n’t get out of bed for six months , ' the adventurer told @entity15			2
' and after that i did n't do any exercise in just over a year			1
i was in a pretty dark place			2
i was n't sure i could bounce back			2
' back on his feet : @entity1 ( pictured in his wheelchair , left ) gets to grip with walking in the @entity23 suit ( right )			1
he was tethered at first to prevent falls yet just a year later he is taking 2,500 steps a day after becoming the first person in the world to own a £ 100,000 bionic suit			1
the robotic legs wrap around @entity1 's lower limbs and contain electric motors that power walking			1
sensors in the feet detect when he shifts his weight and sends this information to software held in a backpack , which then activates the legs			1
a pair of crutches completes the ensemble , which help him to balance			1
@entity1 , from @entity41 in @entity42 , says the impact of the new technology on his self - esteem has been dramatic			1
' when i stand i feel normal again , like i used to feel , ' he said			2
' psychologically i feel so much better after i ’ve been walking in the suit			2
plus i can hug my fiance on her level which is really important , ' he said			2
@entity1 was paralysed from the ribs down two years ago after falling out of a second - storey window			1
the accident left him ' in a pretty dark place ' for 18 months , before the determination that spurred him to travel around the world and to win two rowing medals at the @entity57 reasserted itself			1
' i thought the world had ended went i was blind at 22 , ' he said			1
' but i set myself goals			0
first i reached my bedroom door , then the @entity62 desert , then the @entity3			1
‘ i find if i set big and exciting goals it means i wo n’t focus on hardships			0
i also do n’t want to let down my supporters down			0
' it was thanks to fundraising by his supporters that he was able to purchase his own @entity72 robotic suit , after discovering the innovative company at the start of 2012			1
he travelled to @entity76 where he stood and took a few steps for the first time since his fall			1
' it felt like getting up after a long - haul flight , ' he said			0
' the muscles were very tight			0
' @entity1 was the first blind person to reach the @entity3 in 2009 ( left ) , he is now using an exoskeleton every day to see if it could improve the help of paralysed patients he is now taking part in a six - month clinical trial at @entity91 in @entity92 to see how walking in the suit affects the health of wheelchair - bound patients , but noted his ' heart and lung function ' had already improved			1
' i think it 's bad for you to be sitting all the time , ’ he added			0
' all your organs , everything inside you is compressed when you 're sitting			0
that puts pressure on certain organs and can cause heart , bladder , kidney and blood flow issues			0
' mr @entity1 believes that a combination of training , robotics and medical intervention , will one day return the use of his legs			1
' you have to accept where you are			0
i am in a wheelchair			0
but the exciting bit is the hope that something might change and that i can be part of the solution , ' he said			0
' i want to see if it 's possible to fix myself from the outside in			0
if it does n’t work for me i hope it will one day help other people			2
’ the @entity23 suit ( right ) can be worn by patients whose lower limbs are paralysed but who have the strength to transfer themselves to and from a wheelchair			0
it weighs 23kg with batteries but ' feels like a backpack ' according to @entity141 's @entity140 , because the weight is transferred through the frame to the floor			1
the two high - powered lithium batteries can be detached and charged at the mains in an hour			0
motors are located at the hips and knees			0
sensors in the feet detect any weight shifting			0
software held in the backpack uses algorithms to translate this into movement			0
a hand held computer is used to adjust the gait , including step height , speed of stride and stride length			0
the device costs £ 100,000 and the service charge is £ 6,000 a year			2
in the @entity167 there are six ' ambassadors ' who use an @entity141 suit regularly , and around 60 people have tested it in hospitals			1
there are three stages of training : 1 ) the therapist sets the step length and speed and operate the buttons to move the legs when they see the patient shifting their weight			2
2 ) the patient triggers the steps via buttons on the crutches , while shifting their weight while the physio acts as a spotter			2
3 ) the patient operates the legs solely by shifting their weight			2
currently a physiotherapist needs to be on hand while the suit is in use for safety reasons			0
the company hopes to have a device that can be used without supervision at home by 2014			0
@entity140 , clinical specialist physiotherapist at @entity72 , certainly believes in mr @entity1 's potential			1
' @entity1 is a unique character , nothing will stop him , ' he said			1
mr @entity1 certainly is n't remaining idle			1
he is also organising a 10 - day trip to @entity203 using a especially - customised hand bike			1
his charitable trust is also running simultaneous night - time running events in @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity42 to fund his continued rehabilitation and help other disability charities			0
and while he wo n't be taking part this time , mr @entity1 wo n't rule out joining the participants on the starting line in the future			1
‘ i am exploring the boundaries of what is possible			0
my desire is to run again , ’ he said			0
today is the last day you can sign up for the event on november 14			2

@entity1 went blind aged 22 but *trekked* to the @entity3 when he was *33*
the next year he lost the use of his legs following a freak accident
after *struggling* to motivate himself @entity1 came across @entity141 bionic suits
he now takes 2,500 steps a day using his own pair of robotic legs and is *planning* an *expedition* to @entity203
