now the current @entity1 is set to cash in on @entity2 ’s scandalous links with her great - great - grandmother by renting out his former home on the @entity18			1
the recently renovated @entity20 retreat has even been named @entity21 and can be hired for between £ 705 and £ 1,080 per week			1
nearly 120 years ago , the cottage was home to @entity2 , a servant who was at the centre of a row that even led the @entity26 to threaten to have his mother declared insane			1
in 1897 , queen @entity0 celebrated her @entity28 – the first @entity30 monarch to do so			0
but beyond the grand celebrations on @entity30 ’s streets , a war was raging between @entity0 and her court over her relationship with her @entity5 servant , mirroring that of her earlier friendship with her @entity40 servant , @entity39			1
originally one of two @entity5 selected to join the @entity1 ’s household , @entity2 rose from being a humble waiter to become @entity0 ’s most intimate confidant			1
arriving at court in 1887 , aged 24 , he introduced her to the delights of @entity5 cuisine , fed her romantic visions of @entity5 , and became her ‘ @entity49 ’ or teacher , giving @entity0 daily lessons in @entity52			1
queen @entity0 was 68 and had never recovered from the loss of her husband @entity54 26 years earlier			1
her only other close male confidant , her servant @entity39 , had died in 1883			0
the lonely @entity57 showered @entity2 with honours and promoted him over courtiers whose families had served the @entity61 for generations , sparking jealousy			2
and their @entity65 translation exercise books betray a flirtatious relationship			0
@entity67 , curator of the @entity68 , said : ‘ he wrote things like , “ @entity1 will miss the @entity71 very much			0
” it does seem quite personal and intimate			0
’ @entity0 ’s indiscreet affection caused consternation in the royal household , led by the @entity1 ’s private secretary sir @entity75 and her doctor sir @entity76 , who resented the ambitious young @entity5 upstart who was breaching all protocol			2
the @entity1 is set to rent out @entity2 's former home on the @entity18 ( pictured ) for up to £ 1,080 per week the interior of the three - bedroom cottage , which is set in the grounds of the @entity18 , is rather modern when her @entity84 in the sub- continent – the @entity86 – failed to reciprocate after being sent a @entity88 card from @entity2 in 1894 , he was rebuked by the @entity1 for snubbing her favourite			1
the @entity84 then sent an assistant , @entity90 , son of the @entity1 ’s private secretary , to look into @entity2 ’s background in @entity5			1
he had proclaimed himself the son of an @entity5 army surgeon , but it emerged his father was an apothecary at the local prison , where @entity2 himself had been a clerk			1
sir @entity76 revealed this to the @entity1 , telling @entity2 : ‘ you are an impostor			2
you are from a low class and never can be a gentleman			0
’ but @entity0 was livid , stating in a memo to her private secretary : ‘ to make out the @entity71 is low is really outrageous			0
’ she then expressed a wish to bestow a knighthood on her servant and on the eve of the @entity28 , threatened to pull out of the celebrations			0
@entity2 ( right ) came to @entity111 in 1887 to wait at the royal table at formal dinners			2
pictured left : a vintage illustration of @entity1 @entity0 on the arm of the @entity5 servant who ended up being a close male confidant after queen @entity0 's death in 1901 , @entity2 ( pictured together above ) retired to @entity5 until his death in 1909 her son @entity122 , the @entity26 , then encouraged dr @entity76 to deliver an ultimatum that : ‘ there are people in high places who know your majesty well who say to me that the only charitable explanation that can be given is that your majesty is not sane , and that the time will come when , to save your majesty ’s memory and reputation , it will be necessary for me to come forward and say so			1
’ the threat hit home and @entity1 @entity0 conceded defeat			0
there was no knighthood for @entity2 , though he remained at her side throughout the celebrations			2
however , when she died , in 1901 , he was dismissed from court and sent back to @entity5			0
in renting out three - bedroomed @entity21 , @entity18 advertises that ‘ the property was built by @entity0 for @entity146 ’			0
the advert adds that the property is available throughout the year ‘ with the exception of some weeks during the @entity150 ’ when it is believed it is used by courtiers and royal protection officers .			0
