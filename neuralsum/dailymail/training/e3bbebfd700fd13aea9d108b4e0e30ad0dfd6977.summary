by @entity0 published : 11:22 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 12:46 est , 8 october 2013 @entity1 has developed a ‘ crash - proof ’ car in a bid to help drivers avoid collisions with pedestrians or other vehicles			1
it ’ll even park itself			0
the new ‘ obstacle avoidance ’ technology means that if a pedestrian steps out , or if a slow moving vehicle looms into view , the car will take avoiding action if the driver fails to do so in time			1
the technology is being tested on a @entity32 and is expected to be on showroom models within five years			1
it has been tested at speeds of more than 38 mph following research which reveals that fewer than a third of drivers about to hit the car in front attempt to steer out of the way ahead of impact			2
the technology was demonstrated for the first time at the company ’s proving grounds at @entity46 in @entity47			0
the system uses three radars , ultrasonic sensors and a camera to ‘ scan ’ the road up to 200 yards ahead			0
a @entity1 spokesman said : ‘ if the system detects a slow - moving or stationary object in the lane ahead it first displays a warning and then sounds a chime			0
‘ then , if the driver does not steer or brake then the car will apply the brakes automatically whilst scanning for gaps either side of the hazard – effectively taking control of the electronic power steering to avoid any near - fatal collisions			1
‘ the automatic steering and braking enables the car to move away from objects that the driver may not have seen or that have slowed down ahead of them the car is also fitted with the next - generation parking technology which , at the push of a button , operates steering , gear selection and forward and reverse motion the automatic steering and braking enables the car to move away from objects that the driver may not have seen or that have slowed down ahead of them			1
the car is also fitted with the next - generation parking technology which , at the push of a button , operates steering , gear selection and forward and reverse motion			2
it can even be operated from outside the car by remote control			0
@entity96 , @entity98 ’s vice president of product development said : ‘ there are many instances – such as unexpectedly queuing traffic ahead – when this technology could benefit both the driver whose car is equipped with the technology and others on the road			2
‘ the @entity109 research project offers an exciting glimpse of a safer future where the risk of some types of accidents could be greatly reduced			0
’ the technology is being tested on a @entity32 and is expected to be on showroom models within five years she added : ’ @entity1 has always been one of the world ’s leading pioneers and forward - thinkers			1
‘ from the introduction of a whole new way of mass producing cars 100 years ago to the advanced safety and convenience features unveiled today , we continue to set the template and define the future for drivers			0
’ @entity1 is leading a consortium of 29 partners in a research project called ‘ @entity135 ’ - @entity136 by @entity137 – designed to make cars intervene in the event of an imminent collision .			2
