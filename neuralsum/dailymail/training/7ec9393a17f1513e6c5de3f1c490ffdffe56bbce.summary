to mitigate the environment destruction caused by quarrying , the people living near the wawa dam ( former water reservoir ) , planted a forest of mahogany trees judge @entity84 , from the @entity85 said , ‘ we were impressed by the variety of entries this year , in both subject matter and geographical location			1
‘ there was some stiff competition in the adult category , and some great images from the younger age group too			1
‘ it was refreshing to see some unusual and imaginative interpretations of this year ’s theme , and especially some which related the theme to man as well as animals			2
’ one of the stand - out images is of bison walking past a spring in @entity63			1
according to @entity84 , speaking to @entity105 , the colours in the spring are natural and arise from chemicals and the algae within the water			2
‘ it ’s obviously quite a hostile environment , which particularly struck us , ’ he said			2
‘ the colours and shapes and composition are interesting in that picture			2
‘ and it ’s good to see bison in the frame , to give you a sense of scale and also how animals can survive in extremely hostile environments			0

‘ jellyfish are the main food of marine turtles , that ’s what they routinely eat , ’ he explains			0
‘ what was particularly arresting about that image was the colours in it			0

this incredible image was taken by @entity178 at home in @entity180 on the right , a chick embryo in a hardened eggshell is sustained until full development			0
on the left , a tarsier is pictured in its natural habitat in another image parasitoid wasps - those that spend a large party of their life attached to another organism – are shown making ‘ clay pots ’			2
according to the photographer @entity74 : ‘ parasitoid wasps expend a lot of effort in providing a good start for their offspring : not only do they build shelter in form of intricate clay pots but they also provide food in the form of paralysed caterpillars			0
‘ the caterpillar needs to be just the right size to fit through the narrow opening of the pot to reach the growing larva inside			0
‘ in the picture , several stages of this behaviour are shown : in the bottom left a wasp is busy adding a ` mouthful ' of clay to the rim of an almost finished pot. another wasp is just about to feed in a caterpillar through the opening of the pot , and the wasp in the bottom right is sealing the opening			0
