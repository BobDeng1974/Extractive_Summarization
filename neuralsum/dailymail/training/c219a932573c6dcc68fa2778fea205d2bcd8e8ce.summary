by @entity0 published : 07:35 est , 7 september 2012 updated : 09:33 est , 7 september 2012 it is perhaps one of the greatest gifts a mother could give			0
a woman in her 50s has given birth to her own grandchild after becoming a surrogate mother for her infertile daughter			1
@entity11 , 53 , gave birth to a healthy baby girl a week ago who will now be brought up by her 32 - year - old daughter @entity13			1
the greatest gift : @entity13 with her pregnant mother @entity11 , who was a surrogate for her daughter special bond : @entity11 holds her granddaughter @entity19 less than a week after giving birth to her unconventional family : six - day old @entity19 is cradled by both her mother and her grandmother , blissfully unaware of how she came into the world @entity13 was 29 when she discovered two years ago she had cervical cancer			1
however , just as she was about to have a radical hysterectomy , @entity13 and husband @entity26 discovered she was pregnant			1
faced with saving her own life or their unborn child 's , the young couple made the excruciating decision to go forward with her surgery			0
it meant losing the baby , and forfeiting any chance at having their own children			1
remembering the moment she discovered she no longer had a place where a baby could grow , @entity13 said : ' i ca n't describe what that was like after finding out you have cancer , after finding out your chance of ever carrying a baby is gone			1
' however , hope arrived in the form of mother @entity11 , who offered to act as a surrogate for the couple			1
and last week , @entity13 and @entity26 waited patiently in the maternity wing of a downtown @entity55 hospital to realise their dream of becoming parents			2
just days after @entity13 's 32nd birthday , baby @entity19 was born			1
new mother : @entity13 , who was left infertile after having a hysterectomy , feeding her newborn daughter @entity19 ' better than i could have imagined ' : @entity11 holds her tiny granddaughter @entity65 after giving birth to her an in - vitro baby boom began about 34 years ago when @entity68 - the world 's first ' test tube ' baby - was born in @entity71			1
what started with would - be mothers in their 20s and 30s , began to extend to older women too			0
dr @entity76 , director of the in vitro fertilisation program at the @entity78 , said : ' then people started pushing the envelope			0
' if you could help a menopausal woman in her 30s , could you help a menopausal woman in her 40s ? and then it became , " can you help a menopausal woman in her 50s ? " ' and the answer is yes			0
' some older women were having their own babies			0
but more often , they were using egg donors to have their own children , or serving as surrogates or ' gestational carriers			0
' proud father : @entity96 watches his wife @entity13 hold their six - day - old daughter @entity19 @entity13 , left , examines the pregnant belly of her mother			1
@entity26 and @entity13 get used to being parents , right a 51 - year - old grandmother in @entity104 gave birth to her twin grandchildren in 2007 , and there were other stories of women giving birth in their 40s or 50s and even 60s			1
@entity11 had a vague recollection of those stories			2
so when doctors revealed that they had been able to keep @entity13 's ovaries intact , she immediately offered to help , asking : ' what if i carried your baby for you ? ' @entity13 and @entity26 did n't take it too seriously at first			1
' we did n't really think that was a realistic option , ' says @entity13 , who works in hospital administration			2
however , for a young grandmother in good health , like @entity11 , it became a viable option			2
after a process that included psychological evaluation and hormonal manipulation to prepare their bodies , @entity76 eventually implanted @entity11 's uterus with an embryo created with an egg from @entity13 and @entity26 's sperm			1
a woman 's fertility falls after the age of 30 and even more sharply after 35			0
and the older you are when you conceive , the greater the risk that your baby could have a genetic anomaly			2
this could lead to miscarriage or to the birth of a baby with @entity149			2
underlying conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure makes it more risky for you and your baby			0
older women are more likely to have such a condition , making some pregnancies potentially more risky			0
research also shows that , in mother of 40 or over , the proportion of babies born prematurely or with a low birth weight is greater			2
source : @entity163 it was no easy process , with a regimen of hormonal shots			0
work schedules were interrupted and vacations postponed			0
@entity11 , a executive director at a medical foundation in @entity55 , said : ' the thought of @entity13 and @entity26 not being able to have children and share that piece of their lives with someone just broke my heart			1
' i want @entity13 to have that connection with another human being like i had with her			2
' as her belly grew , people started asking @entity11 about ' her baby			1
' however she was quick to correct them and reveal she was actually carrying her grandchild			0
while admitting she was worried about the physical toll a late pregnancy might take , @entity11 said her body handled it better than she expected			2
she also wondered how well she 'd bounce back from a caesarean section			0
that 's how she had delivered @entity191 and her older brother , but that had been three decades ago			0
still , she reassured @entity191 and @entity26 throughout the pregnancy that the baby was fine , she was fine , everything would be fine			0
@entity26 often teased his mother - in - law each time they 'd take her to dinner or do something nice for her			1
he asked : ' are we even yet ? ' , to which @entity169 laughed and replied : ' not yet			0
' in truth , @entity26 and @entity13 knew there 'd really be no way to repay this kind of gesture			2
@entity13 added : ' this is a continuation of everything that she has done her entire life for me , which is to make sure that i have the best life possible			2
' cindy with her daughter @entity13			1
despite the risks of older women having babies , the 53 - year - old said she would consider doing it again while admitting she was worried about the physical toll a late pregnancy might take , @entity11 said her body handled it better than she expected all they could do , they said , was to promise to raise their baby as best they could			1
and that was enough for @entity11			0
@entity11 added : ' i know i gave a gift			1
but i 'm also getting so much in return			0
' last week , a few days after @entity13 's 32nd birthday , daughter sat next to mother , holding hands in the delivery room			1
' she looks just like you ! she looks just like you ! ' @entity13 shouted , running from the delivery room to introduce their newborn to @entity26			0
@entity11 , who is recovering well , even said she would consider doing it again			0
she added : ' when i watch both of them hold that baby and look into her face , it 's like everything i could have imagined wanting for them - better than i could have imagined			1
' this is what it was all about for me			0

@entity13 lost her chance of being able to conceive when she was forced to have a hysterectomy
however , doctors saved her ovaries and mother @entity11 offered to carry her daughter and *son* - in - law 's embryo
@entity11 gave birth to a healthy baby girl who will now be brought up as her granddaughter
