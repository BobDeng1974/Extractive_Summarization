@entity2 ’s @entity1 captain @entity0 has dismissed any suggestion that some of his team ’s support for a @entity8 vote in the @entity10 referendum will dilute their commitment to the @entity12 cause next year			1
@entity13 will be the opposition for march ’s first round , which will take place in @entity18 ’s @entity17 , with @entity19 already confirming that he will be leading @entity2 as it embarks on its second straight @entity21 campaign			1
at least two of @entity19 , his brother @entity22 and @entity23 , are likely to be picked in what will be the first tie since their last - gasp tweeting of support for @entity10 independence on the day of the vote itself			1
@entity0 ( left ) insists that @entity19 ( right ) will still ' work his arse off ' for @entity2 @entity19 , despite being a proud @entity33 , has always played for @entity12 too @entity0 , who is also @entity10 , insisted that the players will be as passionate as ever about representing the @entity35 as a whole , despite them being in favour of its break - up			1
the former @entity41 champion appears to have made his mind up only on the final day of the debate , and has since said he regrets how he expressed his view , having insisted throughout that he would keep any thoughts to himself			2
‘ i think you will see him pull the shirt on and work his arse off , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ everyone will see their pride when the national anthem plays			0
you can feel very @entity10 and be proud of @entity2			1
he will fight one hundred per cent in the @entity35 shirt and tracksuit like he always does			0
’ the decision to host the tie in @entity10 is unconnected to their views , and more down to the availability of the venue at relatively short notice and the fact that previous ties in @entity18 have been very well supported , even when the former @entity41 champion has not played			0
@entity19 ruffled some feathers with his tweet in support of @entity10 independence , but later regretted it @entity19 ( left ) , along with his brother @entity22 , will both play in the @entity1 for @entity2 ‘ the right to express yourself on something like this is okay			1
we had the biggest political debate in our history and there was a huge wave of national debate			0
there was the opportunity to do something different and it did n’t happen			0
life goes on and it feels like a lifetime ago , everything is going on as normal			0
’ @entity85 and @entity23 – both of whose careers have considerably benefitted from the specialist coaching and support that has come from being part of @entity2 – will be in contention to partner the world number six in the doubles rubber , as will @entity95 @entity94			1
@entity96 , another @entity95 , is in pole position to play the second singles			0
@entity0 said that it is likely that an indoor hard court will be the surface used for the tie from march 6 - 8			2
‘ when we have played in @entity10 before the atmosphere has been excellent and it ’s important that @entity10 gets to see world class tennis , there ’s a lot of world class tennis down south for people to watch so it ’s good that it gets to other places			2
’ @entity19 is currently in @entity95 preparing for next week ’s @entity114 .			0
