travellers are currently unable to choose a seat until they board the plane			0
@entity6 is to trial allocated seating on selected routes in the spring , following a similar move by rival @entity10 the allocated seating plan should end the stampede that usually precedes @entity6 boarding times those who have purchased speedy boarding or are travelling with young children have priority , but even there is no guarantee of a particular seat			1
the trial of allocated seating is seen as another step on the road to increasing @entity6 ’s appeal to business customers			1
shares fell 3 per cent following today ’s update			0
@entity10 currently charges a fee for a seat in the front row and has recently extended its reserved seating trial on 80 routes			1
although the move has not made the airline 's 25 - minute turnaround any longer , a spokesman said the carrier has no plans to extend the programme to the entire plane			1
the majority of passengers taking part in @entity6 ’s trial are not expected to pay for their seats , although the airline has admitted it plans to charge for popular spots such as the first few rows and seats over the wings			1
chief executive @entity58 said it was too early to specify how much passengers would have to pay for the option , nor had the airline decided which routes would take part in the trial			1
she told the @entity65 the trial was dependent on positive customer feedback and added : ‘ if it increases boarding time we wo n’t do it			2
’ @entity58 , @entity6 chief executive , says the airline is looking at whether allocated seating increases boarding time			2
meanwhile , founder sir @entity73 has pushed for higher shareholder dividends the news comes as the airline revealed a rise in profits today but warned it will become harder to pass higher fuel prices on to passengers			2
the group reported a 31.5 per cent increase in underlying profits to £ 248 million in the year to september 30 , which was at the upper end of expectations , after a sharp rise in the number of business passengers			2
it said around 45 per cent of winter seats are already booked - about the same level as last year - but warned that weak consumer confidence across @entity92 will slow the rate at which higher costs can be passed on to passengers			2
the record profits for the group came after it offset a £ 100 million increase in its fuel bill by focusing on cost controls and improved customer satisfaction levels			0
its on - time performance improved by 13 percentage points to 79 per cent			0
but the group warned the macro-economic environment remains challenging , while it is facing higher costs , including increased taxation and a £ 220 million rise in its fuel costs			0
as a result it is taking a ' cautious approach ' to expanding its fleet , which will lead to unchanged capacity in the first half of its financial year and growth of around 4 per cent for the year as a whole			0
@entity10 has already begun allocating seats - and charging extra for the front rows it expects first - half passenger revenues to increase by ' mid-single digits ' , helped by higher bag charges and other ancillary revenues			1
the group announced payments to shareholders of £ 195million , which is about £ 5million more than previously expected amid pressure from its founder sir @entity73 , who along with his family is a major shareholder			0
the @entity137 - based airline has been expanding its appeal to business customers , which tend to provide higher profits , by flying more to business routes and offering flexible fares			0
passengers travelling on business routes increased by one million to 9.5 million in the year			1
total revenues rose 16 per cent to £ 3.5 billion while revenues per seat were up 3.4 per cent to £ 55.27 , helped by a rise in ancillary revenues			0
@entity149 , an analyst at @entity150 , said @entity58 's first full year in charge had been a good one			0
but he added : ' cost inflation looks to be greater than we had thought and pricing is n't strong enough to compensate - the upshot is that our full - year 2012 forecasts may have to be reduced			0

trial of *pre-determined* seating will start on selected routes in the spring
it follows similar move by rival @entity10
passengers could be charged extra for popular spots such as the first few rows
