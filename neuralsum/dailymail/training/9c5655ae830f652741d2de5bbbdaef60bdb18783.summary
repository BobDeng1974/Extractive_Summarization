only one child of an @entity2 veteran is alive today and receiving pensions for their parents ' service , a veteran 's affairs spokesperson exclusively told @entity10			1
though it was widely reported this week that two children of the veterans were getting an annual $ 876 pension from the @entity16 , spokesman @entity11 said that one of the two , a 93 - year - old man living in @entity19 , died last august			1
the @entity2 ended on april 12 , 1865 with the surrender of the @entity21 , putting an end to the bloodiest battles ever fought on @entity25 soil			2
historic : two children of @entity2 soldiers still receive pensions from the government in the sum of $ 876 per year ; here , casualties from 1862 's @entity33 are pictured mystery : the two children wish to remain anonymous ; one lives in @entity19 and the other in @entity37 ; they were likely born in the 1920s or 1930s while the names of the two children have not been disclosed for privacy reasons , the male who passed away lived in @entity19 and was born around 1920			1
the other , a woman , was born around 1930 and lives in a nursing home in @entity37			1
speaking to @entity10 by phone from the @entity16 's @entity47 headquarters , mr @entity11 said : ' the @entity16 provided benefits to two children of the @entity2 veterans for the last several years			1
' one unfortunately passed away last summer at the age of 93			0
' the story of the veterans came to light this after a larger report was published about the lingering costs of war and veterans ' pensions on the 10th anniversary of the start of the war in @entity62			0
famous last : @entity63 , the last @entity64 widow , @entity63 , passed away in 2003 , aged 93 ; she married husband at age 18 when he was 81 @entity67 of the @entity68 , which represents women whose fathers fought for the @entity71 during the conflict , told @entity10 that the surviving child qualified for benefits because she was disabled before she turned 18			1
‘ she is mentally challenged and has a bad limp but i do n’t know if she was born that way or if something happened , ’ ms @entity67 said			0
veteran : @entity80 was the last surviving @entity64 soldier and died in 1956 at the age of 109 ' she is unable to communicate enough to even care for herself and her mother put her in a home before the mother passed away			1
she 's been in this care home for the rest of her life with her little @entity2 pension from her dad			0
‘ if she never married then she would have received this benefit for her entire lifetime , which it seems she has '			0
ms @entity67 added that she did not know which home the woman was in , or where exactly in @entity37 it was , as the historian who had kept her up to date died last year			2
the pension - holders ' fathers would have had to have been in their 70s or 80s if they served in the @entity2 , meaning that it is likely they re-married at an older age			1
the last verified @entity2 veteran , @entity80 , was 109 when he died in 1956 , while the last @entity2 widow , @entity63 , passed away in 2003 , aged 93 , though some dispute that she was the last living widow			1
mrs @entity63 had married her husband , @entity110 , when he was 81 and she was 18 and received a $ 70 pension check monthly			0
in earlier times , it was not unusual for much older men to marry much younger women , especially those who were widowed and needed support , or even those who were hoping to secure property and assets			0
marrying age for women was also much lower – sometimes even in the teens			0
@entity124 reference chief @entity123 told @entity125 last year that those in the @entity2 era requiring pensions had to prove their relationship to the soldier in question			2
surviving : according to the benefits roster of 2011 , there are only two children left from @entity2 soldiers , and 63 from the @entity136 of 1898 ‘ @entity2 pensions are especially fascinating because of the wide array of things people submitted as evidence , ’ he said , adding that there could be anything like marriage certificates , diaries , or photographs to prove that the women and children were related to the soldier in question			1
circumstances similar to the two pensioners allow for the grandchildren of president @entity154 , who was born in 1790 , to be alive today			0
his grandsons , @entity156 and @entity157 were born nearly 140 years after their grandfather , the 10th president of the @entity25 more than $ 40billion each year is spent on compensation for veterans of the @entity136 of 1898 , @entity162 , the @entity163 , the @entity164 , the two @entity62 campaigns , and the war in @entity167			0
during the @entity2 , 617,000 @entity25 were killed – approximately the same number as those who died in all of the wars up to that point , including the @entity171 and the @entity172			2
