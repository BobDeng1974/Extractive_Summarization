by @entity0 we are constantly having the virtues of the first meal of the day extolled to us			2
yet the average @entity4 is spending juts six minutes and 15 seconds rushing through breakfast each morning , even though the majority ( 82 per cent ) agree it ’s the most important meal of the day			1
busy lives and hectic work schedules have been blamed on an increasingly blasé attitude towards breakfast with a worrying portion of the population ( 15 per cent ) forgetting to eat their morning fuel and a further 34 per cent not eating in the am at all due to inconvenience			1
many of us blame hectic schedules and busy lives for not having time for breakfast over a third of @entity21 ( 37 per cent ) are choosing snooze over food admitting that they would rather have longer in bed than ‘ waste ’ time eating a good morning meal			1
furthermore , nearly two thirds ( 64 per cent ) of @entity21 highlighted that if they were able to make more time in the morning , they would be more inclined to make themselves a healthy breakfast			1
breakfast is often cited as the most important meal of the day it ’s not all doom and gloom though , as those who do make the time for breakfast are more likely to do so whilst listening to music , with 86 per cent admitting that listening to music in the morning perked them up for the day ahead			1
weekends see the nation take the most time out to enjoy breakfast , with a lengthy 13 minutes and 2 seconds spent around the breakfast table on saturdays and sundays			1
pop music topped the genre chart as the number one morning mood lifter ( 60 per cent ) , with @entity48 ’ viral hit ‘ @entity49 ’ ( 25 per cent ) named as the @entity52 ’s ultimate track to accompany breakfast			2
commenting on the study , neuroscientist dr. @entity54 , co-author of ‘ @entity55 ’ , noted : ' music is one of the very best tools available to every one of us , enabling us to shift our brains into a different gear			0
its mood - altering impacts are extremely well supported by decades ’ worth of scientific research			0
using music to get us into the habit of making a little extra time each morning to give our brains the right fuel to kick start our day can only be a good thing			2
' he continued : ' a nutritious breakfast is also brilliant for brain - hacking , which refers to simple adjustments to our behaviour that get our brains working better			0
for instance , substituting traditional milk with a product like @entity79 ( a calcium enriched oat drink ) reduces your intake of saturated fats			0
' a simple brain hack like this helps you to avoid clogging up your blood vessels in the long run			0
' the @entity90 says : ' apart from providing energy ( calories ) to kick start your day , a healthy breakfast provides essential goodness or ‘ nutrients ’ that the body needs such as fibre , vitamins and iron			0
' research has shown that people who eat breakfast have more balanced diets than those who skip it , are less likely to be overweight , lose weight more successfully if overweight and have reduced risk of certain diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes			0
' the research by oat - based milk alternative @entity79 looked into the morning eating habits of the nation ahead of their first breakfast festival – @entity116 – where on august 30 the meal will be brought back into the nation ’s hearts and stomachs through a marriage with music .			2

over a third of us chose to snooze our alarm rather than have breakfast
inconvenience and hectic work schedules blamed for skipping it
