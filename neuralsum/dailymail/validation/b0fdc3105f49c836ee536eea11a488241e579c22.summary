@entity1 youngster @entity0 has been snubbed by @entity3 under - 19s manager @entity2 because he is a ' luxury ' player who is n't big enough			1
the young @entity4 travel to play three games against @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 in the @entity9 under - 19s championship			1
highly - rated forward @entity0 who has netted three goals for @entity1 in this season 's @entity11 , is midway through a five - year deal at the @entity14 , and can count former club legend @entity15 as one of his coaches			1
@entity1 youngster @entity0 in action against @entity19 in the @entity11 match @entity3 under - 19s manager @entity2 has left @entity0 out of his squad for the upcoming games among @entity0 's coaches at @entity1 are former @entity25 international @entity15 ( centre ) he 's already been linked with a move to both @entity27 and @entity28 , but that has n't been enough to earn him a spot in the squad , despite playing in the qualifiers in @entity33			1
however , former @entity34 boss @entity2 has explained it 's nothing personal with the 19 - year - old , he 's just gone for a more physical approach , despite @entity0 standing at over 6ft tall			1
@entity2 explained : ' our concentration is on the opening game with @entity6 and we 've deliberately got more height in our squad			1
that 's one of the reasons why @entity0 is n't in			1
' unfortunately , i do n't see enough of him in action			0
the last time he was with us , he did ok , but i wanted a little more impact			0
at @entity1 he can float all over the place , which he does			2
but with us , he has to be more disciplined			0
' he 's an exceptionally gifted lad , but sometimes we ca n't carry him			0
he can be a luxury sometimes			0
in some cases , if it 's going well , he can be a good luxury			0
' highly rated forward @entity0 has already been linked with moves to @entity28 and @entity27 but the @entity58 @entity28 reserve team coach still believes @entity0 has a big future ahead of him			1
@entity2 stressed : ' listen , @entity0 's time will come			1
the last time i spoke to him , he wanted to really settle in at @entity1 and find a place there			2
that 's been a big thing for him			0
' i 've gone with the boys i 've seen most in the last six months			0
we keep tabs on @entity0 and see video clips of him			2
we have people over there who keep their eye on him			0
' there are others i 've left out like @entity76 at @entity77 who will have gripes that they 're not in the squad			2
' but i 've picked a group of 18 which will hopefully do well for us			0
it 's my opinion and i 'm not saying it 's right			0
but the squad i 've picked is an extremely strong one			2
' i can only pick 18 when i really could have picked 26 or 27			0
i 've gone for a physical side and runners			2
' it 's purely tactical and there certainly has n't been a lack of enthusiasm from @entity0 about playing for @entity3			1
' @entity0 is currently midway through a five - year deal with @entity1 and is tipped to have a big future			1
