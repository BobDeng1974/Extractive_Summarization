the @entity1 killer murdered six people may 23 , but some of his 50 - plus shots also hit and injured a dozen others and one of those survivors has now spoken out about what it was like to live through @entity11 's rampage			1
@entity12 , 22 , was riding her bike to a friend 's house that fated friday when she felt a pain in her thigh and pulled over			1
she thought the shots she heard were just fireworks at first , but when the pain hit her , so did an horrific realization			0
' that guy tried to f * * * * * g kill me , ' she told animal @entity24			0
@entity12 was lucky and did n't even require surgery after the bullet passed through her thigh , but she says the experience has changed her but @entity12 was one of the lucky ones			1
unlike weihan @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , she got through the night alive			0
' it ’s my upper thigh			2
it ’s across the top , ' she told @entity24			2
' there are two holes because the bullet went through the top of my thigh			1
it did n’t hit a bone			0
it did n’t hit an artery			0
no surgery , no stitches			0
' @entity49 describes the next few minutes and hours as a battle to come to terms with what had happened , who had perished and how she and her flesh wound fit into the horrible scheme of things			1
' i watched @entity11 ’s @entity59 video a couple hours later			1
that was the moment when i realized someone tried to kill me			1
horror : @entity12 was riding her bike that fated friday night when she felt a pain in her leg and it slowly dawned on her that she 'd been shot ' he pulled over his car and pointed at me and shot			1
i thought i was caught in the crossfire			2
and it turns out he saw me , pulled over , and shot at me			2
' as the mourning for the slain continues and @entity49 moves on from the experience , she 's taking away two things from the experience : the convictions that gun laws must change and that women can no longer be victimized for not returning the advances of men			1
' we ’re not obligated to fulfill this male desire , ' she says			0
' and it angers me that people are hurt because this person was so narcissistic			0
' while she knows that small changes to gun legislation wo n't prevent the next @entity11 , she carloto questions the wisdom of doing nothing at all			1
' i ’m not gon na snap my fingers and make everything perfect and one law is not gon na make everything perfect			0
it ’s not gon na hurt , ' she says			0
' it 's just two holes			0
' ' it angers me that people are hurt because this person was so narcissistic that he felt that he should kill people who don ¿ t wan na have sex with him , ' says @entity12			2

@entity12 got away with a flesh wound after @entity11 's bullet entered and exited through the top of her thigh
she 's *speaking* out about her *terrifying* experience and how its *cemented* her views on gun control and *misogyny*
