killer : triple killer @entity1 , pictured , stabbed to death @entity2 , 66 , while allowed out of prison on day release a triple killer was allowed out on day release , leaving him free to murder a @entity7 in a decision today branded a ' catastrophic failure ' by the chief inspector of prisons			1
@entity1 stabbed to death @entity2 , 66 , while allowed out from @entity12 in @entity13 , where he was serving a 25 - year jail term for killing two men he believed were paedophiles			1
@entity1 had travelled to the home of former prisoner and convicted sex offender @entity21 in @entity22 in july 2013 , and filled a pillowcase with cash and family heirlooms in a robbery			1
mr @entity2 heard his neighbour 's screams and went to investigate what was happening , but was dragged inside by @entity1 , who slashed his throat			1
in a report drawn up in january last year but made public today , @entity31 , the chief inspector of prisons , highlighted a catalogue of failings that allowed @entity1 to be released			1
he said : ' the decision to release @entity1 had catastrophic consequences			1
' in a highly critical report , mr @entity31 warned that the system for identifying and managing prisoners released on temporary licence ( @entity42 ) are woefully inadequate			1
the number of prisoners serving indeterminate sentences , which are handed out to the most dangerous convicts , and allowed out on day release has increased from 38,000 to more than 90,000 between 2008 and 2012			1
but mr @entity47 said the systems for managing these offenders in open prisons ' lack clarity and are insufficiently robust '			2
he added : ' there is a general presumption in favour of granting @entity42			2
the purpose of individual releases is not clear , and there are insufficient safeguards to manage the risks presented by some higher - risk - of - harm prisoners			0
' wanted : @entity1 met convicted paedophile @entity21 , 88 , in prison , and during a subsequent manhunt he was last seen at this hotel cctv , released by police at the time attack : @entity1 burgled convicted sex offender @entity21 and neighbour @entity2 heard his neighbour 's screams and was dragged inside by @entity1 , who slashed his throat he said protection arrangements ' are not routinely reviewed when prisoners transfer to open prisons ' and ' risk assessment processes are inadequate '			1
a lack of competence and failures to share information are leading to ' indefensible releases ' , he added			0
@entity1 had a history of violent attacks towards men he suspected of paedophilia and had failed to return to prison after being allowed out on day release before			1
but despite these warning signs , poor leadership and a failure to properly assess the risk he posed meant officials waved through his day release in july 2013			1
the convicted killer failed to return to @entity12 while released for the day in december 2010			1
he went out drinking all day and returned to a man 's house where he was found by police called out to reports of two men having a row			1
@entity1 was arrested , but not charged , for being drunk and disorderly and returned to a closed prison			1
yet the following year the @entity100 recommended he was returned to an open prison			0
crime scene : @entity1 killed mr @entity2 at the home of @entity21 in the @entity22 village of @entity105 , near @entity106			1
he was on temporary day release from jail at the time of the murder mr @entity31 warned that officials had failed to appreciate @entity1 's dangerous ' pattern of drinking , identifying single male targets who he believed to be paedophiles and / or homosexuals , returning to their houses , getting involved in an altercation and attacking them '			1
despite these worrying signs , @entity1 was sent back to an open prison in march 2013			1
but his multi-agency public protection arrangements ( @entity124 ) were not properly reviewed on his return , and his new offender manager did not even see him before he was cleared for day release , the report found			1
mr @entity31 concluded : ' it was not appropriate to release mr @entity1 for the first time since his previous failure in 2011 for such a lengthy , unaccompanied , unstructured and unmonitored @entity42			1
' mr @entity1 's custodial behaviour was good and the prison had no security intelligence or concerns about his conduct			2
however , he presented a concerning risk profile			0
' he had previously been convicted of manslaughter and had committed at least one murder			0
he had failed open conditions twice before			0
this was his first opportunity to be released on temporary licence since his rotl failure in 2011			1
the risks he presented on @entity42 were not sufficiently assessed or managed			0
' @entity145 , also known as @entity146 , has been described as ‘ astonishingly bright ’ , with an iq of 140			0
born in @entity148 in 1958 , he spent much of his youth in care homes and picked up a string of convictions for petty theft and burglary			0
by his early 20s he was a drifter , reportedly earning money as a rent boy and sleeping rough when his cash ran out			0
he briefly married at 25 , but his marriage collapsed under the strain of his heavy drinking and his continued involvement in crime and prostitution			0
in october 1983 , he was stopped by police after crashing a stolen car in @entity166 while drunk			0
kept in a cell to sober up , he demanded to see the custody sergeant and told him : ‘ i ’ve done a bad thing			0
’ @entity1 had killed a gay man , @entity171 , smashing his skull seven times with a hammer before strangling him with a towel			2
at his trial , @entity1 told the jury that @entity171 , 49 , – who had previous convictions for sexually abusing teenage boys – had played him an audio tape describing a graphic sexual fantasy of having under - age sex with a teenage boy			1
@entity1 claimed he had ‘ panicked ’ and repeatedly struck out at @entity184			2
he said he had thrown the tape away			0
the jury convicted him of manslaughter , not murder , and he was sentenced to 13 years , reduced to eight on appeal			0
he was released in 1989 after serving only five years			0
just 17 months later he stabbed gay barman @entity189 , 55 , through the neck at his home in @entity192			2
in july 1992 , he was convicted of murder and given a life sentence , with a minimum tariff of 25 years			0
@entity1 ’s 25 - year minimum term would have meant he was eligible for release on licence in 2017 but he was moved to a @entity200 ‘ open resettlement prison ’ so he could prepare for life outside			1
