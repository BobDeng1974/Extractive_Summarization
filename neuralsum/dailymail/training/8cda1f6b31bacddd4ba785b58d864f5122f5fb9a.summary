@entity11 was denied permission to bring @entity14 husband @entity13 to the @entity15 , where she lives with their baby daughter , @entity16 , aged 21 months			1

mrs @entity11 , frustrated with the time her appeal against the decision was taking , decided to organise a family @entity7 reunion in @entity29 , where mr @entity13 had been granted a tourist visa			1
it was as mrs @entity11 and her daughter @entity16 were on a ferry crossing the @entity48 that she was told her mp , @entity50 @entity49 , had won her case			1
' it was amazing , the best @entity7 present , but i could n’t tell anyone because i was on a ferry , ' said mrs @entity11 , who also celebrated her 30th birthday on thursday			2
' when i eventually found @entity13 in the airport wandering around trying to find us , @entity16 ran up to him shouting ‘ @entity60 ! ’ - it was quite emotional			2
' mrs @entity11 met her 33 - year - old husband , in 2006 when she faced problems registering her visa as an @entity66 teacher in the @entity14 capital of @entity68			1
they married in 2011 and lived in @entity70 and @entity71			0
but when baby @entity16 arrived , the couple realised they needed the support of their family and decided to settle in @entity77 , where mr @entity13 's medical training could lead to a well - paid job			0
an application for a visa was submitted and mrs @entity11 returned to @entity82 where she began working for the family business @entity84 , @entity15 ’s only remaining traditional oak bark tannery still in production			0

mrs @entity11 had assumed her salary , savings and the offer of free accommodation and work would persuade the authorities that the couple were unlikely to become a burden on the state			0
nevertheless the request was denied , forcing her to book a trip to @entity14 in the summer , just so that @entity16 could see her father			2
the mother - of - one then also turned campaigner , petitioning her mp and @entity119 to overturn the government decision while helping other families who have been similarly affected in the @entity122			2
mr @entity13 has since received official notification that he must submit his passport to the @entity14 visa office , in @entity126 , where they will stamp it with permission to live in the @entity15 for two - and - a - half years			1
