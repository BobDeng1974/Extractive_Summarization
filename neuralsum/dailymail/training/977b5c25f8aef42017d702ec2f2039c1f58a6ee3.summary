dining in @entity0 can easily slip into a game of tapas roulette			1
or perhaps that should be pintxos roulette , as that is what the diminutive plates of bar food are called in this @entity9 region of northern @entity10			1
mrs @entity11 is not a seafood connoisseur			2
i first convinced her to try fish a decade ago - and she has become more daring			2
art and soul : the magnificent @entity18 gallery is @entity0 's most striking landmark but ' really fishy seafood ' , as she terms it , remains a challenge , which is problematic here			1
delicious plates of pintxos line every bar			2
and it 's not clear what they contain			0
and since most of the labels for these dishes are printed in @entity9 , with its excessive use of the letter x , it becomes almost impossible to tell what you are about to chow down			1
still , it 's hard not to love this form of dining - and harder still not to love @entity0			1
everything seems tasteful , with striking sculptures dotted here and there			0
even the graffiti on the main bridge in the centre of town looks like it 's been considered			0
we explore the back streets to the old town , and the fish market ( stopping for more pintxos ) , before heading back to our hotel along the wide riverside path the modern offices blend in seamlessly with the classic @entity10 buildings and large parks , such as at @entity60			1
our hotel - the splendid @entity0 - is a good example of this			1
every room has its own work of modern art , and it sits over the road from the @entity68			0
opened in 1997 , this dazzling titanium , granite and glass shell is a must for devotees of modern art and architecture			0
even before you enter , you are given a taste for the creativity / bonkers - ness that awaits inside , in the form of the 40 ft topiary puppy , by @entity82 , that sits outside			2
inside hang works by @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			0
hope you 're hungry : the @entity9 region is famous for its pintxos - but it helps if you have a liking for seafood but it 's the enormous rusted 10 ft - high walls of curved metal in the main hall that really catch our imagination			1
they have been sculpted to form waves that merge to form mazes that you can actually get lost in			0
later that day we take a trip up to the @entity103			0
this transporter suspension bridge , built in 1893 , is 200 ft high and still carries half a million cars and four million people from one side to the other every year in gondolas that hang from steel cables			0
it 's a staggering work of engineering and is a @entity113			0
fares start at about 35 cents - so plenty of change left over for another plate of pintxos			2
@entity120 ( 020 7593 2283 , www.kirkerholidays.com ) offers three nights ' b&b at the five - star @entity123 in @entity0 from Â£ 589 per person , including return flights , private car transfers and entrance tickets to the @entity18 , @entity119 guide notes to sightseeing , and the services of the @entity119 concierge .			1

@entity0 is a fine *alternative* *option* to @entity135 for a @entity10 city break
the largest city in the @entity139 is also famed for its food scene
@entity142 - the @entity9 version of tapas - are widely available and very tasty
