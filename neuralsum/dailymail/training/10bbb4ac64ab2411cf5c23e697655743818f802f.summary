nearly a million patients are heading to @entity2 every year because they can not get an appointment with their gp , figures reveal			1
data from the government ’s own survey provide fresh evidence that @entity10 ’s casualty ward crisis has been driven by the struggle to access a family doctor			1
@entity13 yesterday said the pressures would be eased by giving the over- 65s better access to @entity16 and more care at home – but conceded it would ‘ take time ’			2
however some doctors last night revealed that a drug - resistant strain of flu could be contributing to this year ’s @entity2 crisis			1
at least one hospital said it is seeing rising numbers of patients with the influenza a @entity40 virus , a severe strain that had mutated since a commonly - used vaccine was prepared			2
the political row over access to gps broke out over a @entity7 survey of 880,000 patients			1
it revealed that about one in ten were unable to get an appointment with a doctor or practice nurse when they last tried – a figure of 5.8 million patients if extended across @entity55			1
a further 7 per cent were offered appointments up to three weeks ahead – and said they gave up trying			0
of these two groups of patients , one in ten said they went to an @entity2 or walk - in centre in the hope of seeing a doctor sooner			1
across @entity55 , this is equivalent to about 940,000 patients – and a rise of almost 80,000 compared with calculations for last year			2
the prime minister told a meeting of business leaders in @entity70 that the problem was caused by a rising ageing population finding it ever harder to see a family doctor			2
parked side by side outside a @entity2 unit , 11 ambulances are forced to wait because casualty staff are too overwhelmed to accept patients			1
the picture , taken outside @entity82 hospital , exposes the scale of the crisis in @entity86 ’s @entity24 - run @entity85 – where waiting times are even longer than those in @entity55			2
such scenes are by no means isolated , either , and on monday there were 12 ambulances queuing outside the @entity93 in @entity94			0
@entity95 , leader of the @entity96 , blamed the crisis on a result of a ‘ vicious cycle ’ of under - funding by @entity24			2
struggling : ambulances - not all of them visible - queue at @entity82 ‘ despite the best efforts of dedicated @entity85 staff , ambulance response targets have not been met in @entity86 for several years and @entity2 waits continue to worsen on @entity24 ’s watch , ’ he said			1
the @entity109 last year revealed the scale of the @entity85 crisis in @entity86 , where patients have died on waiting lists and thousands are travelling to @entity55 for treatment			1
but problems persist in @entity55 itself , and it emerged yesterday that a hospital in @entity118 has asked for help from the @entity120 – better known for helping @entity122 disaster victims			2
the charity is providing two ambulances and a team of staff at the city ’s @entity127 , while bosses have also asked nurses in managerial roles to return to frontline duties			0
backroom staff have been shifted on to wards to do admin jobs for nurses			0
an unprecedented 13 @entity55 hospitals have declared major incidents as they struggle to cope , as @entity2 waiting times plunged to their worst in a decade and just 92.6 per cent of patients were treated within four hours			1
but the figure is even worse in @entity86 – at just 83.8 per cent			0
firemen have already warned that they were increasingly being asked to ferry patients to hospital instead of ambulances			2
it emerged yesterday that fire crews cut the ring off a stroke patient ’s swollen finger because an ambulance was not expected for five hours			0
he said : ‘ one blinding statistic is that there are a million more over- 65s going to @entity2 this year than there were four years ago			1
so we have an ageing population , greater numbers of frail elderly			0
’ @entity24 , which analysed the survey figures , blamed the government for under - investment in services to meet the needs of an ageing population			1
it said surgeries were too cash - strapped to open at evenings or weekends , employ extra doctors and nurses or open bigger premises			0
shadow health secretary @entity170 repeated his claim that the @entity85 will not ‘ survive another five years of @entity13 ’ , adding : ‘ he ’s made it harder to get a @entity175 appointment and it ’s getting even worse , contributing to the current crisis in @entity2			1
’ he claimed a @entity24 government would guarantee a @entity175 appointment within 48 hours and allow patients to book further ahead with a gp of their choice			1
from the @entity109 on december 23 but the @entity25 pointed the finger at the 2004 gp contract – negotiated under @entity24 – which enabled doctors to opt out of evening and weekend care			0
patients now have to navigate a confusing system of out - of - hours firms and walk - in centres – and many just go to @entity2 instead			1
a government spokesman said @entity24 was making another attempt to distract from the botched 2004 gp contract			0
‘ that ’s a real source of pressure on @entity2 , and one we ’re sorting out by introducing evening and weekend gp access for ten million people , ’ said the spokesman			1
figures from the survey also show a steady fall in patient satisfaction			1
a fifth say they are not happy with @entity175 opening hours			2
one in ten said receptionists were unhelpful and a quarter said it was difficult getting through on the phone			0
meanwhile separate figures show ambulance response times at their worst since records began in 2010			0
just 71.8 per cent of the most serious ‘ @entity216 ’ calls – cardiac arrests and road accidents – were reached in eight minutes			0
the target is 75 per cent			0
yesterday doctors also warned that a strain of flu not covered by seasonal vaccines is contributing to a significant rise in @entity2 admissions			1
specialists at @entity225 said the number of patients admitted with respiratory illnesses had doubled – half of which were found to have the influenza a @entity40 virus			0
dr @entity233 said the virus – a severe strain that had mutated since the vaccine was prepared – was adding ‘ significant strain ’ to stretched hospitals			0
colleague dr @entity239 said national cases were rising steadily and could continue for eight weeks			0
he said the ‘ flu season ’ began four weeks ago – earlier than last year , and admissions are up ‘ significantly ’ .			0
