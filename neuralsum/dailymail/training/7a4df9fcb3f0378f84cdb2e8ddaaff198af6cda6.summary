@entity0 says he wants to manage @entity1 one day			1
he talks of getting his badges and qualifications			0
in the meantime , he is working for @entity5			0
‘ i have to be able to make sure i have everything on board to be able to go back , ’ he says			0
@entity8 , a nice set of exams ? why would @entity1 appoint a novice to steer them through the difficult task of succeeding @entity13 ? @entity0 may be an @entity1 legend but he needs to prove himself as a manager , not a pundit by joining @entity5 , while doing his coaching badges , @entity0 has weakened his chances of managing his old club @entity13 signed the @entity19 forward in 1999 , but it seems unlikely he will be replaced by @entity0 we saw what happened at @entity23 when sir @entity24 stepped down and what was needed to replace him : one of @entity28 ’s most experienced elite coaches , @entity26			1
how can @entity0 prove @entity1 - worthy from his @entity5 studio ? @entity30 talks a good game , too — but the guys at @entity33 are not about to ditch @entity34 for him , no matter how many badges he has			2
ultimately , the test is to get out there and do it — at academy level , youth level , in the lower leagues , as an assistant			0
a former @entity44 hero , @entity43 , is doing just this at @entity46 , and if @entity0 was genuinely on the road to being @entity1 manager , his first appearance before the @entity5 cameras would involve having a microphone poked up his nose by @entity53			2
@entity0 is @entity1 's all - time leading goalscorer , and has been invited to come back to the club as a coach @entity13 has been under pressure this season , but is likely to see out the rest of his contract at @entity1 @entity60 showed what can happen when a club legend is not replaced by one of @entity28 's top coaches			1

@entity1 legend @entity0 has just joined @entity5 as a pundit
@entity0 says he would like to manage his former club one day
but he will not learn enough to succeed @entity13 from the studio
