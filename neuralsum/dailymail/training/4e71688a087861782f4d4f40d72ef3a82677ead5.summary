by @entity0 published : 05:32 est , 21 august 2013 updated : 04:06 est , 22 august 2013 somewhere in the shallows of the @entity3 , it probably dawned on him he was lost			1
the water did n’t taste quite so salty as it did a while ago and the fish he was chasing looked distinctly unfamiliar			1
@entity21 , about half a mile from the city centre and 20 miles from the open sea			1
not quite the kind of place you ’d expect to see a short - beaked common dolphin , perhaps – even one that ’s decided to take a city break			2
but just for the moment , @entity31 the @entity3 dolphin clearly likes it here on the border between @entity34 and @entity35 , entertaining spectators with leaping , clicking and flipping and displays just yards from a riverside walkway and cycle track			1
startled passers - by tweeted photographs of the show - off performance when @entity31 was first spotted on monday evening just west of the @entity35 border , which runs north to south across the river			2
he stayed overnight and was seen again at various points on tuesday , at one stage reaching a weir that is in sight of the ancient city walls			2
yesterday – after apparently heading out towards the @entity51 – he was back again			1
‘ i do n’t think it can decide whether to stay in @entity34 or @entity35 , ’ said @entity52 , operations director for the @entity54 charity , which is monitoring @entity31 ’s travels			2
‘ we want to make sure it does n’t get into trouble or become stranded on a bank , but at the moment it seems quite happy			2
‘ unless it gets into difficulty we do n’t need to intervene			2
’ the @entity66 : the dolphin has already earned himself several nicknames since he was first spotted @entity31 , whose more normal habitat is the deep water of the @entity72 or @entity51 , is believed to have broken away from a pod to chase or search for fish to eat			1
it appears he swam into the mouth of the @entity77 from @entity78 , then into the comparatively narrow stretch of river that runs between @entity21 and @entity81			1
onlookers saw him frolicking in the tidal waters and heard his distinctive ‘ clicking ’ noise as he swam near the weir and leapt into the air			1
‘ nobody really knows for certain why they do that , ’ mr @entity52 said			0
‘ he might have been having a quick look round to see where he was , maybe looking for his family or his prey … or sometimes it might just be a jump for joy			0
’ experts suspect low tide might have taken @entity31 by surprise – and that the current high spring tide , which dramatically increases the river ’s current , probably prevented him from heading back out to sea			1
watchful eye : a conservation group is keeping tabs on the dolphin to make sure it does not come to any harm rescue : despite efforts to save the @entity112 bottlenose , it had to be put down in 2006 a @entity113 captured the hearts of the @entity116 public and made headlines around the world when it swam up the @entity119 in the depths of winter			1
scientists believed the six - metre long female had got lost and was trying to head west towards the deep waters of the north @entity124 when it became stranded			0
she had not been able to feed for three days after swimming into the river and became severely dehydrated			0
despite a rescue operation , the sea mammal , a young adult , died as she was being taken back out to sea on a barge			1
in 2008 an eight - metre whale weighing nine stone beached itself on a mudflat in @entity135 , @entity136			0
the whale , which was also a @entity137 , was put down by lethal injection after suffering kidney failure			0
yesterday a study conducted by the @entity141 announced 708 seals had been spotted in the @entity143 in the first ever count by air , sea and land in which numerous volunteers and conservationists took part			1
although it is positive news for the south of the @entity34 , in @entity155 numbers of the harbour seal have declined sharply for unknown reasons			0
although common dolphins can swim at more than 35mph and can maintain high speeds for hours , they are deep water mammals and are unused to such powerful fluctuations			0
short - beaked common dolphins can weigh 440lb and grow up to 9ft long			0
most live an average of 17 years but some have reportedly survived to 50			0
it is likely @entity31 will find a way out ( or that he simply decides to cancel his holiday ) but coastguards have put a lifeboat on standby to aid his passage			0
should he become stranded , boat crews and animal welfare teams will hoist him from the water and return him to the deep			0
last night a watch was being maintained to ensure he did n’t leap the weir and head farther upriver – although he might struggle a bit if he got as far as its source in @entity181 , someone observed			0
conservation worker @entity182 , who has helped a long - running clean - up initiative for the river , said : ‘ over the past three or four years we have got rid of over a thousand sacks of rubbish			0
‘ it ’s a good job we ’ve done that , or he would have been swimming around with a plastic bag on his head ! ’ @entity192 : the dolphin has seemed quite undeterred by his unfamiliar surroundings			1

@entity196 undeterred by unfamiliar surroundings as he swam in to @entity21
it is thought the hungry mammal was chasing fish up the @entity3
he was seen happily jumping and frolicking before heading back to sea
