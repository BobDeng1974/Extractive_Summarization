by @entity0 history repeated itself on monday as @entity2 were forced to take @entity4 silver in the team table tennis at @entity6			2
just like in @entity8 four years ago , @entity7 were their conquerors with the reigning champions taking the gold with a 3 - 1 victory			1
@entity14 proved no healer for @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 as they were beaten at @entity20 , with a poor start coming back to haunt them			2
so close : @entity2 's ( left to right ) @entity18 , @entity17 , @entity16 , @entity23 and @entity24 with their silver medals @entity17 had the perfect chance to lay down an early marker as he led @entity28 1 - 0 and 2 - 1 but he ended up losing 3 - 2 , before @entity18 was brushed aside 3 - 0 by @entity29			1
@entity30 appeared to be at hand as @entity16 and @entity17 ripped through their doubles match to make it 2 - 1 overall but , when @entity28 dispatched @entity16 3 - 0 in 24 minutes , the game was up			1
it was not a case of twice bitten thrice shy for @entity17 , though , who remains intent on cracking the code in the @entity4 team event			2
' we are there or thereabouts , it 's just a couple of points either way but we 'll be back in four years and this will only make us more determined , ' he said			0
' this is a much stronger @entity7 team than four years ago			1
they 've brought in two new players who were not eligible in @entity8 and they really pushed on			2
not enough : @entity2 star @entity17 , pictured here playing a shot against @entity7 , could n't help his country to victory at @entity55 ' i think we 've closed the gap on @entity7			1
these guys are very experienced , some of them are @entity61 national team members			0
' we are just getting better and better and while they are coming to the end of their career , we are just starting to peak			0
' all three @entity2 players now head into the singles and doubles competition and @entity17 is ready for that			1
' i 'm playing well			0
i 've come into the tournament with confidence			0
i was n't playing at my best at the start but i 've slowly got into it and i can still get better , ' he said			0
' i really think there are three medals for me and i really want one of those golds and i believe we can medal in every event			0
i know we can beat every pair in the doubles			0
' champions : @entity29 and his @entity7 team - mates proved too strong for @entity2 in the final			1

@entity7 beat @entity2 3 - 1 in the final to win gold
the match was a repeat of the final in @entity8 four years ago
@entity17 is now *focused* on *challenging* in the singles competition
