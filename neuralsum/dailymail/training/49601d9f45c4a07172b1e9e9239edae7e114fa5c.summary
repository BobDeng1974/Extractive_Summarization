by @entity0 published : 12:38 est , 4 july 2012 updated : 01:45 est , 5 july 2012 more than 200 breastfeeding mothers descended on a cafe in support of one of their own who claimed she was verbally abused by a waitress for suckling her baby in public			1
@entity9 , 28 , claims she was told by a member of staff : ' do n’t you ever come back to my cafe with your t * * * out again ! ' when word spread about her ordeal , a @entity19 page set up by mothers calling themselves ' lactivists ' and ' mother suckers ' called on like - minded women to take a stand by deliberately breastfeeding there			1
show of strength : hundreds of mothers mobilise before descending on a cafe in @entity29 , where one woman claims she was verbally abused for trying to breastfeed her baby on the march : the group was assembled through a @entity19 page set up by mothers calling themselves ' lactivists ' and ' mother suckers ' cheered on by schoolchildren and monitored by policewomen on horseback , the group marched to the cafe to have it out with the owner			1
@entity9 said : ' what we did was a peaceful gathering , not a protest and we had a really good reaction from the police and the public			0
' a group of school children started clapping us and there were six policewomen on horseback to make sure no one drifted in the road			0
' @entity9 had popped out for lunch at the @entity54 in @entity29 , where she claims she was told by the waitress that if she wanted to feed her baby she would have to sit in the corner			1
breast is best : @entity9 leads the group to the cafe after claiming she was told never to come back there ' with your t * * * out again ' swamped : the protesters gather at the entrance of the @entity54 cafe , monitored by policewomen on horseback to ensure they did not stray into the road crossing the threshold : the first mothers enter the cafe to give the owner a ' peaceful ' piece of their mind on leaving , @entity9 , from @entity74 , @entity29 , told two customers about the cafe 's breastfeeding policy who promptly turned around and left			1
@entity9 claimed she then walked a few minutes down the road when she was pursued in a car by a waitress at the cafe who screamed : ' do n’t you ever come back to my cafe with your t * * * out again ! ' @entity9 , who works in procurement at the @entity89 , said : ' when this happened , i was absolutely terrified and really shocked			2
i was only breastfeeding , and @entity29 is a really family - friendly city			0
' you see girls in nightclubs barely wearing any clothes all the time , so why would someone have a problem with me feeding my child ? ' i turned around and said to her “ you do n’t know what ’s coming " even though at this stage i had no idea we were going to assemble in the cafe			0
' sit - in protest : the cafe 's owner was really apologetic and gave everyone a free tea or coffee and a free cake taken aback : @entity9 ( right ) was initially told to breastfeed in the corner when she first went for lunch at the cafe and told others about her ordeal , prompting word to quickly spread taking a stand : @entity121 makes her point by breastfeeding her baby during the sit - in protest although @entity9 was distressed by what had happened , she decided not to pursue anything			1
@entity9 had never met the person who started up the @entity19 page , but word spread about her ordeal very quickly			2
she said : ' the cafe 's owner was really apologetic and gave everyone a free tea or coffee and a free cake			0
' he ca n't help it if one of his staff was rude to me and he has now put up a sign saying " @entity140 is allowed in here "			0
' @entity142 , 35 , general manager of the @entity54 , said : ' we want to make it clear that we welcome all mothers and we have women breastfeeding in here on a daily basis			0
' it 's not company policy for us to make women breastfeed in the corner			0
this was simply an isolated incident due to a misunderstanding			2
' apologetic : cafe owner @entity142 said the nicident involving @entity9 was a misunderstanding and has now put a sign up saying breastfeeding is welcome			1

@entity9 was first told to ' suckle baby in the corner ' when she went to cafe for lunch
then claims waitress left her ' terrified ' after verbally abusing her as she walked down road
as word spread , a @entity19 *campaign* *mustered* 200 breastfeeding mothers to take a stand
cafe owner apologises for ' isolated incident due to a misunderstanding '
he has now put a sign up saying : ' breastfeeding is allowed in here '
