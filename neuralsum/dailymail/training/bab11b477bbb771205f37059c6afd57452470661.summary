i ’m ready for the challenge , so i ’ve officially applied for the job			1
i want to be the next manager of @entity4			1
but @entity6 ’s sacking at the @entity7 at the weekend shows how incredibly difficult it is to make it in football management in this country			1
less than a year after winning a trophy at @entity14 , with three promotions under his belt , @entity6 was axed			1
@entity6 left @entity4 at the weekend following their 3 - 0 defeat at @entity19 ferguson with the @entity20 after @entity4 's @entity14 win in march 2014 he ’s had to sell top players , but still sustain a challenge in those circumstances			1
this season results have been terrible since october , but three of his key signings – @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 – have been injured for large chunks of the campaign			2
@entity4 is not a football hotbed			1
attendances at @entity34 , the home of @entity4 , are awful			1
under 6,000 was the average last season , and in the championship the previous season it was just over 8,200			0
that income is n’t enough so @entity4 have to make their own money by signing players on the cheap , and selling them for big profit			1
if this is successful , the policy works , and the club flourishes			0
@entity6 ’s sacking is unfathomable when you put it into the wider context , when you take time to look beyond a run of shocking results since october , and indeed examine the reasons behind that poor form			1
his success at making players better , making them worth large sums of money , helping them develop the talent and mentality to play for bigger clubs at a higher level , has proved his undoing			0
in the last 24 months @entity6 has lost players like @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
that lists includes two captains , well over 100 goals , and several promotions			2
@entity62 is the classic example : he produced his best - ever performance for @entity4 at @entity75 in a 5 - 1 win in february 2013			1
a few days later he joined @entity77 and @entity4 were relegated			1
now - @entity78 winger @entity62 celebrates scoring against @entity79 earlier in the season @entity64 scored a hat - trick as @entity4 completely outplayed @entity82 in a 6 - 0 win in august 2013			1
four days later , he refused to play for the club in a home defeat by @entity86 and demanded they let him leave			0
he eventually joined @entity88 the following january			0
@entity4 flopped in the play - offs			1
striker @entity90 had a brilliant first season at @entity4 bagging goals galore			1
last summer he was with the squad for the pre-season training camp in @entity97			0
fans were told he would n’t be leaving , the manager was under the same impression			0
yet hours before the start of the season he joined @entity103 for a record fee			0
@entity4 have never recovered and struggle to score			1
key summer signings @entity27 and @entity28 were brought in to provide and score goals – both have been injured for huge chunks of the season			0
in one of the rare games they played together , @entity4 absolutely destroyed @entity86 4 - 1 away from home to go second in the table			1
i was there that day and @entity4 could have scored 10			2
under @entity6 this season one of the club ’s talents from the academy @entity120 has blossomed , and proved many of his noisy doubters wrong			2
credit to the manager for sticking by his player when most of the fans thought he was a no - hoper			0
@entity6 has made mistakes : he can not spot a good goalkeeper ; he trusted the wrong man – @entity132 - to be captain of the club this season – he ’s not a leader and his game crumbled under the pressure ; he discarded a club legend @entity139 brutally and unnecessarily ; and his ability to change a game that ’s hurtling towards defeat has consistently been woeful			2
this is about how incredibly difficult it is to succeed at unfashionable clubs in the lower leagues			0
last season 's top scorer @entity68 left for @entity103 back in august @entity4 are a small club in the @entity149 with a loyal but tiny fanbase			2
if i get the job i 'll bring 24 - hour energy , expertise drawn from 40 years watching football and over 25 years reporting on it , picking the brains of some of the best and worst coaches and players in the game worldwide			2
i ’ll play old - style wingers , overlapping full backs , i ’ll ask my centre halves to be beasts , i ’ll ask my two central midfielders to be creative and destructive at the same time			0
hit the wingers as often as possible			0
get forward ! ! ! my policy will be to score more goals than the opposition : it might not always work , but when those players come off the pitch @entity170 , the fans will know they tried to entertain and went for the win			0
wives , partners and families of players and staff will be well looked after , with the aim of providing a network of friendship and support within the @entity4 family			2
@entity6 with @entity4 chairman @entity185 back in august 2012 my only foreseeable problem is winning the trust of the players , a sceptical bunch who are falling over themselves to apologise to @entity6 for getting him and his staff the sack			1
i ’ll do a deal with every single one of them individually , the terms of that deal will remain private , it wo n’t involve money , but it will involve an incredible amount of support and goodwill both ways			0
i ’ll expect them to run through brick walls for me - because they know i ’ll do the same for them			0
it ’s a tough place to succeed in the lower leagues			0
i get on with chairman @entity185 , which is a bonus , and i have a love / hate relationship with director of football @entity213 which i think will work out perfectly			0
he ’ll be pulling one way , i ’ll be pulling the other , but i know how to get round @entity213 , no problem			0
give me the job , because if you do n’t you ’ll never know how brilliant it could have been .			2
