@entity0 today challenged the @entity1 come clean about where the axe will fall , just 24 hours after the coalition ended			1
the @entity6 leader accused @entity7 and @entity8 of ' trying to pull the wool over your eyes ' by promising to protect the @entity12 without spelling out how he will pay for it			1
he said that only the @entity6 have promised to find the £ 8billion which @entity12 chiefs say will be needed by 2020 , and how the money will be found			1
@entity6 leader @entity0 , who tried his hand at making pancakes at a @entity21 site in @entity22 , took aim at chancellor @entity8 , who spent the day making making dough at a @entity25 in @entity26 @entity27 , the head of @entity28 , has warned that by the end of the decade the health service will need an extra £ 8billion - a - year			1
mr @entity0 boasted that he would ensure the @entity12 got the money , but he said @entity32 had not made that pledge and the @entity1 ' try to give the impression they have , but they have n't '			1
at an election campaign press conference at the @entity37 in central @entity38 he said : ' we know the @entity40 wo n't ask the wealthiest to pay a penny more so every spending commitment they make has to be met by deeper and deeper cuts elsewhere			0
' so , @entity8 , @entity47 - where will the axe fall ? soldiers , schools social workers ? the only people the @entity1 have said they will protect are their friends in big business and in big houses			1
' the conservatives are trying to pull the wool over your eyes by not telling you how they will give the @entity12 the resources it needs			1
' mr @entity8 was visiting @entity26 on the south coast as a row raged over spending cuts planned after the election the @entity1 have promised to give the @entity12 the money it needs , but the @entity6 say they have not been clear about where the money will come from mr @entity0 added : ' the dividing lines of this election are becoming clearer by the day			1
the @entity40 will cut too much , @entity32 will borrow too much			0
excessive cuts or excessive borrowing			0
it 's a dismal choice			0
' what you want is a balanced budget and stronger public services			0
that 's what the @entity6 offer			2
' the @entity6 were the first to publicly commit to providing ' in full ' the extra £ 8 billion a year the @entity12 boss says it needs by 2020			1
the party promises to repeat the £ 2 billion annual ' down payment ' announced by mr @entity8 each year to 2020 and add £ 1 billion from a tax squeeze on high earners and ending the @entity40 ' shares for rights ' policy			2
but the bulk of the extra is slated to come from increasing public spending in line with economic growth after eliminating the structural deficit in 2017 - 18			0
mr @entity0 used a press conference at the @entity37 to claim only the @entity6 have spelt out how to fund £ 8billion extra for the @entity12 mr @entity0 said the @entity6 would be ' pretty specific ' about exactly where the party 's preferred tax rises would hit by the time voters go to the polls the @entity6 today pledged an extra £ 2.5billion for mental health care to end ' decades of institutionalised discrimination ' in the @entity12			1
@entity0 said his party had proved they were serious about the issue by campaigning ' remorselessly ' in government for improved services , with some success			2
some £ 250 million over five years will be spent on services for pregnant women and mothers dealing with depression			2
this would include eight new mother and baby units providing inpatient care and 40 new community services helping new mothers adjust to life at home with a newborn			2
new waiting time standards will be introduced for people in crisis and for conditions like bipolar disorder so that those who are ill know how long they have to wait			0
the funding would also mean hundreds of thousands more people will get access to talking therapies for anxiety and depression			0
a commitment to boost funding for health , with a particular focus on mental health , will be on the front page of the @entity6 election manifesto , indicating it will be a key priority in any coalition talks after the @entity137			1
@entity138 , senior policy fellow at the @entity140 charity , said well - targeted extra funding for mental health could improve the quality of @entity12 care but questioned what other areas of health would lose cash as a result			1
however , this raises questions about what happens if the economy does not grow as rapidly as hoped			0
mr @entity0 said it was ' perfectly legitimate ' to base policy on current projections			2
' you can only operate on a set of assumptions			0
that 's what any economist does			0
since i ca n't tell you precisely in the future what is going to happen , i can tell you that we base our plans on the predictions that are given independently by the @entity169 , ' he said			0
asked what the plan would be if growth was slower , he said : ' well , what do i do if the world comes to an end next tuesday ? ' the greatest threat to ongoing growth in the @entity179 economy is that we do n't continue the balanced approach to fiscal consolidation and maintain the stability which has led to far greater growth than many predicted			0
' mr @entity0 went on : ' @entity185 , @entity7 , it 's time to come clean : will you or will you not give the @entity12 the £ 8 billion a year by 2020 that it needs and tell us how you plan to fund it ? ' the @entity6 have			1
if you care about the @entity12 as much as you claim to , you should too			2
' mr @entity0 said the @entity6 would be ' pretty specific ' about exactly where the party 's preferred tax rises would fall by the time voters go to the polls			1
it says £ 6 billion of the cost of balancing the books should come from increased tax - with the same sum found from a clampdown on tax dodgers , £ 12 billion in @entity201 cuts and around £ 3.5 from a squeeze on welfare			0
' i accept the challenge that we should show how that £ 6 billion is arrived at in additional taxes but i think we have already provided far more detail than any other party in the early stages of this election campaign , ' mr @entity0 said			2
' on taxes we will be pretty specific			0
