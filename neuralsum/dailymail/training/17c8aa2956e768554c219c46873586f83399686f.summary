@entity1 leader blamed @entity3 foreign policy and mass immigration for ‘ much of what has happened ' @entity6 risked sparking fresh outrage today after claiming @entity9 governments bore some ‘ culpability ’ for the @entity12 massacres			1
the @entity1 leader blamed @entity3 foreign policy and mass immigration for ‘ much of what has happened ’			1
his remarks come after he was attacked by @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 for claiming there was a ‘ fifth column ’ in @entity22			1
but speaking in the @entity23 , mr @entity6 brushed aside the claims he was ‘ seeking to divide ’ the country for political points			2
he told @entity27 : ‘ we need an honest admission that actually our political decisions have led to much of what has happened			2
‘ just think about foreign policy – from @entity33 through @entity34 , through @entity35 and even the attempt to arm the rebels in @entity38			0
‘ all of these we were told to make our streets safer , when in fact what we have done is stir up real resentments within the @entity44 community and it ’s had the very opposite effect			0
’ he added that ‘ mass immigration ’ had ‘ made it frankly impossible for many new communities to integrate ’			2
but mr @entity6 said : ‘ perhaps worst of all we have been guilty of weakness – lack of courage – a lack of assertion of who we are as people			0
‘ we ’ve turned a blind eye to many of our minority communities to practises that would not be tolerated in the rest of the population			0
‘ we ’ve allowed preachers of hate to go around saying things that are totally unacceptable			0
‘ unless we are prepared to admit our own culpability in much of what has happened we are not going to be able to find solutions			2
‘ we are going to have to be a lot braver and courageous in standing up for our @entity80 culture			0
’ members of the @entity23 observed a minute of silence in @entity83 for the victims of the @entity12 attack @entity1 @entity27 @entity87 ( left ) and @entity88 ( right place placards reading ' @entity89 ' on their desks mr @entity6 was last week criticised for ' inflaming ' tensions after the @entity92 insisted there can be no justification for the ' barbaric ' attack on the office of a @entity98 satirical magazine			1
mr @entity17 said it was wrong to use the attacks to ' make political remarks or arguments ' while mr @entity18 insisted : ' i do n't think @entity6 or anyone else should be seeking to divide us in this way			1
' @entity106 deputy pm @entity19 said : ' i am dismayed that @entity6 immediately thinks , on the back of the bloody murders that we saw on the streets of @entity12 yesterday , his first reflex is to make political points			2
' culture secretary @entity113 said there was ‘ no getting away ’ from the fact that the terrorists called themselves @entity44 he told @entity117 : ' if this does come down , as it appears to be the case , to two individuals who perverted the cause of @entity122 to their own bloody ends , let 's remember that the greatest antidote to the perversion of that great world religion are law - abiding @entity22 muslims themselves			1
' and to immediately ... imply that many , many @entity22 @entity44 - who i know feel fervently @entity22 but also are very proud of their @entity44 faith - are somehow part of the problem rather than part of the solution is firmly grabbing the wrong end of the stick			0
' but @entity22 ’s first elected @entity44 cabinet minister yesterday insisted it was ‘ lazy ’ to claim @entity122 had nothing to do with last week ’s terror attacks in @entity98			1
it comes after culture secretary @entity113 said there was ‘ no getting away ’ from the fact that the terrorists called themselves @entity44			2
mr @entity113 also called on @entity22 @entity44 to do more to tackle extremism – claiming they had a ‘ special burden ’ because so many of the attacks were carried out by fanatics who claim inspiration from @entity122			1
the former banker , who became the first @entity44 @entity153 mp after being elected in 2010 , attacked the ‘ barbaric ’ terrorists responsible for last week ’s atrocities			1
mr @entity113 said : ‘ the lazy answer from people out there is to say that this had got nothing whatsoever to do with @entity122 and @entity44 and that should be the end of that part of the debate			1
‘ that is lazy and that would be wrong			0
you ca n’t get away from the fact that these people are using @entity122 , they are taking a great religion , a peaceful religion of a billion people around the world , taking this religion and using it as their tool to carry out their horrible activities			0
’ mr @entity113 said because of this there was a ‘ special burden ’ on @entity44 to deal with @entity122 extremism			1
he said : ‘ all communities can do more to try and help and deal with terrorists , try and help track them down , but i think it is absolutely fair to say that there is a special burden on @entity44 communities , because whether we like it or not , these terrorists call themselves @entity44			0
‘ it is no good for people to say they are not @entity44 , that is what they call themselves			0
they do try to take what is a great peaceful religion and warp it for their own means			0
