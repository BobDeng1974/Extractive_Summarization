@entity0 has admitted struggling to find the perfect man to replace @entity2 at @entity3 , revealing he has only interviewed two candidates			1
@entity3 's co-chairman hoped to have a new manager installed by ' the early part of this week ' , to push at least three new signings through before the september 1 transfer deadline			1
@entity0 has only met @entity10 and @entity11 so far in his bid to replace @entity2 , who walked out on the eve of the season after rows over transfer policy			1
former @entity32 boss @entity10 pulled out of the running after initially being deemed second choice			1
caretaker manager @entity17 will take control of tuesday 's @entity37 trip to @entity38 , keen to solve defensive shortcomings that led to saturday 's 3 - 1 league defeat to @entity41			2
' you read all sorts of things about how many people we 've seen , ' @entity0 told the @entity47			2
' i have seen very few people , probably two , but spoken to other people about managers and doing background work and due diligence			0
' it 's not a revolving door of people coming in and having a chat			0
we have got a profile of a manager we think needs to carry the club forward based on what i 've experienced over the last four years			2
' finding the right person is n't easy			0
a lot of managers are in jobs and they 're not going to leave clubs early in the season , so it 's a difficult situation			0
' caretaker boss : @entity17 was placed in temporary charge of @entity3 following @entity2 ' shock exit not interested : @entity75 boss @entity74 is not keen on taking up the reins at @entity77 @entity75 boss @entity74 distanced himself from the @entity77 role at the weekend , while @entity79 confirmed his interest but said no one from @entity3 had made contact			1
former @entity84 and @entity85 boss @entity83 and @entity87 manager @entity86 remain squarely in the frame			2
temporary boss @entity17 conceded his biggest challenge now will be to piece together @entity3 's ' fragile ' confidence at @entity38			1
' we conceded twice from set - pieces and that 's something we have n't done in the past , and something you ca n't afford to do in the @entity97 , ' said @entity17			0
' you put a brave face on it of course you do , i 'm the one in charge at the moment			0
' we 've conceded two goals in three or four minutes , and that does knock the stuffing out of you , especially when you 're a bit fragile			0
