true lady : @entity1 was many things , including always well quiffed it ’s certainly not the kind of legacy many prime ministers can expect to have			1
since @entity1 ’s death earlier this month , scores of women have been paying tribute to her in a rather unexpected way – by adopting her hairstyle			1
one hairdresser , in @entity14 said he had been inundated by requests for ‘ @entity16 ’ , as the iconic style has become known			2
celebrity stylist @entity18 says his salon has been inundated with demands for the style and bookings are full			2
‘ i have not known anything like this for many years , ’ said mr @entity18			0
‘ we have now done the style for over 100 women , it is a surge			2
i experienced something similar when the @entity31 style became popular but that surge built slowly - this has come completely out of the blue			1
’ @entity36 ’s famous hairstyle originated in @entity38 ’s salon in @entity39 during the early 1970s			1
@entity41 ’s first modern look was adapted slightly as she aged but the cut never lost its unique power			1
‘ i decided to recreate the early look on one of my actress clients , ’ reveals mr @entity18			0
‘ it blossomed from there			0
the cut looked striking on her , other models and actresses that she knows were soon calling asking for the ‘ @entity36 ’			1
at first i found it amusing but now the domino effect has become serious , the demand is too much to cope with			0
’ ‘ i immediately fell in love with the cut , ’ said the actress			0
‘ it is the perfect mix of feminine style with a hint of masculine power			2
i think for a modern woman that is now an ideal balance			0
when my other model and actress friends saw it they were immediately intrigued			0
i have been turning a lot of heads			0
’ @entity1 ’s powerful image - steely and professional , yet always feminine - was a key part of her status			1
however , few women replicated the look during her time in office			0
now , in a time perhaps of greater equality , women have happily embraced the look			0
@entity81 tributes : the former prime minister 's famous hairstyle is now requested in salons as women want to copy ' the @entity36 ' the impact has now echoed into @entity87			1
@entity88 caused a stir at the weekend when she arrived at the @entity90 sporting a ‘ power statement ’ style			2
her famous blonde hair was swept tightly to her head , adopting the same lines as the ‘ @entity36 ’			1
her look at the @entity97 hosted event made headlines across the world			0
@entity102 - born @entity101 , 37 , a digital consultant , said she felt the look reflected a modern attitude			0
‘ this is a strong style and gives me authority , ’ she said			2
‘ when i walk out the door i feel a few inches taller , it gives me power without sacrificing any of my femininity			0
’ ‘ we ’ve done over seventy of the styles since the news broke of @entity1 ’s death , ’ reveals @entity18			1
this lady is not for turning ! from her days running the country to her later years , @entity1 's hairstyle never changed ‘ it is a steady flow at the moment			1
what i like is that women are using it to give their lives and general attitudes a boost , many of them tell me that they step out of the chair with more confidence			0
it started with younger girls adopting the style - now they have started sending their mums in ! what i find interesting is that every women will have a different image of @entity36 in their mind depending on their age			1
’ achieving the look is initially a complicated process			0
‘ @entity1 paid a surprising amount of attention to her style , ’ says @entity18			1
@entity143 , a 32 - year - old mum of two , said she appreciated the style ’s practicality			2
‘ she was a busy lady , and so am i. once the cut is done , the ‘ @entity36 ’ is quick and easy to knock into place and i can run out the door			1
’ celebrity clients of the salon range from @entity152 to the ‘ made in @entity14 ’ stars ; we may be seeing ‘ @entity36 ’ on our screens soon			1
‘ i never reveal client details and i will not say who has expressed an interest , ’ says @entity18			0
‘ but , yes , i think it is safe to say that more star names are set to take this style back onto the world stage			2
