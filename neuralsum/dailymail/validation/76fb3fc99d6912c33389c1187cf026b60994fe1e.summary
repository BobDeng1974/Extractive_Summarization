@entity162 , @entity46 's marketing manager , said : ' the point of difference between this campaign and the @entity123 or the # nomakeupselfie , is that the whole idea centres around kids			0

something else that makes it unique is that it was born in @entity177 and it uses an @entity177 text donation service			0
to be involved , people simply need to text ' @entity9 ' to 0476 000 222 to donate			2
@entity46 has been performing a puppet show in schools across the country to encourage students to support their peers who are suffering or recovering from cancer all funds donated to the campaign will help fund @entity46 ’s touring puppet show for schools			1
these shows teach pupils how to be supportive and understanding of kids living with cancer			0
the performance is incredibly effective in preventing and tackling teasing , staring and name - calling when a child returns to school post-treatment			0
a urine infection led to the discovery of a tumour in @entity9 's left kidney			2
she was quickly diagnosed with stage one cancer and was signed up for surgery to remove the organ			2
according to @entity207 from the cancer charity @entity46 , @entity9 is one of 10,000 children across @entity177 who are currently newly diagnosed , under treatment or in remission from cancer treatment			1
the show discourages bullying and expels myths that children hold about cancer , including that it is contagious , encouraging them to support and include kids with mr @entity207 told @entity68 that after all the emotional and physical hardships endured by the children throughout their treatment , just as things are starting to look up , one of the most common problems they encounter is bullying			2
' we 've heard about everything from pointing and staring and : ' mummy , why does she looks so different ? ' to exclusion and isolation , ' mr @entity207 said			0
' exclusion is one of the more common ones , kids are often left out because other kids think that they can catch cancer and it 's contagious			0
' we hear it a lot and there was one incident of name calling recently where we had a mum ringing us up and saying her daughter was being called ' baldie ' and some of the kids were taking off her beanie and throwing it and playing catch with it '			0
@entity46 is determined to change this mentality and teach children that there is no need to cover up the effects of their cancer treatment , while educating their peers about how to be supportive and understanding of kids living with cancer			0
the charity has been roaming the country with their educational puppet show on the request of parents and teachers , to expel the myths around cancer			0
@entity207 , a spokesperson for the cancer charity , said that by the end of the show , the kids are all cheering for the bald puppet character to take off her hat former @entity276 editor @entity157 posted a photo on @entity278 encouraging people to take part in the @entity46 campaign their show has been viewed by over 230,000 children in the last year and relies on public support to continue running			1
it involves a bald cancer - patient puppet who tries to decide if she should take off her hat - just like little @entity9			1
' by the end of the show the kids are all cheering for her to take off her hat , ' mr @entity207 explains			0
' once our puppet show had come to one school , we heard of a girl who went back to her class and quietly removed her hat and she did n't wear it from then on			0
once we teach the students about it , that child becomes a sort of hero for all they 've been through and they have other children falling over themselves to be their friend			0
' after mrs @entity9 asked @entity46 to come to her daughter 's school to perform their puppet show , she said there was an instant change in attitude			2
now , whilst her hair is still much shorter than it once was , @entity9 - who is now in remission - often tells her mother how much she 's looking forward to having long hair again .			1

@entity9 was diagnosed with stage one cancer at five years old
she underwent five months of chemotherapy and had her kidney removed
the six year old and her three - year - old sister spent entire days with a pair of pants or tights on their heads , pretending it was their long hair

money raised goes toward puppet shows , held at schools to help children learn how to be considerate of *classmates* returning after cancer
