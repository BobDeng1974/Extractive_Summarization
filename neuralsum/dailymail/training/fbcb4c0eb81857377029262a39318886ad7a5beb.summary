by @entity0 @entity1 has said that she will ' absolutely ' endorse @entity2 ' if she runs ' for president in 2016			0
the two women from similarly powerful @entity6 clans have had a turbulent history in the past , but in a new interview , the american ambassador to @entity9 gave a measured hint of an endorsement			0
' i know it sounds like a cliché , but two years is a really long time in politics			1
i ’m sure she ’s looking forward to being a grandmother , i know she ’s got to decide soon			0
so , so you know i hope so , ' @entity1 said in an interview with @entity21			0
serious support : @entity1 and @entity2 , seen here in 2000 when @entity24 was running for @entity25 , have been allies for years making it even more of a shock when @entity1 opted to support @entity29 over @entity24 in 2008 payback : president @entity29 appointed @entity1 ( seen together in @entity9 on thursday ) as the new @entity32 ambassador to @entity9 in a move that many saw as a ' thank you ' for her critical support in his 2008 race against @entity2 @entity1 's endorsement can be a powerful thing , and though it was assumed that she would lend her name to her longtime ally @entity24 during the 2008 presidential race , she actually turned the tide by coming out in support of @entity29 in january of that year			1
many considered @entity1 's endorsement , as well as that of her now - deceased uncle senator @entity47 , of @entity29 as the point in which the @entity6 base began to switch over from the former first lady 's camp to that of the one - term senator from @entity54			1
the drama between @entity24 and @entity1 was not fully put to bed until nearly a year later , after @entity29 was elected and he had selected @entity24 as his secretary of state			1
@entity1 expressed an interest in being nominated to take over for @entity24 , who was one of the @entity60 senators at the time			2
keeping her options open : @entity1 said that she would ' absolutely ' support @entity24 ( seen on wednesday at a talk in @entity64 ) in a 2016 race but echoed @entity24 's own assertions that she has not yet made up her mind @entity24 's loyal band of supporters promptly attacked @entity1 , calling her out for barely donating to political causes and in some cases ' forgetting ' to even vote			1
@entity24 was the one to call off the attack dogs , and @entity73 reported at the time that she made sure that ' supporters who said anything critical were rebuked '			2
the wording of @entity1 ’s ‘ endorsement ’ of @entity24 shows some degree of hesitation			2
it may well be because @entity24 has clearly not made a formal announcement of her intentions of running in 2016 - even though polls have her leaps and bounds ahead of any other @entity6 candidate , including vice president @entity86			1
another more long - shot theory , proposed by the @entity88 shortly after @entity1 was named as the new ambassador to @entity9 , is that @entity1 herself plans to run for the @entity91 in 2016 and fulfil her family destiny by taking over where her father ’s legacy was cut short			0
picking sides : the @entity6 primary race effectively switched from having @entity2 in the lead to then - one - term senator @entity29 once @entity1 chose him over her ‘ could @entity2 be shoved from the limelight twice by @entity1 ? while that might sound premature , @entity1 delivered the argument for charisma and vision over experience when she and her uncle dealt @entity24 the first of many blows in the 2008 campaign , ’ reporter @entity98 wrote in the @entity88			1
in her initial op - ed of support of @entity29 in 2008 , @entity1 said that he would be ' a president like my father ' and noted the importance of persona and personality			1
' it is n’t that the other candidates are not experienced or knowledgeable			0
but this year , that may not be enough , ' she said in a 2008 editorial in the @entity119			0
party over person : the @entity122 and @entity123 are arguably the two most powerful @entity6 families in @entity32 politics ( @entity1 , her husband @entity126 and her uncle @entity47 seen greeting the then - president and first lady in 1997 ) ‘ sometimes it takes a while to recognize that someone has a special ability to get us to believe in ourselves , to tie that belief to our highest ideals and imagine that together we can do great things			2
in those rare moments , when such a person comes along , we need to put aside our plans and reach for what we know is possible			0
’ during the interview that was released thursday , which coincided with the president 's visit to @entity9 , @entity1 made it clear that she thinks he has held up his end of the bargain - even if many other @entity6 are trying to distance themselves due to his low poll numbers			1
' i think he ’s been a great president			0
and i think that this rebalanced @entity153 is a really good example of somebody who ’s taking the long view , advancing the @entity32 interest , ' she said to @entity21 .			0

@entity1 has said she will support @entity24 even though she opted for her rival - then - senator @entity29 - in the 2008 presidential race
even @entity1 hedged her hint of a @entity24 endorsement by saying ' two years is a really long time in politics ' so she may not end up running
the @entity1 2008 endorsement was *largely* seen as the reason why @entity29 won the @entity6 nomination
@entity1 then tried to run for the @entity25 seat @entity24 left when she was chosen as secretary of state but @entity24 's supporters attacked her
@entity24 was the one to call off their attacks
