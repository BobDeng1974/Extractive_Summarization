by @entity0 published : 16:10 est , 19 may 2012 updated : 16:10 est , 19 may 2012 women over 40 will be entitled to free fertility treatment on the @entity3 for the first time under @entity6 guidelines to be published this week			1
the @entity3 is set to extend the controversial upper age limit for @entity8 by three years to 42 , following advice that suggests many women in their late 30s and early 40s could conceive after treatment			1
the current guidance is that the @entity3 should not provide ivf to women over the age of 39			1
government guidelines : women over 40 will be entitled to free fertility treatment on the @entity3 for the first time now 8,000 more women a year could have the chance to become mothers without having to pay £ 5,000 to private clinics			1
fertility experts said the recommendations may encourage more women to delay having babies until middle age , which puts both mother and child at risk			2
children born to women over 40 are more likely to have abnormalities , and mothers are more likely to have problems during labour			0
nearly half of all pregnancies in women aged 40 to 42 result in miscarriage			2
however , the review has come because of concerns in the @entity3 that the existing age limit could leave clinics open to legal challenges under new age - discrimination laws			1
the update , by @entity6 rationing watchdog the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) , is also expected to make it easier for couples hoping to start a family to access fertility treatment			0
at the moment , couples must have been trying unsuccessfully for a baby for three years before being considered for @entity3 treatment			1
but the recommendations , due to be published on tuesday , will allow couples access to free @entity8 after only two years			1
a senior source said : ‘ the upper age limit for @entity8 on the @entity3 is to be increased to 42 and will grant those women one single cycle of @entity8			1
‘ there will also be earlier access to treatment			0
instead of waiting for three years , couples will now get through to @entity8 clinics after unsuccessfully trying for a baby for two years			2
’ dr @entity69 , former emeritus professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at @entity72 and the @entity73 , said the recommendations sent out ‘ the wrong message ’ and added : ‘ part of this is about taking equality to the extreme to protect those who feel sensitive about accusations of ageism , and that ’s a nonsense			0
‘ @entity83 should n’t use this as an excuse to continue to delay looking for mr @entity86 , and economically speaking the @entity3 ca n’t afford it			0
’ @entity8 expert @entity88 , medical director of @entity89 , said : ‘ in biological terms , 35 is actually too late to start trying for a family			2
‘ what ’s important is for society to recognise that couples should start families in their late 20s or early 30s			2
’ more than 46,000 women had @entity8 in 2010 and about 40 per cent were @entity3 patients			1
nearly 8,000 were aged between 40 and 42 and would have been treated in the private sector , where clinics set age limits higher than the @entity3			1
@entity48 decided to review the guidance to make sure it fully complied with the @entity103 , passed in 2010			0
the recommendations are in draft form and will go through a period of consultation until july			0
the final guidance will not be mandatory and individual @entity3 trusts can decide not to implement it			0
a @entity48 spokesman said : ‘ we can not comment on speculation on the draft update			0
any new recommendations will have been developed according to new evidence published since 2004			0
