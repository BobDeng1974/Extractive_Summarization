the breakthrough into the huge underground space at @entity8 by the machine named @entity10 marked the completion of 75 per cent of the tunnelling work on the scheme , which will be finished in 2018			1
work is taking place more than 100ft down to create a new platform and passenger tunnels for a new @entity1 station			0
more than 19 miles of tunnelling have now been completed , with more than 2.5 million tonnes of earth removed and three of the eight boring machines having ' retired '			2
running from @entity24 in @entity25 in the west to as far east as @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity1 will pass through 40 stations and reduce @entity31 journey times			1
