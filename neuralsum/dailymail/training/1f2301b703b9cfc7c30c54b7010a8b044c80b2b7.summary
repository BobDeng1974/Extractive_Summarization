by @entity0 published : 22:39 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 04:27 est , 1 august 2013 @entity1 is threatening to kick @entity2 out of the game for life unless the @entity6 star agrees not to fight a lengthy suspension for his role in the sport 's latest drug scandal , according to a person familiar with the discussions			1
the person spoke to @entity0 on wednesday on condition of anonymity because no statements were authorized			0
whether commissioner @entity16 would actually issue a lifetime suspension was unclear and a permanent ban could be shortened by arbitrator @entity19 to about 200 games , the person said			1
@entity21 : @entity2 faces the possibility of a lifetime ban from baseball as he continues to fight doping allegations the number of players likely to be disciplined stood at 14 wednesday			1
front and center is @entity2 , baseball 's highest - paid player and the most prominent one linked in media reports over the past seven months to @entity32 , a closed @entity34 anti-aging clinic that allegedly distributed banned performance - enhancing drugs			1
the @entity6 expected @entity2 to be accused of recruiting other athletes for the clinic , attempting to obstruct @entity1 's investigation , and not being truthful with @entity1 in the past			1
@entity1 has considered suspending him for violations of its labor contract and drug agreement			1
even if he is banned from baseball , there is precedent for a shortened penalty : when pitcher @entity48 was given a lifetime ban in 1992 in his seventh suspension for drug or alcohol use , an arbitrator reduced the penalty to 119 days			1
stain on the game : @entity1 says the players above are all tied to a @entity34 - based @entity57 clinic a three - time mvp , @entity2 acknowledged four years ago that he used performance - enhancing substances while with @entity60 from 2001 - 03 but repeatedly has denied using them since			1
he 's been sidelined all season since hip surgery in january and then a quadriceps strain during a minor league rehabilitation assignment in july			0
the @entity6 say he 'll start another rehab friday - @entity68 @entity67 appeared to be the likely destination			2
' hopefully @entity2 will be back shortly thereafter , ' @entity6 general manager @entity70 said			1
@entity2 did n't stop to talk with reporters after his workout wednesday at the team 's minor league complex in @entity75 , @entity34 at first , @entity1 and the union thought talks on the @entity32 probe could be completed by friday , but negotiations to avoid grievances are likely to push back announcements until at least saturday or sunday			1
the @entity82 : @entity1 commissioner @entity16 says he will seek a lifetime ban against @entity2 if he continues to fight his suspension others accused in media reports of receiving performance - enhancing drugs from @entity32 include a trio of 2013 all - stars : @entity60 outfielder @entity91 , @entity93 shortstop @entity92 and @entity95 shortstop @entity94			1
most of the players face 50 - game bans as first offenders			1
both sides felt urgency to complete the process because by the middle of next week , teams will have fewer than 50 games left			2
and that would force players to complete suspensions during the playoffs or at the start of next season			2
@entity95 general manager @entity112 protected against a possible suspension of @entity94 by acquiring slick - fielding infielder @entity114 from @entity115 in a three - team trade tuesday night			2
' if it were a 15 - day thing , like a typical injury , i think we could have comfortably dealt with it with the players we already have , ' @entity112 said wednesday			2
' but when you start to talk about 50 days and a possible playoff run , we feel better going ahead with @entity114			0
' circus : the doping allegations have created a media circus around @entity2 that might be distracting - if he were actually playing while @entity1 told the union which players it intends to suspend , it has n't issued formal notices of discipline			1
because of that , the countdown has n't started under baseball 's @entity135 , which says the suspensions are effective on the third business day after the notice is issued			2
the sides also have n't decided whether suspensions for first - time offenders who challenge the penalty can be announced before an arbitration decision			2
if some stars knew their seasons were about to be cut short , they were n't letting on wednesday , at least publicly			2
' i ca n't talk about nothing right now			0
just wait for the news , ' @entity92 said wednesday before playing against @entity151			0
@entity94 thinks he should n't be on the list of players linked to @entity32			1
' it 's wrong , ' he said			0
' but whatever happens , i need to fight and try to move on			0
' @entity156 : @entity156 was banned from baseball for life after it was revealed he gambled on games while manager of the @entity162 @entity164 outfielder @entity163 , @entity166 pitcher @entity165 and @entity93 catcher @entity167 were all suspended for 50 games last year for positive tests for elevated testosterone			0
@entity1 informed the union they wo n't receive additional discipline for that violation , two people familiar with the probe said			1
they also spoke on condition of anonymity because no statements were authorized			0
' nothing 's been told to me , ' @entity163 said			0
' i served my suspension last year , but @entity1 has never told me that it 's ok now			1
i 'm seeing it in the press , but i do n't know			0
' @entity60 was unable to find a replacement bat to fill a void a suspension of @entity91 would create			0
' i do n't think anybody 's comfortable losing a significant part of your club , but it 's out of our control , ' @entity188 general manager @entity187 said			0
' we explored some deal like that			0
they just did n't come to a head			0
it was n't for lack of interest or lack of effort			0
it was more lack of supply and lack of fit , really			0

@entity2 is one of nine players @entity1 has linked to @entity34 - based @entity57 distribution ring called @entity32
@entity1 commissioner @entity16 says @entity2 can avoid a lifetime ban if he does n't fight an expected suspension
any lifetime ban likely could be lessened to 200 games by arbitrator @entity19
