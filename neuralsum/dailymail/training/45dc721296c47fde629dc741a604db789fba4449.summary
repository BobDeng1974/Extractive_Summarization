the hunt to find the exact location of the lost @entity2 on comet @entity3 has so far struggled to locate the fridge - sized probe			1
images sent back by the @entity8 spacecraft orbiting the comet have not yet revealed any clues as to where @entity2 may have fallen - and now experts believe the lander may be shrouded in dust			1
it is thought the probe settled in a ditch beneath a cliff after bouncing more than half a mile from its original landing site			0
however , further attempts to find the lander at the foot of the cliff have failed to find the probe without sufficient sunlight on its solar panels , the probe 's batteries went flat after just 60 hours and scientists lost contact with it			1
while also gathering data for other parts of the mission , the mothership @entity8 has also been taking photographs of the approximate landing site			0
the @entity8 probe , which was carrying @entity2 , launched into space in 2004 , using the gravity of @entity47 and @entity48 to slingshot its way towards comet @entity3			2
it chased comet @entity51 â€“ @entity52 through space for more than ten years , and entered orbit in august 2014			0
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , the probe then successfully released the @entity2 lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 november 2014 , travelling at 1 metre ( 40 inches ) per second relative to the comet			2
but when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet			0
this resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) above the comet before again landing on the surface			0
it then bounced again , but to a much lower altitude			0
scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on @entity47 - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid , not a comet			0
scientists have been poring over each image in the hope of detecting any bright spots that might be sunlight catching @entity2 's reflective surface			2
however , it is feared that the probe is entirely obscured by the overhanging cliff face it managed to photograph before running out of power			1
dust thrown up by the landing and movement of the comet itself could also have compounded the problem by falling back to the surface and shrouding the lander			1
early results have shown that the icy surface of the comet is covered in a layer of dust around 3.9 - inches to 7.8 - inches ( 10 to 20cm ) thick			2
indeed , research teams behind the @entity8 mission are preparing to publish a scientific paper on the dust later this month			0
it is expected to provide new information on the way dust billows off the surface of the comet			0
rather than streaming off the comet into space in a uniform way , it instead comes from a few hotspots that act like dust geysers			0
while some of this dust is scraped away to form the comet 's tail , some also is pulled back to the comet 's surface by gravity			1
despite this , researchers at the @entity127 hope that @entity2 will come back to life and reveal its location as the comet moves closer to the sun. the comet is currently 244 million miles ( 392 million km ) from the sun and is due to reach its closest point to the sun in august this year			1
by then , there might be enough sunlight hitting @entity2 's solar panels to spark it back into life			1
before its batteries ran out , @entity2 managed to send back this image of a cliff face that is shading the lander the @entity8 spacecraft is now orbiting comet @entity146 ( left ) at an altitude of 30km and has sent back a range of images revealed the landscape allowing scientists to recreate what it would look like to the human eye ( right ) professor @entity156 , a planetary scientist at @entity157 who is the chair of the @entity127 's @entity159 and is one of the scientists working on the @entity8 mission , said : ' the lighting conditions on the comet will only change gradually as it moves closer to the sun. ' if @entity2 is indeed under a cliff as we suspect , then the lighting conditions will have to be right before we can see it			1
' dust settling on the lander could not only make it harder to spot but may also pose a problem for powering @entity2 back up as it gets closer to the sun by stopping the solar panels from working properly			1
' this blurry image captures the moment @entity2 bounced from the comet 's surface after failing to anchor itself @entity8 captured a mothership 's view of @entity2 as it descended to the surface of @entity181 on 12 november 2014 before losing contact with the probe after it bounced twice on the surface @entity2 touched down on @entity185 on 12 november , but rather than landing softly , the failure of its harpoons and thrusters saw it bounce twice - first to a height of 0.62 miles ( 1km ) and then 65ft ( 20 metres ) - before finally coming to rest			1
blurry images captured the the spacecraft movement through the air			0
scientists described the comet 's surface as being more like a trampoline , causing the probe to rebound so far			1
images from @entity8 have been used to construct this model of how @entity2 is thought to have finally landed astronomer @entity199 cropped and tilted this image , taken by @entity8 and released by the @entity127 , to show what comet @entity146 's dramatic landscape would look like when standing on its surface this image is a composite of four pictures taken by the @entity8 probe 12 miles above the surface before its batteries finally ran out , @entity2 managed to send back data on the few experiments it was able to conduct along with some images			1
among the discoveries to have been released so far is that the comet 's surface appears to be made of a very hard ' sintered ' ice			1
researchers also revealed that they had found organic molecules - the basic building blocks of life			0
from several miles above the comet , @entity8 has also continued to provide a constant stream of images and data since it arrived			2
images taken with @entity8 's @entity228 camera revealed an array of ' dinosaur egg ' shaped boulders and blocks on the surface that are thought to be the remains of the original icy material that formed the comet 4.5 billion years ago			2
large stretches of sand dunes and boulder fields have also been seen by @entity8 's cameras			0
they have provided evidence that @entity146 , which is just 2.4 miles ( 4km ) across , is surprisingly strong - able to shape depressions and arrange boulders			0
this graphic shows how @entity2 bounced twice after it failed to anchor itself to the surface of the comet			2

scientists have been searching images taken by @entity8 for signs of @entity2
the fridge - sized lander is thought to be obscured by an overhanging cliff
dust falling back to the comet 's surface may also have covered the probe
this could limit the amount of light lander is able to get on its solar panels
researchers believe the lander could still power back up and reveal its location when it gets more light as the comet gets closer to the sun
