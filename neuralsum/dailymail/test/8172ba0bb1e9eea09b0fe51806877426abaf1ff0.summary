when @entity1 announced he was leaving @entity2 last week it was amid rumours that he was set to launch a solo career			1
and the speculation has not abated since a producer known as naughty boy - real name @entity8 - posted a clip ( which has now been removed ) , of what was thought to have been the 22 - year - old 's first single			1
indeed , the track , entitled i wo n't mind , sent both @entity2 fans and one of @entity1 's former band mates into turmoil			1
while it sounds cryptic , the video is thought to reference the collaboration between the two and angered @entity2 who are still disappointed at @entity1 's departure from the group			1
it also enraged @entity1 's former bandmate @entity37			1
@entity37 tweeted at the producer : ' @entity40 you 're so inconsiderate pal , seriously how f * * * * * * old are you ? grow up ! # masterofallwisdom ' @entity8 believed that @entity42 was angered by an earlier tweet as he replied : ‘ @ @entity44 calm down			2
was talkin bout @entity45 cuz he did n't let someone through on @entity48			0
look @ the date of the tweet			0
’ naughty boy was pictured with @entity52 , the boss of @entity1 's record label @entity53 , earlier this year at the @entity55 dinner he then wrote : ‘ when ur gettin hate for some thing u did n't do , a bit of love can go a long way , that 's why i retweeted , time will tell the real story guys			1
' @entity42 was quick to point out exactly why he was angered as he responded : ‘ @ naughtyboymusic i was talking about the video you tweeted			0
clearly trying to wind the fans up ! well you succeeded anyway			0
' onlookers can only speculate that @entity8 's reference to something he ' did n't do ' is linked to the fact that he is being blamed for @entity1 leaving the band			1
when he teased the single off what is thought to be @entity1 's forthcoming solo album due out in 2016 on @entity53 , he said : ' let the music do the talking guys			1
thank us later , ' along with a @entity82 link to i wo n't mind			0
naughty boy is well connected in the music industry , pictured here at an event in 2014 with @entity87 ( left ) and @entity88 ( center ) naughty boy attends the @entity91 in 2014 with @entity92 who he has previously worked with ' there is nothing but love for what was left behind			1
that 's why we do n't mind # 2016 # zaughty # zindabad , ' he added			0
the flurry of outrage , accusations and upset all follow an upsetting week for @entity2 's devoted fans after @entity1 initially bowed out of the band 's tour and then left the group			2
he confirmed his exit in a statement which read : ' my life with one direction has been more than i could ever have imagined			0
' but , after five years , i feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band			0
i 'd like to apologise to the fans if i 've let anyone down , but i have to do what feels right			0
' whether @entity1 will be @entity8 's newest collaborator remains to be seen , but he certainly wo n't be the biggest name he 's worked with			1
so far he 's worked with @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity92 and @entity122 and he even helped to produce @entity124 's hit song @entity125			1
naughty boy chats to @entity127 , his career was started thanks to a grant from @entity131 he also wrote a song for one direction in 2014 with the help of @entity135 and @entity1 himself			1
at the time @entity8 explained the collaboration telling the mirror : ' we [ he and @entity1 ] met at the @entity140 , we both have a @entity142 background and we just got on straight away			2
' in this business it 's hard to make new friends , but we spend a lot of time together just chilling out , making music			2
' in 2013 he achieved musical success in his own right with @entity151 - a collaboration with @entity153 - which became the year 's fastest selling single			2
the track won both @entity156 and @entity157 at the @entity158 that year			0
but the producer came from humble beginnings and he started @entity161 while working for @entity162			0
prior to this he had studied business and marketing at @entity166 but left the course after only one term			0
@entity8 was able to buy his recording equipment after going on @entity170 and winning £ 44,000 it was ten years ago in 2005 when @entity8 was 20 that he took part on the reality gameshow indeed , it was n't until 2005 when he began to be able to build the business , thanks to a £ 5,000 grant from the @entity131			1
and @entity8 proved to be a lucky boy when , in the same year , he took part on the hit @entity181 show @entity170 and won £ 44,000 which allowed him to buy all of his studio equipment			1
however , despite having collaborated with big artists , it 's his work with @entity1 that may well turn out to be the most controversial			2
especially given the circumstances in which the 22 - year - old left @entity2			1
in a statement released last week @entity1 revealed that he wanted out of the band so that he could live ' a normal life , ' with many speculating that he could n't handle the level of fame the boy had achieved			0
whilst he may not be instantly recognisable @entity8 is very well connected , here his is pictured with @entity92 ( left ) and @entity194 ( right ) however , it was just a couple of days before the singer was pictured in a @entity199 studio with @entity8 , leading to speculation that the pair had already begun work on his solo album			0
the release of i wo n't mind may also put a spanner in the works for both @entity1 and @entity2 as far as their previous work commitments are concerned			0
it has been reported that in 2013 the boys signed a deal to make two more albums and a greatest hits compilation , however , by leaving the band @entity1 may well have forfeited this deal			2
but it does n't look as if @entity1 's boss @entity53 head honcho @entity52 , is too unhappy about the situation			1
it 's already been confirmed that when the @entity223 born singer does release his own music it will be on the @entity53 label			0
and @entity8 has previously revealed his closeness to the music mogul , not only being pictured with him at events , but mentioning in a previous interview that the pair are in text contact .			2
