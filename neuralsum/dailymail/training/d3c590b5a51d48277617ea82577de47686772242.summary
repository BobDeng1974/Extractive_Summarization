@entity2 military efforts to construct treatment facilities , set up more labs , conduct testing and training in @entity3 to deal with the @entity10 crisis are expected to cost $ 750 million over six months , the army general who commands @entity2 troops in @entity3 said on tuesday			1
general @entity11 said the @entity2 has been asked to set up four more testing labs , in addition to the three already there			1

the troops do not come in contact with the actual sick patients , but handle only the samples			0
some 4,000 military personnel are being deployed to @entity3 to help deal with the crisis commander of @entity38 general @entity11 speaks during a news briefing on the @entity41 's response on @entity10 today asked whether the military response to the crises has been slow , @entity11 said one of the challenges has been the ability of @entity47 to absorb the influx of people and infrastructure changes			1
' their whole nation is overwhelmed			0
their health facilities are overwhelmed , ' said @entity11 , head of @entity38			2
' their infrastructure and their capacity to house people , to feed people and all that is limited			0
so it 's all going to have to come in , in a very , very carefully orchestrated — based on the demand out at the front			0
' he added that @entity2 officials ' do n't want to overwhelm them and press things in there that can not — they ca n't absorb at all			2
' the @entity2 has authorized the deployment of up to 4,000 @entity2 forces to help deal with the crisis , and @entity11 said he does n't expect to need more than that , but did n't rule out expanding the effort			1
he also said he is confident that the troops will be sufficiently trained and equipped with protective garments in order to avoid getting infected			2
the troops are providing logistics , training , diagnostic labs and engineering support as part of a broader @entity2 effort			1
in particular , he said the troops staffing the labs are highly trained in biological , chemical and nuclear warfare and will be monitored and tested continually			1

women suspected to be infected by @entity10 are pictured in a hospital , on october 6 in @entity98 , @entity33			0
@entity10 may only be present in a few @entity3 nations , but fears over the crippling outbreak are infecting economies across the continent and may put its envy - inducing growth prospects at risk he said the @entity2 has enough protective equipment for the troops being sent in			1
forces from the @entity110 at @entity111 , @entity112 , are preparing to go to @entity3			0

' when you go in one of these @entity10 treatment units , you 're going to wash your hands and feet multiple times			0
you 're going to get your temperature taken in and out			0
and then there is a checklist of things to ask each personnel based on the — the virus or any other sickness , quite frankly , that could be coming up , ' @entity11 said			2
the military expects to finish the construction of 17 treatment centers by mid-november , but @entity11 said troops could be in the region for as long as a year , based on how long it takes for the transmission of the virus to begin to decline			1
' we 're going to stay as long as we 're needed , but not longer than we 're needed , ' he said			0
@entity10 has claimed close to 3,500 lives in @entity3 since the outbreak began last year			1

he says the international community has not been as aggressive as it needs to be to help contain what he 's calling a top national security issue for the @entity2			0
@entity144 says he intends to put pressure on other foreign heads of state to ' make sure that they are doing everything that they can to join us in this effort '			0
he said the chances for an @entity10 outbreak in the @entity2 are low , but he says his administration is working on additional screening protocols for international airline passengers both in the @entity2 and overseas			2
@entity2 officials have refused to close @entity2 borders to travelers from @entity47 , @entity33 and @entity139 - the three countries where @entity10 continues to spread like wildfire			1
on friday , @entity170 director @entity169 said closing to borders to @entity171 would only make the @entity10 outbreak worse by cutting off the supply of aide and strangling the local economies			0
no @entity2 airlines fly to @entity47 , @entity33 or @entity139 , but @entity177 and other @entity179 carriers are still offering service from the @entity3 capitals .			2
