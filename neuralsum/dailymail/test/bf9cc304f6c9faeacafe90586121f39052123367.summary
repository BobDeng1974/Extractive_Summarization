harrowing images reveal one of west - @entity3 's vast electronic graveyards where ' millions of tonnes ' of discarded appliances from all over the world - including the @entity7 - are being dumped every year			1
thousands of broken televisions , computers , microwaves and refrigerators are being illegally exported to @entity3 countries and dumped gigantic landfills like @entity15 in @entity16 because it costs less than recycling them in their countries of origin , campaigners claim			1
41 million tonnes of ' e-waste ' worth over £ 34billion were discarded globally in 2014 , according to a shocking report by @entity24 who claim only 6 million tonnes of that was recycled properly			1
that dwarfs the 1.9 million tonnes produced by the whole of @entity3 and yet the continent 's western nations have become a dumping ground for the world 's defunct products			1
some of the appliances even leak toxic elements such as lead and mercury which harms the environment and the young men who trawl through the broken goods hoping to find something worth selling			1
the shocking images taken by e-waste campaigners qamp reveal how countless household appliances have contaminated what was once the ' pastoral landscape ' of @entity15 in @entity34			1
' developed countries export millions of tonnes of electronic waste annually into developing countries such as @entity16 , ' the group based in the country claims on its website			1
photographs show young boys trawling through the western world 's scraps , dismantling old stereos and burning components to recover scrap metal - which they will sell for small amounts of money			2
transporting broken or expired electronics to @entity3 is illegal but brokers exploit a loophole by fraudulently labelling the items as reusable , according to the @entity67 who believes @entity3 is becoming ' a graveyard for e-waste '			2
when massive containers arrive in @entity16 and @entity135 , they are trucked to remote locations where the locals can buy the products directly without testing them to later sell in markets , dr @entity132 told @entity140 he believes legal shipments can help close the digital divide between @entity3 and the west but said : ' if it turns out that this equipment arriving in @entity3 is no longer of use , there is no longer a market existing or that they are getting real waste … then we are having a real issue			1
' aid : @entity24 believes legal shipments of electronic appliances can help people in @entity3 who burn components ( pictured ) to extract scrap metal which they can sell broken : but the head of the organisation dr @entity132 told @entity140 that most of the material being shipped to @entity3 ' is nothing more than junk ' useless : 1.8 million tonnes of ' large equipment ' including washing machines ( pictured in @entity15 ) , clothes dryers , dishwashers and electric stoves was discarded world wide in 2014 profit : locals in @entity16 's capital @entity34 intercept trucks carrying the discarded products and buy the products without testing them - to later sell them in the city 's market ( pictured ) @entity178 : @entity3 nations like @entity16 are inundated with the world 's waste because the continent 's eastern and southern countries are implementing measures to prevent the dumping of e-waste ( pictured ) victim : @entity16 produced only 38,000 metric tonnes of e-waste in 2014 compared to the @entity7 's 1.5 million but its landfills have become a graveyard for the world 's useless microchips , light bulbs and motherboards ( pictured ) inexpensive : even old wiring is dumped in @entity15 ( pictured ) because it is cheaper to ship them to @entity3 than it is to recycle it in @entity51 nations this sometimes - illegal and environmentally damaging practice plaguing @entity16 is driven by cheap dumping prices in comparison to the cost of recycling in the countries where it comes from			1
dr @entity132 said : ' these shipments are taking place and increasingly so			0
the reasoning behind it is quite simple - economic and financial			0
' recycling in the @entity51 and the @entity7 costs money			0
so if a broker successfully collects enough material and sends it to @entity3 , it could be in their interest because in people in @entity3 are still paying for this			2
' the ' recycling ' of e-waste in @entity15 is a dangerous business which often involves burning it in unmonitored landfill sites , according to @entity24			1
the waste discarded in 2014 contained around 300 tonnes of gold , 16 million tonnes of iron and nearly two million tonnes of copper as well as significant amounts of silver , aluminium and palladium			1
and alarmingly , it also contained ' substantial amounts ' of life - threatening toxic material like mercury and cadmium which can cause organ failure and severe mental impairment if they pollute the local water supply			2
in the deadly fields of @entity15 , photographer @entity240 has seen young men braving toxic fumes and explosive appliances in what she deems ' the chaotic heart of one of @entity3 's biggest economies '			2
she has witnessed boys as young as 14 trawling barefoot through acres of what could be deadly waste material which may cause them irreparable harm			0
@entity257 adds : ' the electronic waste leaks lead , mercury , arsenic , zinc and flame - retardants			1
they 've been found in toxic concentrations in the air , water , and even on the fruits and vegetables at the wholesale market			0
' dumped : e-waste graveyards in @entity3 ( pictured ) are damaging the health of the scavengers and the local environment , according to a @entity24 report poverty : @entity24 claims the recycling of e-waste can help developing economies by giving shipping over cheap appliances but most of the equipment reaches @entity3 broken and useless ( pictured ) scavengers : the young men who look through the wreckage in @entity15 , @entity34 ( pictured ) are exposed to toxic materials which seep from some discarded products danger : young men brave toxic fumes and explosive appliances in @entity15 ( pictured ) , in what one local journalist calls ' the chaotic heart of one of @entity3 's biggest economies ' hazardous : @entity297 - a photographer who has visited the fields of @entity15 - says the electronic waste ( pictured ) ' leaks lead , mercury , arsenic , zinc and flame - retardants ' many old fridges that now reside in filthy landfill sites such as @entity15 contain chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons ( @entity80 ) which damage the ozone layer			1
@entity24 's research discovered the majority of e-waste , nearly 60 per cent , consisted of large and small domestic appliances rather than discarded electronics like mobile phones and computers			2
it included a gigantic 12.8 megatons of small items such as microwaves and toasters and 18.8 megatons of ' white goods ' such as fridges , washing machines , dryers and other larger appliances			0
the @entity7 was identified as one of the world 's largest generators of e-waste and ranked fifth in the world in terms of material discarded per person , with each @entity333 producing 23.5kg every year			2
it also produced the sixth most e-waste overall and its 1.5 megatons of waste was only 100,000 tonnes less than @entity337 which has 20 times the population			2
the @entity24 report said that only one - third of e-waste in the @entity7 is recycled through recognised schemes , a figure that must reach 85 per cent by 2019 under @entity51 rules			0
according to the @entity345 , @entity24 researcher @entity344 said : ' in the @entity7 we are seeing that the ' lifespan ' of an electric or electronic product may be particularly short			0
' we should not simply try to stop consumption to minimise the amount of waste being generated , but should instead make sure that it is properly collected and recycled			0
there is an opportunity to create jobs and extract those resources currently being discarded			0
' health : the toxins leaking from discarded appliances in @entity34 's @entity15 landfill could be causing irreparable harm to the young men ( pictured ) who scavenge through the site decay : despite millions of tonnes of e-waste and appliances making its way to @entity3 , much of it can not be sold and is left to rot in the huge landfills desperate : local @entity16 's sift through mounds of old chargers in the hope that some of the still work and can be sold at market the weight of last year 's e-waste is comparable to over 1.1 million 18 - wheel trucks - enough to form a line from @entity383 to @entity384 and back			1
and yet less than one - sixth of last year 's e-waste is thought to have been diverted to proper recycling and reuse			0
while the @entity388 and @entity389 produce almost a third of the world 's combined e-waste , the top producers per - capita are the wealthy nations of northern and western @entity83 - the top five being @entity394 , @entity395 , @entity396 , @entity397 , and the @entity7			0
the escalating global e-waste problem is driven by the rising sales and shortening life cycles of electrical and electronic equipment , according @entity403 under - secretary - general and @entity404 of @entity24			0
@entity405 said : ' worldwide , e-waste constitutes a valuable ' urban mine ' - a large potential reservoir of recyclable materials			0
at the same time , the hazardous content of e-waste constitutes a toxic mine ' that must be managed with extreme care			0

new report says 41 million metric tonnes of electronic waste worth a staggering £ 34billion was discarded in 2014
countries illegally export ' millions of tonnes ' of e-waste annually to @entity3 nations like @entity16 , campaigners say
shocking photographs from its capital @entity34 show thousands of discarded appliances in huge , filthy landfill sites
some contain toxic materials like lead and mercury which damage environment and people sifting through them
