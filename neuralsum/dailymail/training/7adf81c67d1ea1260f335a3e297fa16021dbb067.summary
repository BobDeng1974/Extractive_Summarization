we 've all been there — bored to tears at school , clock - watching , thinking you might actually nod off			2
and then @entity6 hammer on the classroom door and pull you out of the lesson so you can fly to @entity9 and sit on the bench in a @entity12 group game against @entity13			1
@entity14 was 16 years old when he was taken out of a technical drawing class to join up with the @entity6 squad in 1997			1
against @entity17 he will become the man who has played more games in the competition — 144 — than any other			0
he has won it three times in a 15 - year first - team career and he has news for anyone who might think his time at the top is almost up			1
@entity14 celebrates winning the @entity12 with @entity6 after beating rivals @entity28 @entity14 has won three @entity12 titles during his 15 years in the @entity6 first team ‘ i think i can play on until i ’m 40 , ’ @entity14 told @entity31			1
and he does n’t mean play on in less demanding surroundings			2
‘ i started here and i want to finish here , ’ he says , crushing any talk that this will be his last season at the club			2
he has become the villain in the eyes of some supporters in recent years			1
a whispering campaign pinned him , mistakenly he says , as the mole in the dressing room that @entity44 gradually lost control of at @entity6			1
but there are also those at the club who will always see him as the local kid made good			2
‘ they pulled me out of school because @entity51 and @entity52 were injured and they needed me as a second keeper , ’ he says of that day back in november 1997			0
‘ i was taken to the headmaster , who by the way was a big @entity6 fan , and before i knew it i was on a school minibus going home , where my mum was frantically packing my bag for me			1
the other kids had no idea why i had left the class and there was no @entity67 or mobile phones to tell them what was happening			0
’ @entity14 ' reputation was damaged when it was claimed he was a dressing room mole under @entity44 @entity52 ended up recovering and young @entity14 was only @entity6 ’s third keeper but coach @entity74 still told him to get changed and take his place on the bench			1
‘ i knew who they all were , but no - one had a clue who i was , ’ he says of his illustrious team - mates			1
‘ i sat on the same table before the game as @entity52 and @entity85 but i never said a word			0
’ @entity14 says he has n’t ‘ done the maths ’ as to how many games he will play in the @entity12			1
‘ the immediate challenge is to win it two years in a row , ’ he says			2
‘ if we show the same desire we did last year , why not ? first we have to get through to the knockout stages			0
’ defeating @entity17 would make sure of that but he sees one major reason why it will not be as easy as some are suggesting			0
‘ @entity17 have to win , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity100 teams never back down			0
@entity17 will come here to a stadium where they have won before and they will give it everything			0
’ the visitors have their own @entity14 in @entity104 : the one - club man whom the @entity6 keeper calls ‘ the essence of @entity17 ’			1
the @entity6 legend trains while summer signing and @entity110 international @entity109 watches on @entity14 will make his 144th @entity12 appearance when his side take on @entity17 at the @entity113 ‘ these are the players that give the club its identity , ’ he says			1
‘ @entity118 and @entity119 at @entity120 and @entity121 at @entity122 — players with a genuine link to the supporters			0
and if you are happy and playing well at a big club then you never have a reason to go anywhere else			2
’ having sought @entity104 out for a shirt swap at @entity131 , @entity14 says he will look for @entity132 , although not at half - time			1
‘ you can swap shirts at half - time in @entity136 and it ’s no problem , ’ he says of @entity132 ’s troubles a fortnight ago			1
@entity14 ’s career at @entity6 has brought him grief and glory			1
@entity44 benched him , bringing in @entity141 , whom he said he felt was a better keeper			0
@entity144 ’s diplomatic solution to the over-booking he inherited was to play @entity141 in the league and @entity14 in the @entity147 and the @entity12			1
he promptly won the two tournaments he was part of while @entity6 could finish only third in the league			1
@entity14 said he will look to swap shirts with @entity132 when his side take on @entity17 @entity14 has won five league titles , three @entity154 , the @entity155 and two @entity157 championships the @entity12 won last may in @entity158 was the club ’s 10th and in the ecstasy of the immediate aftermath he told reporters it felt even better than winning the @entity155 , although he now puts that down to the sheer relief as his mistake that allowed @entity28 to score the opening goal no longer mattered			1
‘ when it happens you stand there on the goal - line thinking about it and you want to leave your penalty area and try to get the equaliser yourself but you know you ca n’t			2
so you can imagine how i felt when @entity174 ’s header went in			0
‘ one of the sad things about football is that people only remember the most recent thing you have done			2
my mistake allowed @entity28 to take the lead			0
winning a trophy is not about one game , it ’s about the whole season and fighting to reach the final and my season in the competition had been very good			0
‘ but we had been in control of the game and an absurd moment from me looked like costing us the match			0
‘ i remember looking around the stadium and seeing thousands of people with the white shirts and i felt terrible			2
luckily in the last move of the game we got the draw and then i think the extra time reflected how much better we really were			0
@entity14 is captain of both @entity6 and @entity136 , and has made 158 appearances for his country ‘ @entity174 ’s goal rescued me from a lot of criticism			1
i ’m sure quite a few papers had to change their headlines in that last minute			0
’ it takes a certain type of toughness to succeed at a club like @entity6 for so long			1
@entity14 has bounced back this season			1
his form of late for his club side has been excellent			2
the mistake against @entity216 paved the way for @entity218 , whom he describes as ‘ both the present and future of @entity222 football ’ , to replace him for the national side but he says he ’ll keep playing with the @entity136 team until at least @entity225			0
and with @entity6 the obsession for the decima has quickly been replaced by the need to win the undecima ( 11th )			1
‘ this club is so big that winning the @entity12 buys you about a month ’s grace , ’ he smiles			0
‘ when you have as good a team as we have then you have to try to go out and win it again			0
there is no place for biding your time			0
you get a crash course in impatience when you join			0
’ eleven must follow 10 — it ’s the @entity6 way .			2
