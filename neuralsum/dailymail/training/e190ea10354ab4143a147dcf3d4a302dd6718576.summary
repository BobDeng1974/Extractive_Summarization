archbishop @entity0 , 60 , claimed diplomatic immunity to avoid handing documents to prosecutors investigating two paedophile priests a @entity6 archbishop , appointed by @entity7 as his new foreign minister , claimed diplomatic immunity to avoid handing over @entity11 documents to prosecutors investigating two paedophile priests			1
archbishop @entity0 , 60 , from @entity13 was promoted on saturday to the third highest position in the @entity11 as part of a reshuffle by @entity7			1
but the appointment of the former papal envoy to @entity19 to the @entity11 's most senior hierarchy will be a blow for campaigners against clerical sex abuse			0
earlier this year the @entity24 said it was ' concerned ' after mr @entity0 cited diplomatic immunity in response to repeated requests by prosecutors for documents on two priests that abused more than 100 children over 40 years			1
a report by the @entity34 against @entity35 reported that the @entity11 was still ' resisting the principle of mandatory reporting of allegations to civil authorities ' , and withholding information , citing @entity0 by name			2
only after months of bureaucratic wrangling and an embarrassing diplomatic standoff did the archbishop eventually agree to turn over some of the documents which were wanted as part of an inquiry into @entity19 's worst abuse scandal			2
the @entity50 diocese has been described as the country 's ' epicentre ' of catholic clerical abuse with 400 known victims			0
@entity0 was asked for information on father @entity56 , an @entity57 priest who preyed on pre-pubescent girls was known to the church as a paedophile since the 1970s but for decades he was moved from parish to parish in @entity19 and posted overseas to @entity62 , @entity63 and the @entity64			1
he was eventually defrocked in a secret process in exchange for ' keeping his good name '			0
the documents requested also referred to father @entity69 , who was convicted of abusing four victims over three decades including the rape of an altar boy , a crime for which he was sentenced to almost eight years prison , where he died in 2006			1
copies of correspondence released by the @entity78 special commission of inquiry show prosecutors requested documents from @entity0 on 30 august 2013			2
the nuncio sent an interim response , stating that he was submitting the request to @entity83 but after no response almost two months later the prosecutors were forced to write again to both @entity0 and the @entity11 to follow up the request			2
pope @entity7 recently appointed mr @entity0 as his new foreign minister , the third highest position in the @entity11 three weeks later @entity0 eventually replied reminding the commissioner that his office was ' the high diplomatic representative of the @entity11 to the @entity92 ' and cited ' the protections afforded by international agreements , including the @entity95 '			1
the convention states that the archives and documents of a diplomatic mission ' shall be inviolable at any time and wherever they may be '			2
without this ' high principle of international relations ' ' diplomatic missions would no longer be able freely to carry out their domestic and international responsibilities ' , he claimed			0
he was asked about father @entity56 , an @entity57 priest who preyed on pre-pubescent girls and was known as a danger since the 1970s he said his office would consider ' specific requests ' for information , ' bearing in mind the expectation that it would not be appropriate to seek internal communications '			1
on 14 november the @entity78 crown solicitor , @entity113 , wrote to @entity0 for a third time			0
in his letter @entity113 reminded the nuncio of a guarantee by cardinal @entity118 that ' every document the @entity11 had ' would be made available to a separate inquiry into child sexual abuse in the same year			0
' of course , this @entity122 is separate and distinct from both the @entity122 and the @entity123 , ' @entity113 wrote , ' ' but i trust that the sentiment of co-operation would similarly extend to this @entity122 's processes			0
' eventually on 6 december 2013 @entity0 forwarded copies of correspondence between the @entity130 and the then @entity131 , as well as other letters , which the commission already had copies of			0
but he declined to forward any ' internal communications ' , between the @entity11 diplomatic missions in @entity19 and in the @entity64 saying ' such communications are confidential , as is the case for those of the diplomatic missions of any country			0
' @entity0 was appointed following the demotion of ultra-conservative @entity144 cardinal @entity143 , who has led open opposition to @entity7 ' leadership saying the church is ' without a rudder ' .			1

archbishop @entity0 appointed by @entity7 as foreign minister
refused to hand over documents on two priests who abused 100 children
he was asked about father @entity56 as @entity157 was *aware* of crimes
also requested to give evidence about paedophile father @entity69
but cited diplomatic immunity to avoid handing in response to requests
