not for @entity0 the mad dash around @entity2 that @entity3 is embarking on in order to qualify for next month 's year - end festivities at @entity7 's @entity6			1
the @entity9 master has long since qualified for the eight - man field , and while the 27 year - old @entity11 makes his late entry into this week 's @entity13 the question is whether , at 33 , @entity0 can finish the season as world number one			1
sunday 's new rankings saw him back at number two ahead of @entity19 and , based purely on points won in 2014 , within one thousand points – potentially a week 's work – behind @entity23			2
@entity0 lets out a roar as the 33 - year - old won his first @entity27 title on sunday against @entity28 as @entity0 reflected following his victory at the @entity30 on sunday : ' usually everything slows down at the end of the season			1
not for me this time			0
' he was also referring to the fact that , following the @entity37 in @entity7 next month , he will play for @entity9 in this year 's @entity39 final , the only significant prize in tennis he has yet to win but which is now possible with @entity42 as his team - mate			1
two variable factors are involved in this late season drama for @entity0			0
one surrounds whether he will have the energy to carry it all off , as although he is off this week he is due to play in @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity7 before the @entity39			0
@entity0 kisses the trophy after winning the @entity51 ahead of a busy end - of - season period confetti rains down as @entity0 receives his trophy in front of a capacity crowd at the @entity57 the other , specifically relating to the ranking situation , is whether @entity23 will turn up in both @entity49 and @entity7 , which are the two remaining fixtures carrying heavy ranking rewards			2
his wife @entity62 is due to give birth sometime next month ( he has kept the due date secret ) , and that could affect his participation in at least one of those			0
@entity3 will play in @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity49 , making it six weeks ' worth of consecutive tournaments as he tries to make it back into the world 's top eight			1
assuming everyone is fit and present in @entity7 , @entity3 is effectively battling five others players – @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 – for three places at the 02 from his current standing of tenth			0
@entity3 is desperate to qualify for the @entity87 and is playing six tournaments in a row four have already qualified ( @entity23 , @entity0 , @entity19 and @entity42 ) while world number six @entity90 is a certainty due to an obscure rule that makes it easier for the season 's @entity95 winners to get in			1
the tennis season sometimes has a humdrum feel in october , but the fact that the spoils have been shared more evenly among the men this year has injected life into both the ' race to @entity7 ' and for the world number one position			0
it has led @entity3 to completely change his tune from what he said at the @entity110 , where he insisted that he would not overplay to try and make the field for @entity7			0
the women 's season - end finals , which take place next week in @entity115 , had its field set relatively early , although there is a chance @entity120 could overtake @entity121 as world number one , especially as the @entity123 has been troubled by a knee injury .			2

the world no 2 has a packed *schedule* before the end of season tour finals
@entity0 is back at no 2 in the rankings after winning @entity27 title
the @entity9 could win the @entity39 and end the year top of the rankings
@entity136 's @entity3 still hopes to qualify for the @entity87
