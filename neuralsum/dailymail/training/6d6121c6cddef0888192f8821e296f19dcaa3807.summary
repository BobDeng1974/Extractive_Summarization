by @entity0 when a man regarded as the deadliest sniper in @entity5 history detailed his kills in a bestselling autobiography , he also included details about a 2006 incident in which he says he punched a guy he called ‘ @entity11 ’ — later identified as former @entity13 gov. @entity12			1
@entity12 , a public figure with a tough - guy image , says the fight did n't happen , and he sued author @entity17 for defamation			1
the trial begins tuesday , and it will be up to @entity12 's attorneys to prove that @entity17 's account about that night in a @entity23 bar was false — and even more difficult , that @entity17 knew it			1
‘ @entity12 is going to have to prove falsity ... but the harder part is proving actual malice , ’ said @entity25 , a law professor at @entity26 in @entity27			0
‘ it has to do with what you know about the truth — that you actually knew that what you were saying was false or that you recklessly disregarded the truth			0
’ the suit must go on : ¿ it 's about clearing my name			0
it 's a lie , @entity41 told @entity0 in february about the reference to him in @entity17 's 2012 autobiography			2
@entity17 used the name @entity11 for a man whom he punched out in a bar for disparaging @entity48			2
@entity11 was later revealed to be @entity12 besides sorting out what happened in the bar , jurors will have to assess whether @entity12 's reputation was damaged and whether @entity17 used @entity12 's name to make a profit			1
@entity17 and a friend were killed in february 2013 at a @entity57 gun range , allegedly by an @entity58 they were trying to help			1
@entity17 's widow , @entity60 , is now the defendant			0
big money may be at stake			0
court documents show @entity17 's book had earned royalties of more than $ 3 million as of june 30 , 2013 , and the judge already has ruled that proceeds from an upcoming movie could be subject to damages , too			1
@entity12 has said the case is n't about money			0
‘ it 's about clearing my name			0
it 's a lie , ’ @entity12 told @entity0 in february			0
@entity12 and @entity60 are both expected to testify during the trial , which will likely last more than two weeks			0
defendant : @entity17 , seen here in 2012 , claims ' @entity11 ' disparaged the president and said the @entity79 deserve to ' lose a few ' at a bar @entity17 died when an @entity58 vet he was allegedly trying to help shot him and a friend at a @entity57 gun range in 2013 @entity12 , a former @entity79 and pro wrestler whose post-political life has included hosting several cable tv shows , claims @entity17 defamed him to gain notoriety for his best - selling 2012 book , ‘ @entity91 , ’ which describes his kills of insurgents from 1999 to 2009			1
a movie based on the book , starring @entity94 , is in production			0
claim to fame : @entity17 is to date the most deadly of all @entity5 snipers			2
the autobiography in which he allegedly defamed @entity12 is called @entity5 sniper in the book , @entity17 describes an incident in which he claims @entity12 was speaking loudly against president @entity48 , the @entity58 and @entity79 tactics			1
@entity17 , also a former @entity79 , claimed @entity12 said the @entity79 ‘ deserve to lose a few			1
’ @entity17 wrote that he punched @entity12 , knocking him to the ground			2
@entity12 denies making those statements , and says @entity17 never laid a hand on him			2
@entity17 had maintained the events in the book are true , and the essence of what was said is accurate , court documents say			0
both sides have witnesses to back up their version of events ; and attorneys have cast doubt on the opposing witnesses ' credibility			0
while @entity17 's book says ‘ rumor has it ’ @entity12 had a black eye the next day , photos of @entity12 from that time do n't show him with any visible injury , according to court documents			1
in march , @entity5 district judge @entity127 — no relation to @entity17 or @entity60 — said the case could go forward because @entity12 had offered sufficient evidence that could lead a jury to conclude @entity17 's statements were false			1
but because @entity12 is a public figure , the judge wrote , @entity12 must show ‘ actual malice ’ or prove by clear and convincing evidence that @entity17 knew the statements were false or acted in reckless disregard of the truth			1
@entity25 said @entity12 has a high bar to clear , and to win damages , he must also prove his reputation was harmed in a quantifiable way			0
in a november deposition , @entity12 said his job offers dried up after the book was published , and he was worried about being seen as a traitor to the military			0
he also said publicity @entity17 got from interviews about the alleged incident with @entity12 helped @entity17 's book sales and led to the film option			1
the defense argues in court documents that the public embraced @entity17 's book for reasons ‘ completely unrelated to any passing reference to @entity12 , ’ and that the book has been more successful than any @entity12 has written .			2

a @entity13 judge said this week that @entity12 's suit against @entity5 sniper author @entity17 may go forward
@entity17 claimed in his bestselling 2012 to have won a fight against a man called @entity167 , later @entity168 *'d* as the former @entity13 *governor*
@entity17 was gunned down in 2013 by an @entity58 he was trying to help at a @entity57 gun range
