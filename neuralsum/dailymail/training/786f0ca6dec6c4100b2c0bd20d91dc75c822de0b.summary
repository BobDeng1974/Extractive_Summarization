at 11.11am on monday , 27 november 1944 , a mushroom cloud , 50 yards wide , rose high above the village of @entity2 , @entity3			1
mounds of earth , weighing up to a ton each , fell to the ground after being lifted skywards			2
a nearby reservoir that had contained six million gallons of water was burst open			1
and a massive crater - 100 feet deep and 250 yards wide - was blasted into the unspoiled landscape			1
this lasting scar , the @entity12 , is a reminder of when the 4,000 tonnes of bombs and ammunition kept in the underground storerooms of @entity17 , @entity3 , detonated in a single , deadly moment			1
the accident , @entity21 's biggest ever explosion , claimed the lives of at least 70 people and tore down homes in the nearby village of @entity2			1
untamed : while the area of the crater , seen above in 2005 , is home to birds and wildlife - humans are not allowed to walk across it lasting mark : the 1944 explosion blasted a massive crater - 100 feet deep and 250 yards wide ( seen from above ) - into the landscape scarred : the 12 - acre patch of countryside ( circled ) - which is now filled with trees and shrubs - is cordoned off because of unexploded bombs today , a poignant memorial was unveiled , marking the 70th anniversary of the explosion - one of the biggest non-nuclear blasts ever recorded			1
more than 100 people attended the service , with family and friends of the 70 people who were killed gathering at the @entity50 in @entity2 - which was seriously damaged in the explosion - to mark the anniversary			1
a memorial service was also held at @entity54 in the @entity3 village			2
the explosion was thought to have released about one - fifth of the force felt when the atom bomb was dropped on @entity59			2
it was heard in @entity61 - 32 miles away - and seismologists in @entity63 thought they had detected an earthquake			0
the historic explosions occurred in 180,000 sq ft of underground corridors - 12ft high and 20ft wide - which were used to store @entity69 munitions during the @entity70			1
in these concrete passages , bombs and ammunition were tightly packed			2
during the wartime rush - when officers faced a shortage of quality manpower , and a higher demand on resources - corners were cut in the way the unit was run			0
@entity82 , who has been researching the explosion for 30 years , said an @entity69 inquiry into the explosion , which was only published in 1974 , found it was an avoidable accident			2
aftermath : the force of the blast , which killed at least 70 people , destroyed homes and shops in the nearby village of @entity2 , @entity3 blast : workers survey what remains in one part of the underground munitions storage unit at @entity17 after the devastating explosion wreckage : an @entity69 inquiry into the explosion found it was an avoidable accident			1
above , a building brought to the ground by the blast crushed : part of the tunnel is seen collapsed on top of one of the rows of bombs that were stacked underground during the @entity70 he added : ' the most likely explanation , according to the report , was that someone tried to remove an exploder pocket with a brass chisel			1
that caused a spark which set off the reaction			2
' the report concluded : ' an airman was permitted to perform a dangerous operation in the mine			2
this indicates negligence on the part of the supervising staff present in the mine due either to lack of knowledge , lack of a proper sense of responsibility , or lack of proper direction from senior authority			0
' a solid underground wall meant that much of the underground storeroom did not go up on the blast - and a number of the men working made it to the surface on time			1
most of the deaths , roughly 31 in total , came at a nearby plasterboard factory , when the blast broke a reservoir that sent a volcano - like sea of mud down a valley and engulfed everything in the way			1
damage : one worker ventures underground to assess the extent of the destruction caused by the bombs , which detonated simultaneously devastating : this photograph shows just one of the nearby homes that were struck by the force of the blast fatal : most of the deaths , roughly 31 in total , came at a nearby plasterboard factory			1
above , the collapsed tunnel photographed after the blast the rescue work took three months and was hindered by pockets of gas , 6 million gallons of water from the reservoir and 10,000 tons of rubble			2
tragically , 18 of the 70 people killed were never found			1
the giant crater left behind by the blast is still visible 70 years on but is now filled with trees and shrubs and is home to birds and wildlife			1
there are also signs warning ramblers or passers - by not to go into the area - which covers a 12 - acre patch of countryside - because of unexploded bombs			0
near the edge of the crater is the first memorial for the tragedy , where the names of those who lost their lives are carved			0
a service used to be held at the site every year until a decade ago when numbers dwindled and it was dropped after the 60th anniversary			0
parish council chairman @entity201 said : ' there was much more interest in that than a service by the crater and the parish council are supporting it			0
what remained : despite the force of the blast , parts of the underground storage facility survived			1
@entity12 only ceased holding explosives in 1958 tribute : a sign near the edge of the crater remembers those who lost their lives			0
sadly , 18 bodies were never recovered in the search operation @entity222 : a service to remember those who died in the explosion is held every year at @entity12 , pictured above ' there has been a big response			0
we believe the @entity69 at @entity229 and the @entity230 will be among the people attending			0
i think it will be a fitting way to mark the anniversary			0
' the outdoor services began when the memorial was erected 30 years ago but ten years ago there was only three of us , including the vicar			0
there was one lady who lost her brother but she admitted that it was getting beyond her			0
' reverend @entity244 , who conducted the service , said : ' we want to mark the anniversary for the village			0
people are still affected by it , it left its mark			0
' at @entity253 we will be unveiling the new memorial plaque and there will a short act of worship			0
there were people from different parts of the church killed , the @entity259 pows would have been catholic			2
' it 's not just a @entity266 event but for the whole community			0

the underground munitions storage depot at @entity17 , near @entity2 , @entity3 , exploded in november 1944
at least 70 people were killed in the blast , a reservoir was destroyed and a nearby factory brought to the ground
an inquiry concluded that the explosion was caused when an airman caused a spark in the concrete storeroom
today , a massive crater that is 100 feet deep and 250 yards wide marks the site of @entity21 's biggest ever explosion
