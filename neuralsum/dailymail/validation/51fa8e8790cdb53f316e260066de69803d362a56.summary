' @entity0 told @entity49 ' i wish they would have [ outside ] walls here			0
personally , just so i would have had to put a clip on it instead of junking a race car that i only had 12 laps on			0
' because there are no outside walls around the slightly banked track , there was nothing to stop @entity0 's car as it drove off the half - mile track peril : @entity0 's car rolled at least once before finding the parking lot on the edge : @entity0 's car teetered on its side during the crash , as evidenced in this close - up still taken from footage of the accident health : @entity0 has said he was sore from the accident but otherwise alright			1
