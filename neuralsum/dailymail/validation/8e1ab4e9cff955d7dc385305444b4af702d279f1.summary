sir @entity0 , chief inspector of schools and children ’s services , said saving youngsters from exploitation required ‘ political and moral courage ’ on the part of local leaders			1

his warning came amid the row over the failure of social workers , politicians or police to act against gangs of mostly @entity32 men who exploited hundreds of children in @entity34 and @entity35			1
an inquiry last month said @entity34 councillors shied away from the issue for fear of being accused of disturbing ‘ community cohesion ’			1
it added : ‘ by failing to take action against the @entity32 heritage male perpetrators of child sexual exploitation in the borough , the council has inadvertently fuelled the far - right			0
’ last week an inquiry into a similar scandal in @entity35 , carried out by the head of the local safeguarding board , said there was ‘ no evidence of any agency not acting when they should have done because of racial sensitivities ’			2
but the @entity55 accused it of ‘ pulling its punches ’			0
