@entity1 's parents @entity2 and @entity3 are raising their son as a boy and a girl so he does not ' grow up aggressive ' @entity1 is a happy , healthy one - year - old boy who spent yesterday morning playing with his vast collection of toy cars , planes , tractors , and dinosaurs			1
dressed in a red checked lumberjack shirt and rust - coloured jeans , he shouted ‘ beep beep ! ’ and giggled with delight while pushing a plastic motorbike around the living room of his family home			2
then , after lunch , a strange transformation occurred			0
@entity1 scampered upstairs to his bedroom with his 23 - year - old mother , @entity2 , and re-emerged several minutes later wearing a dark blue , knee - length dress decorated with pink flamingos			1
he swiftly grabbed a blonde - haired doll , sat her in a pink plastic pram , and took her on a short walk , stopping only when it was time to pretend to breastfeed her			2
later in the afternoon , the child collected several more dolls , found a selection of pink toy cups and saucers , and staged an impromptu tea party			2
@entity1 , who turns two later this month and lives in @entity39 , is being raised according to a radical technique known as ‘ gender - neutral parenting ’			1
it means @entity2 and her husband , @entity3 , 34 , encourage him to wear both boys ’ and girls ’ clothes , and to play with conventionally female – as well as male – toys			1
rather than being worried if he decides not to play football , and asks instead for someone to paint his fingernails with glittery polish , they instead see it as a form of cute self - expression			0
‘ if @entity1 wants to wear a pink tutu and fairy wings , then he can wear it , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ he ’s just expressing himself			0
i do n’t want to put him in a certain box and treat him that way			0
i want to teach him to be whatever he wants to be			0
he can pick his own clothes and , as long as they ’re warm enough for the winter , i ’ll get him whatever he wants			0
’ @entity2 and @entity3 share the terraced home with a hamster called @entity69 , two cats , @entity71 and @entity72 , and a @entity73 called @entity74			1
visitors to the bustling home tend to be surprised , but ‘ mostly supportive ’ , of their decision to pursue gender - neutral parenting			1
‘ you get the odd funny look , and a bit of hostility , but once we explain how we are bringing our son up , and why , people tend to understand , ’ says @entity2			2
they are raising @entity1 , who turns two later this month , according to a radical technique known as ' gender - neutral parenting ' ‘ i hope that @entity1 wo n’t get teased when he ’s older			1
but part of what we are trying to do with @entity1 is to instil such a sense of confidence , and a sense of who he is , that he wo n’t care what anyone else thinks			2
’ @entity2 , a full - time housewife , took the decision to allow @entity1 to identify as either a girl or a boy 12 months ago , after seeing high - profile rape cases being discussed on parenting websites			1
‘ gender stereotypes can be so damaging			1
‘ they teach little boys to be aggressive and dominant over women , ’ she argues			0
‘ there ’s research out there saying that the whole “ boys will be boys ” thing basically teaches lads that it ’s ok to be a certain way , because it ’s in their nature to be aggressive			0
it ’s detrimental for them and for females			0
’ the decision was fully supported by @entity3 , an unemployed courier			2
‘ i think my husband is more of a feminist than i am , ’ she says			0
‘ his biggest concern about the whole thing is usually “ does @entity1 have the right shoes to go with that dress ! ” ’ @entity3 , for his part , adds : ‘ my parents told me that i played with my sister ’s dolls as a child and it does n’t bother me			1
i ca n’t see why it would bother anyone			0
’ they are adamant that @entity1 has thrived under the gender - neutral regime , pointing out that he is able to string three or four - word sentences together , and is ‘ almost ’ potty - trained			1
the concept of gender - neutral parenting first became popular among feminists in @entity146 during the 1970s , when it inspired the actress @entity147 to write a best - selling children ’s book called free to be … @entity151			1
recently , it has experienced a small revival			0
@entity1 pictured pushing his doll in a buggy in one of his favourite dresses , left , and a pink coat , right in 2011 , a @entity160 couple made headlines after refusing to reveal the gender of their new - born @entity163 in what they called ‘ a tribute to freedom and choice ’			1
the following year , a @entity171 couple , @entity172 and @entity173 , revealed they were raising their child @entity175 as gender neutral to allow his or her ‘ real personality ’ to shine through			2
in normal circumstances , @entity1 would be required to start wearing gender - specific clothes when he starts at school			1
however @entity2 and @entity3 have a contingency plan that will allow him to continue dressing as he pleases			2
‘ we ’re planning on home educating @entity1 , ’ says @entity2 , who was herself home - schooled			1
‘ however , if he does eventually choose to go to school , and wants to wear a girl ’s uniform , i certainly wo n’t stop him			0
’ she adds : ‘ it does n’t matter if he ’s homosexual , bisexual , transsexual or asexual as far as i ’m concerned			0
i did n’t give birth to him to say “ i ’m only going to love you if you ’re this way ”			0
i love him for who he is			0
