@entity3 made the controversial comment last friday night at the launch of the saturday paper , a new venture from the stable of independent publisher , @entity19 , the @entity12 reported			1
on the stage with @entity19 , also publisher of the @entity21 and the @entity22 , @entity3 said @entity19 ’s publishing ventures operated at a profit so he was not a ' demented plutocrat ' looking to push an agenda			1
of course i did n't : @entity4 communications minister @entity3 ( left ) referred to a ' demented plutocrat ' news boss during his speech to launch a new independent newspaper , but later denied he was referring to @entity10 ( right ) , instead alluding to the fictional mogul in the 1941 film , @entity32 @entity33 : on stage last friday at the launch of the new saturday paper , @entity3 said publisher @entity19 's ventures operated at a profit so he was not a ' demented plutocrat ' looking to push an agenda speculation ensued as to whether @entity3 was referring to @entity10			1
on a sunday morning blogpost , @entity3 said he was surprised people thought he was referring to @entity10			1
' @entity10 has been publishing newspapers , including today some of the world ’s most influential such as the @entity45 , the @entity46 and the @entity4 , for more than 60 years , ' @entity3 wrote			1
' and they have been and remain profitable			2
far from being a rich man like [ @entity51 ] @entity50 and many others who makes his money in some other area and then chooses to start a newspaper to promote his own political views , @entity10 started off as a newspaper man , the son of a newspaper man , and remains a newspaper man			1
' @entity3 said he had referenced the @entity61 character , @entity50 , from @entity32 earlier in his speech			2
at a loss : @entity10 ( above ) has an international news empire which includes a loss - making national @entity4 newspaper , which @entity3 denies he was referring to in his speech in a copy of the speech – written before @entity3 delivered it , and obtained by the @entity12 – the demented plutocrat comment does not appear			1
in the speech , he made observations about the state of the media , industry regulation and the potential for profit , saying the launch of @entity77 showed rumours of the death of newspapers appeared to be exaggerated , though the ' rivers of gold ' in classified advertising were drying up			2
' these days few newsrooms have the luxury of ignoring where their funding comes from , ' he said			2
' in large part , the industry is yet to settle on a single model , or even strategy , that guarantees viability			0
' i have often said that in the digital age , perhaps the scarcest commodity of all is people 's attention spans			0
' he noted the success of the @entity1 online , @entity12 and @entity101 as examples of @entity101 's media becoming more diverse			0
' while media companies jostle and vie in the new environment , the role of governments is pretty simple : to help , not hinder , new business models emerge and make it easier for companies to innovate , ' he said			0
' across my portfolio the current media , telecommunications and radio communications regulatory framework is still fundamentally based in a mid- 1990s world of relatively stable technologies and business models			0
' he said the explosion of the internet , mobile phones and social media			0
along with the the rollout of a fast broadband network and the rise of cloud computing had changed the media landscape			0
' in heavily regulated markets , tight regulation usually helps incumbents – they have armies of lawyers to help navigate complex rules and lobby governments where smaller companies lack the resources , ' he said			0
' the pressures on the regulatory arrangements and the negative impact of out - dated regulation on the sector will only increase			0
