when the talk turns to the greats of @entity4 football it is easy to rattle off the names of @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
last night , as his @entity10 team contested the @entity12 with @entity13 , the most successful coach in @entity16 history was taking it all in his stride			1
@entity18 is modest about his achievements after winning the @entity16 twice with @entity20 and again last may with @entity10			1
more than @entity7 ’s two with @entity34			0
one more final than @entity6 ’s three			0
he knows there is pressure to deliver another , perhaps even more now that @entity10 have added @entity40 and @entity41 to their stable			1
they are , as they proved yet again last night , a phenomenal team			0
the trick is to manage them , to negotiate those tricky moments when he is asked about this player or that in the frenzy before @entity12 finals			1
after naming @entity30 as the best player on the planet before this clash , he quickly added @entity56 and @entity22			0
he does n’t want to upset anyone			0
this dressing room is bulging with big names , superstars with enormous egos and worldwide acclaim from millions of supporters			0
they all want a slice of the action			0
@entity18 ’s man - management skills are perhaps unequalled , and he is seemingly liked and respected in equal measure by his squad after he landed the @entity69 — @entity70 — last may			1
that thrilling night in @entity71 , when @entity10 eventually dismantled @entity72 and beat them 4 - 1 , was his third @entity16 triumph as a coach			1
he also won it twice as a player with @entity20			0
this is the man who was sacked by @entity81 in 2011 a year after winning the @entity82 in his first season in @entity86 football			1
despite the success , @entity81 ’s defeat against @entity8 ’s @entity88 over two legs in the @entity16 second round in 2010 was the beginning of the end			0
this victory , confirmed by the brilliance of @entity22 and his two goals , adds to the aura of @entity18			2
he fended off a remarkable question about the possibility of him being sacked by @entity10 president @entity100 if he fails to land @entity101 this season			2
truth is , as club captain @entity105 explained , there is pressure to appear at @entity107 at the end of every season for the trophy parade			0
pedigree : @entity18 has a fabulous record at both domestic and @entity4 level remember @entity8 had three cracks at the @entity16 during his spell at the @entity31 and failed to reach the final with this extraordinary squad			1
@entity18 is racking up the trophies , having won league titles in @entity120 , @entity86 and @entity121			2
the challenge this season is to wrestle @entity101 back from @entity72 and fend off the inevitable threat of @entity34 when the domestic season gets under way on august 25			0
between now and then they have a two - legged @entity129 final against @entity72 before the league opener at the @entity31 against @entity131			2
everywhere you look , they are competing for trophies and they will go deep into the @entity16 again with this incredible front line rampaging across @entity4			2
behind it all is the quiet man of continental football , making the subtle tweaks to his team as they chase honours at every turn			2
@entity22 remains the face of this football club , but @entity18 is the brains behind it all .			1

despite many others being mentioned before him in terms of managerial esteem @entity18 is the most successful coach in @entity4 football
the *55* - year - old remains modest about his achievements in the game though
@entity18 led @entity10 to @entity12 glory on *tuesday* as they beat @entity13
