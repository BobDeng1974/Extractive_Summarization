by @entity0 published : 18:01 est , 16 june 2013 updated : 18:01 est , 16 june 2013 corking ! the stopper and bottle in action if your enjoyment of a good @entity7 or @entity8 has ever been delayed by having to hunt through the kitchen drawers for a corkscrew , help is at hand			0
a new invention combines the tradition of a cork stopper with the convenience of a screw cap , meaning summer picnics and romantic dinners could be just a little bit simpler from now on			2
the @entity20 is an old - fashioned cork stopper – but it has a screw thread that drinkers can twist in and out of the neck of the bottle			1
it comes with a bottle which has a matching thread , so it can be tightly resealed to keep the contents fresh			1
the innovative design is the result of a joint effort by @entity32 , the world ’s largest wine cork manufacturer , and @entity35 , the biggest global maker of glass containers			2
they are optimistic that it could be seen on shelves soon			0
the companies claim wine stored in the @entity20 tastes no different to a classic bottle – and important markers used by critics to judge wine , such as colour and smell , are also unaffected			1
they say wine from the bottles has gone down well with tasters in the @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
a spokesman said : ‘ it offers all of the ease of opening – and closing – that screw caps offer , but with totally natural eco-friendly materials			0
it also has the maturing benefits that natural cork brings to wine			2
’ she added : ‘ it can be quickly and easily implemented by wineries with only a minor adjustment to the existing filling lines			0
’ unlike other devices designed to keep wine fresh once it has been opened , the @entity20 cork can also be used for champagne , resealing it so well that a partially empty bottle will still produce a satisfying pop when it is opened			1
fresh and fine : the cork and bottle have a thread finish to allow drinkers to twist the stopper open and closed again , creating an airtight barrier @entity32 , chairman of @entity85 , said : ‘ @entity20 meets consumers ’ growing desire for sustainability and quality			1
‘ we are delighted to offer not only a 100 per cent renewable , modern product , but also a solution that enhances the wine drinking experience			0
’ his family firm is more than 140 years old and supplies traditional corks to 82 countries			0
based in @entity98 , it makes use of the country ’s huge areas of cork oak forest			0
in recent years , manufacturers have increasingly turned to cheap and easy - to - use screw caps , particularly for lower priced wines			0
but if the @entity20 proves successful , it could make a traditional cork – which some experts say improves the wine ’s flavour – just as convenient as a metal cap .			1
