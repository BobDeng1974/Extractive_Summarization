the issue of how best to balance a film 's accuracy with its entertainment value has long vexed @entity5 executives			2

@entity8 staff treated to an advanced screening of @entity18 : the @entity19 were aghast when a scene showed its characters fleeing from lava during the eruption of @entity24			1
actor @entity10 pictured in a scene from the film			2
staff from the museum have been forced to clarify that some of the exhibits featured in the movie are not actually held at the museum the film is about a museum security guard ( @entity10 , pictured ) who goes on adventures inside the museum with a group of exhibits who have come to life staff at the @entity8 ( pictured ) have forced to clarify what exhibits the museum does and does not hold after several major liberties were taken by the filmmakers the audience let out an audible gasp , with one woman screeching : ' there was no lava at @entity51 erupted with a pyroclastic flow ' , the @entity45 reported			1
the ancient @entity54 town was buried in the deadly explosion not by lava , but ash and pumice			0
@entity8 staff have now provided an information guide to rectify some points the film portrays for the purposes of entertainment , but which have little basis in reality			1
@entity67 , the musesum 's broadcast manager , told the @entity45 curators instinctively disliked inaccuracies , but she was hoping the film would draw in new visitors despite a few liberties being taken			1
she said : ' we do n't have a model of @entity24 at all , so it 's kind of moot what kind of eruption it has			0
we 're really hoping that it will encourage people who might not normally come to the museum			2
' but if they want dinosaurs they should go to the @entity86			0
' while much of the film does portray real exhibits - albeit ones which come to life - other inaccuracies include an impressive but entirely fictional triceratops skeleton			1
filmmakers were obviously building on the popularity of the previous films ' tyrannosaurus rex character when they added it into the script			0
in reality , the @entity8 holds no dinosaur skeletons - they are all located at the @entity86			1
an artists ' illustration of the eruption of @entity24 , which buried the city under a layer of ash and pumice - not lava , as depicted in @entity107 not planning to adhere to the strict rules of accuracy like that of its subject matter , @entity18 : secret of the @entity113 has taken a few liberties which may mislead those planning a visit to the @entity8			2

@entity8 directors have also been forced to remind visitors that it does not hold a ' nine - headed demon snake cast in bronze '			1
the monster was a feature of @entity148 mythology but the museum hold such object			0
medieval period enthusiasts will be disappointed to hear that the museum holds nothing that could be attributed to sir @entity154 - who the curators gently remind is a fictional character - after he makes an appearance in the film			1
nor does it have a ' medieval gallery ' through which @entity10 's character is chased by the museum 's fictional triceratops .			0
