streaming a football match on a smartphone or tablet using mobile data produces the same amount of carbon emissions as driving a petrol car for 10 miles , claims a new study			1
however watching the match when connected to @entity9 produces eight times less emissions than when the same sporting event is watched on a television set			1
according to figures from the @entity14 , the most environmentally - friendly way to watch shows , films and events per viewer is by sharing a screen with other people either at home or in the pub. streaming a football match on a smartphone or tablet using mobile data produces the same amount of carbon emissions as driving a petrol car for 10 miles , according to figures from the @entity14			1

watching the match when connected to @entity9 produces emissions eight times lower than when the same sporting event is watched on a television set			1
watching on a plasma screen could result in lifetime emissions a third higher than a similar sized led television			2
whereas a laptop could result in less than half the emissions compared to watching on a desktop computer			2
whereas going to see a game live at the stadium produces the most carbon of the lot , particularly for an away game , due to the added impact of transport			0
the reports claim watching a match on @entity59 screens is most energy efficient , followed by @entity61 and then plasma			0
it is estimated that this sunday â€™s @entity64 at @entity65 between @entity66 and @entity67 will produce 5,160 tonnes of carbon dioxide			0
this is the equivalent of the annual energy emissions of around 1,000 homes			2
the research found that when watching alone , the lowest carbon way to view football is by using a smartphone or tablet connected to broadband			1
emissions can be as much as eight times lower than watching on television , mostly due to the smaller size of the screen			0
in @entity85 , 27 per cent of smartphone owners and 63 per cent of tablet owners are now using their device to watch live tv			0
for the upcoming season both @entity88 and @entity89 are offering apps that allow football to be watched on personal devices and each device and screen sizes can vary in energy consumption			0
however , watching on a plasma screen could result in lifetime emissions a third higher than a similar sized led television			0
a laptop could result in less than half the emissions compared to watching on a desktop computer			0
during the 2010 - 11 season @entity103 reduced its own carbon footprint by more than seven per cent , compared to 2008 - 09 and the organisation achieved the @entity107			1
@entity108 , chief operating officer at the @entity14 , said : ' our work helping teams , broadcasters and the telecoms industry to continuously reduce their environmental impact will in turn help to reduce the impacts of fans when they are watching football			1
' @entity119 , managing director of @entity65 , said : ' we are continuing to find new ways to reduce our environmental impacts			0
' only a small part of the total carbon emissions associated with a game at @entity65 are in our direct control , so we are calling on fans to do their bit and help to shrink the carbon bootprint of watching football			2
' both @entity89 and @entity88 offer apps , pictured , that allow football to be watched on phones or tablets			0
the lowest carbon way to view football when using a mobile device is over broadband with emissions eight times lower than watching on television , due to the smaller size of the screen			1

@entity14 compared the emissions produced when people stream shows on a mobile phone or tablet
it discovered that streaming a football match over @entity151 had a carbon footprint ten times higher than when the same show is streamed over @entity9
this is the equivalent of driving 10 miles in a petrol car
