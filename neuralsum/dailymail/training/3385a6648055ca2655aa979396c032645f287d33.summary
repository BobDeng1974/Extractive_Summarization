by @entity0 published : 08:03 est , 18 june 2013 updated : 16:32 est , 18 june 2013 swimmer : before chairing meetings of world leaders , @entity2 stripped off to go swimming in @entity5 @entity2 dragged a reluctant police protection officer on an early morning swim in the freezing waters of @entity5			1
the prime minister , a fan of so - called ' wild swimming ' , decided he fancied a dip just after dawn today			1
' he joked with the police that they are supposed to give him " close protection " and so they had to come in , and one did , ' said a @entity17 source			1
the prime minister told colleagues that his swim , which took place just after 6am , had been ' early , brisk and cold '			1
to the delight of @entity27 officials , @entity23 president @entity22 , who normally delights in macho displays at international summits , apparently decided the @entity30 waters were too chilly and stayed in bed			1
mr @entity2 said as the summit ended : ' i can recommend a swim in the lough			2
that 's what i did			2
' i have the photographic evidence but i am not going to share it with you			2
it certainly wakes you up and gets you going for a hard day chairing this summit			2
' the prime minister later tweeted that there had been ' no sign of the @entity23 president when i was swimming in a cold @entity5 this morning , but his sporting prowess is clear '			1
the waters of @entity5 are currently around 14 degrees and the lake has also been overrun by zebra mussels , an invasive species which poses a hazard to the bare feet of swimmers			1
however , mr @entity2 ' has a @entity59 - like tendency to jump into water , no matter how cold ' , according to his biographer @entity61			1
he has said that ‘ i spent all my early years swimming in @entity62 and i know what wonderful waters there are in @entity66 '			1
more recently , the prime minister has spoken of swimming in the sea off his father - in - law @entity70 ’s estate on the @entity72			1
he also has a fondness for swimming in the lakes of @entity75 , particularly the notoriously chilly @entity76			2
' i have a guilty secret - every year since being prime minister i tell myself that i have to get to @entity75 and swim in one of the lakes			1
so far i have managed it , ' he has said			2
talks : @entity84 prime minister @entity2 joked that the lough was cold but good preparation for chairing meetings scenery : the lake has provided the backdrop for many of the photo opportunities of the summit , including this snapshot of @entity96 president @entity95 and mr @entity2 , walking with @entity99 's @entity98 @entity97 dressed : mr @entity2 had his suit on for the traditional family photo with world leaders			1
left to right : @entity103 president @entity104 , @entity106 's prime minister @entity105 , @entity108 's chancellor @entity107 , @entity23 's president @entity22 , @entity84 's prime minister @entity2 , @entity96 president @entity95 , @entity112 's president @entity111 , @entity114 's prime minister @entity113 , @entity116 's prime minister @entity115 and @entity118 president @entity117 how many police officers does it take to secure a @entity121 ? not as many as the authorities thought , if the scenes around @entity124 have been anything to go by			1
with no disorder to deal with some of the 8,000 policemen and women deployed in this quiet corner of @entity30 have found innovative ways of keeping occupied			2
a group on duty at one landmark had a competition to see who was the best bannister slider			2
others have spent their breaks enjoying the welcome sun on the town ’s riverbanks			2
and mischievous local officers reportedly broke the ice with @entity144 colleagues by driving past playing the theme tune to the tv soap @entity147			2
the prime minister is patron of the @entity150 lido in his constituency , and once dived into the sea to save historian @entity153 , a friend , from a school of dangerous jellyfish			1
mr @entity153 said it was a moment that showed the prime minister 's ' great physical as well as moral courage '			1
mr @entity2 was 29 and on holiday in @entity161 , in the @entity162 , with his wife @entity163 when they joined friends for a boat trip			0
also on board the vessel , which belonged to @entity169 journalist @entity168 , was writer and socialite @entity170 , @entity153 and his girlfriend , now his ex-wife			0
mr @entity153 , then 33 , insisted on swimming 100 yards from the boat to reach two local landmarks known as @entity177 - 80ft tall volcanic monoliths			1
' the sea was swarming with a horrible , menacing school of large jellyfish , one of which had stung me , ' he added			0
they were transparent with a green tinge and had very long tentacles			0
there must have been 40 or 50 of them , so large that you would have struggled to squash one into a bucket			0
' i yelped and squealed and waved desperately at the boat , but because of the rocks @entity168 could n't bring it in to reach me			0
' i knew that if i had to swim blind through the jellyfish , many of which were hiding under the surface , i would be repeatedly and badly stung			0
things were n't looking good			0
' action man : swimming in lakes has previously been seen as the recreation of choice for @entity23 president @entity22 , pictured taking a dip in 2009 fortunately , mr @entity2 leapt from the boat			1
' i realised he was coming to my rescue			0
he had goggles and had grabbed a spare pair for me			0
i still do n't think it 's something most people would have done , ' mr @entity153 added			0
' he swam within about 20 feet of me , through some of the jellyfish , to perform an @entity215 throw			0
it was pretty impressive - it 's not easy to throw any distance or with any accuracy when you 're in water			1
he played cricket at @entity222 , i think , so that no doubt helped			0
' i grabbed the goggles and then i could see where the jellyfish were , so i could navigate through them			0
@entity227 was doing the same			0
' it seems funny now , but at the time i was terrified			0
the welt on my arm stung for about two days			0
if @entity227 had n't rescued me and i 'd been forced to swim through the jellyfish , i would probably have been hospitalised			0
it would certainly have ruined my holiday			0
' i told him he was a hero , and i was serious			0
but he quite typically brushed it off			0
he 's always downplayed it whenever i 've mentioned it			0
' * perhaps it was @entity2 's attempt to show the @entity121 he wanted to call the tune			1
the prime minister adopted a musical theme for his personal gifts to the other leaders			1
among them was a usb stick featuring songs by lesser - known @entity84 acts , such as @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252			1
he also gave to each of them the best - selling album by a @entity84 artist in their respective @entity258 gifts were designed to highlight @entity30 brands , producers and artists			2
they included a book of photography by local artist @entity275 , bottles of 12 - year @entity271 @entity270 reserve whiskey with a personalised @entity121 label , @entity263 chocolates from @entity264 and handmade oak pens by @entity267 - based @entity266 .			1
