here are the top 10 quotes from that brilliant interview			1
@entity1 spoke to @entity3 's chief sports writer @entity2 in an exclusive interview this week @entity0 on his leadership qualities ‘ i think i can be a leader of men , but you ’re not born with that attitude			1
in the maternity ward , it ’s not girls , boys and natural leaders			1
you have to become that			1
’ @entity0 on his touchline antics and emotional nature ' i could try acting			1
i could sit down and make little notes and everyone would say i ’ve matured			1
but i know that ’s impossible			1
i ca n’t imagine being any different 500 games in			1
people thought i would calm down as a player , but i did n’t			2
the day i retired i was the same lunatic that made his debut for @entity34 in 1987			2
i ca n’t believe the other managers are not as emotionally involved as i am , either			2
i think they ’re all like me inside			2
@entity0 says he ca n't believe other managers are not as emotionally involved as he is @entity0 on his @entity1 side ‘ we ’re like @entity42			1
i do n’t think we ’ve got a group of players who are cut out for a relegation battle			2
we ca n’t be the @entity47 of last year , or the @entity48 of this year			2
digging in , blood and thunder , lump the ball in , protecting a lead , that ’s not us			2
our squad is better on the ball , they ’re more suited to pushing for a place in the @entity56			2
@entity0 on his players stepping up ‘ the players have a duty , a responsibility to fix this mess			1
i do n’t want to hear crap about how difficult it is to play at home			2
playing for a big club comes with pressure			1
anyone can do it for a lesser team — but you have to have b * * * * * * s to play for @entity1			1
this is a big club			1
' @entity1 are like @entity42 ... they 're not a group of players who are cut out for a relegation battle ' sherwood on not listening to criticism ‘ when i was at @entity79 there were times when it was difficult			1
my name would be read out and there were a few groans			1
i ’d sometimes tell @entity85 , “ i ’ll give it away more times than you ’ll get it this afternoon			2
” @entity0 on @entity90 ‘ i ’d watched him in training			1
every day was like his last on earth			2
he would cry if he lost a five - a - side			0
he played and never looked back			0
@entity0 says he loved the way @entity90 ' played and never looked back ' last season at @entity7 @entity0 on telling @entity96 to take @entity97 off in the @entity98 ‘ @entity99 ’s going mad			1
“ get f * * * * * * @entity101 off ? ” he says			0
“ he ’s the only f * * * * * * chance we ’ve got			0
” he keeps him on , he scores a hat - trick , gets us back to 4 - 3 and if it goes another 10 minutes , we win			0
the kid ’s career springboards from that performance			0
@entity0 on playing with passion ‘ the coaches used to call me @entity113 , or some rubbish			1
one day , i put one in and he said to @entity116 , “ why ’s he keep doing that ? ” i ’ve never forgotten his answer			0
“ @entity122 , you know that shirt you wear on saturday ? ” he said			0
“ that ’s the shirt he wants			0
” he was right , too			0
take a player like @entity128			0
i ’ve had lots of chats with @entity128			0
he knows what i think			0
i tell him : “ i will take desire over ability every day ”			0
obviously , the ability ca n’t be too low			0
but if you have the ability — and he has — you ’ll make it if you have desire			0
@entity0 says you must have the desire and talent to make it at the top these days the young manager was appointed last month to attempt to save @entity1 's season @entity0 on managing players ‘ so i did n’t come in here all guns blazing or wanting to be their headmaster			1
you ca n’t get personal these days , get your hair cut , and all that nonsense			0
you ’ve got to move with the times			0
i left the stick at home , and the tickling brush			0
now i feel i know them a bit better			0
some get a whack , others a tickle			0
@entity0 on @entity7 ‘ i do n’t want to be scrapping around ; i want to take them forward			1
i think i did that at @entity7			1
i did n’t leave a crumbling house — @entity161 has done a good job , but he had it laid out for him , with players like @entity165 and @entity90			0
@entity167 on managing players : ' some get a whack , others get a tickle ' ( pictured with @entity172 )			0
