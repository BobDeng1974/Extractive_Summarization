she passed away on monday at a hospice @entity17 ( pictured with her parents ) was given all - clear in 2010 after having treatment in the @entity10 however , the cancer returned a year later @entity12 and @entity13 , from @entity22 in @entity23 , were told their daughter needed proton radiotherapy - an advanced treatment that does not damage the tissue surrounding tumours , as would conventional radiotherapy			1
this means it can be used in extremely delicate areas , such as brains and eyes , to destroy tumours without causing catastrophic harm			0
the @entity4 has one low - powered proton radiotherapy machine , but it can treat only eyes , not brains.her father left his thriving fire - alarm business to raise nearly £ 170,000 to take @entity17 to the @entity10 for specialist radiotherapy			1
speaking at the time , @entity12 said : ' the head of oncology told us very candidly : " you need to ring @entity10			2
" ' he added : ' there is an experimental project to send children abroad for this treatment , but we were then told the ( @entity4 ) team would not fund our trip because @entity17 's survival chances were too low			1
' despite the devastating blow , the family refused to give up and did everything from shaking tins outside football grounds to having sponsored chest waxes to raise the cash for her trip			0
@entity64 and her daughter @entity17 who had paediatric cancer neuroblastoma in 2010 her family raised £ 170,000 - including a £ 20,000 donation from comic @entity69 who heard about @entity17 's plight - and she travelled to @entity10			1
she was given the all clear and returned to the @entity72 but last february tests showed she had developed a second tumour			1
doctors told @entity17 's parents a few weeks ago that there was nothing more they could do for her friends , relatives and a local charity raised £ 120,000 to send her to @entity10 for 10 weeks and 33 gruelling treatments which this time failed to eradicate the cancer			1

@entity17 was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2009 and needed specialist radiation treatment
@entity4 refused to put her on project to send children to @entity10 for the treatment saying her survival chances were too low
parents raised £ 170,000 and she was given all clear in 2010 after treatment
@entity146 returned in 2011 and sadly further treatment could not eradicate the *disease*
