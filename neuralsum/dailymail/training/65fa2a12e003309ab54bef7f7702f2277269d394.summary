@entity3 said it sold just 1.9 million smartphones in the quarter compared to 3.7 million in the previous the former @entity22 ceo is credited with turning around @entity22 , a data company that was sold to @entity23 in 2010			1

' @entity10 later told reporters he is dropping the interim label from his title and will stay ceo until @entity3 is on a much firmer footing			2
@entity3 also announced friday that it 's entering into a five - year partnership with @entity33 , the @entity34 company that assembles products in vast factories in @entity37			1
@entity33 , known for its manufacturing contract work on @entity40 's iphones and @entity41 , will jointly design and manufacture some @entity3 devices and manage inventory of the devices			1
' i 'm hoping we never have to have a conversation going forward about inventory write downs , ' @entity10 said			0
he said @entity33 's @entity3 phones will be released in march or april and will be built in @entity50 and @entity51			1

@entity10 said the market has spoken			0
@entity3 said it sold just 1.9 million smartphones in the quarter compared to 3.7 million in the previous quarter			1
most of those were old @entity3 7 devices			2
this year 's launch of @entity3 , its revamped operating system , and fancier devices â € ” the touchscreen @entity76 and @entity78 for keyboard loyalists â € ” was supposed to rejuvenate the brand and lure customers			1
but the much - delayed phones failed to turn the company around and have led to a billion dollar loss last quarter and a multibillion loss in the third quarter			1
' it was ugly , ' said @entity88 , an analyst at @entity89			0
the @entity76 smartphone failed to be a success @entity88 initially said allowing @entity3 devices to be made by @entity33 's operations in @entity37 could pose a problem for a company that relies on governments for a lot of its business because @entity3 has long emphasized security			1
but @entity88 later noted the devices will be made in @entity50 and @entity51 and that @entity3 will continue to make high end phones so that alleviates concerns			2

its adjusted loss from continuing operations , which excludes restructuring and other items , was $ 354 million , or 67 cents per share			0

the stock is up 13.6 percent , or 85 cents , to $ 7.10 in afternoon trading			0

indeed , @entity3 reported a strong cash position at the end of the quarter with $ 3.2 billion and no debt			2
the company 's market capitalization is $ 3.2 billion			0
the @entity3 smartphone , pioneered in 1999 , had been the dominant mobile device for on - the - go business people and other consumers before @entity40 introduced the @entity137 in 2007			1
@entity40 's device showed that phones could handle much more than email and calls			1
in the years since , @entity142 has been hammered by competition from the @entity137 as well as @entity145 - based rivals			0
@entity10 is putting more emphasis on @entity3 's mobile device management business , a collection of software that allows it departments to manage different devices connected to their corporate networks			2
he is also emphasizing @entity3 's popular @entity154 application that is now also available on @entity40 and @entity145 devices			1
