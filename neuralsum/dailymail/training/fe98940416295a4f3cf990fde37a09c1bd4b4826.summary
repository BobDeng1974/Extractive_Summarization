but now a new life stage called ' emerging adulthood ' has been coined to cope with the trend for young people flying the nest later in life			1
the reasons for ' emerging adults ' staying at home includes a diminishing number of blue - collar jobs , expensive housing and an increasing need for extended studies , but scientists believe the phenomenon means people in their twenties are experiencing an extended period of youth			2
research by @entity30 's @entity29 , @entity31 , said moving out can constitute a ' crisis ' for young adults but parents are best placed to provide practical help ( pictured ) as well as emotional support and a financial safety net just over 42 per cent of adults aged 20 to 29 still lived with their parents in 2011 , according to a census from @entity41 , compared to 32 per cent ten years earlier and 27 per cent in 1981			1
