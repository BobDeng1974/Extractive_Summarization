little chef : @entity1 with a cake he made but will not be able to eat because has a rare condition which means he has to be fed through a tube for most , the best part of baking a cake is rushing to taste it after it comes out of the oven			1
but this pint - sized master chef has never been able to taste one of his own creations because he is unable to eat them			1
due to a rare disorder , @entity1 can not eat normal foods and relies on being fed a nutritious formula directly into his small bowel through a tube			1
however , last week on his fifth birthday he was treated to two cakes – a real one which he gave to his friends and family as well as a replica model which he can keep to remind him of his special day			2

@entity1 with his food replacement formula and pump which feeds him directly into his small bowel support : @entity1 with his parents @entity53 and @entity55 who had to teach the five - year - old how to take his food through a tube this meant mrs @entity26 and @entity1 ’s dad @entity55 , 39 , had to teach the youngster to take in his food through tubes leading to a backpack which feeds him			1
mrs @entity26 , a former children ’s nurse , said : ' it is his lifeline , and provides him with all of his nourishment , and his medicine , and he has a hypoallergenic milk			0
' he carries a little back - pack around with him which contains his special food and his pump and he just gets on with it			2

' little baker : @entity1 loves to spend his time in the kitchen baking cakes for his family and friends due to a rare disorder , @entity1 can not to eat normal foods and relies on being fed with a nutritious formula directly into his small bowel getting ready to bake : @entity1 places his cake mix into the over and ca n't wait to see the end result mr and mrs @entity26 do n’t hide food from him and amazingly , @entity1 loves to cook , despite being unable to eat the results			1

' he loves to cook and he ’s always baking or helping me make meals			0
' @entity1 is perfectly happy to be around others when they are eating , and food is still part of his life - we do n’t hide away from him when we ’re eating			1
the good mixer : @entity1 with his mother @entity53 at their family home in @entity35 ' we do go out for meals and do n’t hide away			2

' @entity1 still has to attend @entity113 ( @entity113 ) to have treatment			2

@entity1 looks delighted with his cake after it has came out of the over but sadly he wo n't be able to try it ' he just carries on and smiles , and it ’s the best place for him to be because of all the research they do			2
' we have been through a massive amount which i would not wish on anyone but it has to be worked out what is best for him , and that ’s what they are fantastic at doing			0
' we are lucky that we are in the best hospital in the country			0
