researchers have found that even walking to the bus stop or cleaning your home can help you lose weight and lower your cholesterol			1
activities like mowing the lawn and even fishing can also lower your risk of heart disease			1
healthy : the @entity18 study found that short bursts of exercise , including household tasks such as cleaning and mowing the grass , can be as healthy as more lengthy exercise a @entity18 study found that so long as the 10 minute bursts make up your daily quota of exercise , you will see the difference on your body			1
it concluded that ‘ some exercise is better than nothing ’ and that by adding up the small things you can have big impact			2
for the experiment the researchers attached a motion detector to to 2,109 men and woman with an average age of 47			0
more than half were overweight			0
the sensor - called an accelerometer - allowed them to monitor all their activity , rather than asking them to fill out a questionnaire in which they might not have listed everything they did			0
the results showed that compared to those who did not do enough exercise , everyone who did so weighed less , had lower @entity54 and lower cholesterol			2
exercising had a stronger impact on cardiovascular risk factors in women than men , possibly because of physiological differences or unmeasured factors			0
but significantly , the benefits of short bursts of less than 10 minutes yielded the same benefits as those who worked out for longer			1
examples of activities which counted included everything from cleaning the garage to badminton and golf			1
similar : the study found that short bursts of activity yielded the same benefits as longer workouts more strenuous activities like hiking , jogging , shovelling counted too			1
the researchers said the findings may work as an encouragement to those who do not have enough time to work out - or can not muster the energy to do so after a long day			0
according to @entity87 guidelines , adults should get at least two hours and 30 minutes or moderate intensity exercise a week , such as fast walking , or 75 minutes of high intensity exercise such as swimming			2
the two may be mixed together if a person so chooses , so long as they hit the target			0
lead researcher professor @entity95 of @entity96 , said : ‘ i think it ’s really important finding - because of the high levels of sedentary behaviour it is crucial to get people to be more active			2
‘ going to the gym is not the only thing you can do and things like taking the stairs and walking for the bus do add up			0
‘ it ’s important to exercise even if you do not have time to do so , and you can fit it into your day ’ .			0
