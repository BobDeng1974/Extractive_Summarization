by @entity0 for @entity1 the reason the @entity3 hit an iceberg and sunk has been hotly debated for the past century			1
while some say it was due to human error , others say the unusual appearance of a large iceberg in a region of the @entity12 was the main factor			2
but now a paper claims it was not one or the other , but rather adverse weather conditions that drove icebergs south farther than usual			1
in this graphic the dotted line shows the sea - ice limit for april 1979 - 2013 , the dashed line shows that in 1912 and the solid line shows the expected overall limit			0
@entity3 's impact with an iceberg is marked by the ' x ' the paper ' the iceberg risk in the titanic year of 1912 ' was published in the journal @entity33			2
some researchers have argued that the iceberg responsible for the demise of the @entity3 was sent on its deadly path by the closest approach of the moon to the @entity40 in 1,400 years			1
@entity42 researchers claimed in 2012 that a once - in - a - lifetime lunar event created a super-high tide on january 12 , 1912			2
the tide dislodged icebergs from shallow waters off the coasts of @entity48 and @entity49 , filling shipping lanes with icebergs			0
the ice field in the area the @entity3 sank was so thick with icebergs responding rescue ships were forced to slow down			2
but researchers from the @entity19 have now attempted to dispel this as a myth and claimed the risk is much greater now			0
it describes how the distance the iceberg that sunk the @entity3 had drifted south was much farther than would have been expected at the time			1
while they admit stresses on the crew might have been a factor , they say the surprising appearance of such a large iceberg meant the ship ’s fate was down to poor luck			1
‘ it is most likely that a combination of human errors associated with the captain not reducing speed - despite a number of ice reports reaching the vessel in the days before the collision - and possible variable rivet quality in the hull manufacture led to the tragedy , ’ the authors write			1
‘ however , the question has often been raised : was the @entity3 unlucky in sailing in a year with exceptional iceberg numbers ? ’ at 0240 gmt on 15 april 1912 , the @entity3 struck a large iceberg while 400 miles ( 643km ) from land			1
about 330ft ( 100 metres ) of the hull below the waterline buckled , flooding the ship with water across several compartments			0
in just over 2.5 hours the ship sunk ( illustrated ) , claiming 1,514 lives in the process this photograph shows the iceberg which sank the @entity3			1
the @entity3 only had visual sightings and a shipboard radio to guide it through iceberg - infested waters while today there is an extensive ice harzard warning service in the northwest @entity12 , provided by the @entity107 ( @entity107 ) , in 1912 ships relied on largely on information from others at sea			1
in early april 1912 a number of icebergs had been reported in the northwest @entity12 , which suggests it may have been an exceptional year for icebergs - although not a record			0
the @entity107 monitors icebergs by the number that drift south below the 48 ° n line called the @entity119 , which runs from @entity49 to 40 ° w. this includes any iceberg greater than 16 feet ( 5m ) in above - surface length			2
in 1912 1,038 icebergs are thought to have crossed the line - a large number , but not the most on record			0
in 2009 , for example , over 1,200 icebergs were seen to cross the @entity119			0
the iceberg which sank the @entity3 was spotted just before midnight on 14 april 1912 and was 1,640 feet ( 500m ) away			2
pictured is one possible path taken by the iceberg that sank @entity3 over 100 years ago ‘ the iceberg risk in 1912 , in terms of number entering the northwest @entity12 shipping lanes , was therefore large , but not unprecedented , ’ the authors write			1
icebergs , however , generally lose most of their size while drifting south			0
it is thought that the @entity142 was up to 605ft ( 185m ) deep and about 410ft ( 125m ) long , quite large for one so far south			2
the reason for this , the authors say , was because high pressure dominated the mid-latitude , central @entity12 atmosphere for several days in 1912			0
this led to winds carrying freezing air from northeastern @entity152 over the western @entity12 south of @entity49 and , in turn , led to icebergs being transferred further south than normal for that time of year			0
indeed , the distance south this particular iceberg travelled while maintaining the bulk of its size was largely unusual , despite being in a year with not a record number of icebergs			0
‘ thus , two unfavourable factors had combined : there were a greater ( though not exceptionally greater ) number of icebergs than normal that year ; and weather conditions had driven them further south , and earlier in the year , than was usual , ’ the authors write			1
they add , however : ‘ we may add a third : the stresses on the crew of the @entity3 ’s maiden voyage			1
’ after crashing into an iceberg , the ship that was described as ' unsinkable ' went under in just two and a half hours leaving 1,517 people dead and only 700 survivors			0
its wreck is pictured here			0

researchers say a combination of factors led to the sinking of the @entity3
they say a larger iceberg than usual sent south by rare weather conditions meant the ship encountered the large hunk of ice
the crew were unlucky in encountering such an iceberg , the authors say
however they add stresses on the crew also played a part in the event
