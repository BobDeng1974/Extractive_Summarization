from 3d sets , to televisions with curved screens - it may seem as if there is already a tv to suit any living room			1
but @entity7 is reportedly working on screens that fit seamlessly together - potentially making the days of having to pick the perfect sized screen to fit a given space a thing of the past			1
the search giant said the screens would fit seamlessly together in a similar way to @entity17 bricks , and wo n't have a surrounding bezel , like current smartphones and tablets			1
its modular system would be different to video walls ( illustrated ) which show different images on different screens with spaces between them engineers at the @entity32 , in @entity33 , which is also responsible for the company ’s self - driving car , are working on the new screens , @entity30 reported			1
it is rumoured that the screens could be put together to form different shapes , enabling users to watch films on a large widescreen , before reassembling the screen blocks to view a document in portrait format , or simply choosing to use one of them as a smaller screen			0
the project is at an early stage as the experts at @entity7 try to work out how to makes screens without bezels that can connect together seamlessly , and work as one large screen			1
it is reportedly being led by @entity57 , co-founder of @entity58			0
it appears that @entity7 believes the future is likely to be modular , because the company is already working on @entity63 smartphones ( pictured ) , where components clip together			1
they could be ready for consumers to buy in january according to the developer kit , @entity63 phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies , it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module			1
each phone will have a central ' spine ' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed ' endo ' - made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to			0
there will be three different sized endos - including mini , medium and large - to rival the existing range of phones currently on the market , from compacts to phablets			0
larger phones will be able to accommodate either larger , or additional modules , than the mini will			0
@entity7 's kit describes various modules including batteries , @entity94 and @entity95 chips , cameras , speakers and more			1
in theory , any sensor that can be fitted to a module will be able to attach to a module and while @entity7 will make the shell , these modules will be made by other companies			2
by printing their own parts , users will also be able to customise them			0
the phone is set to be available in january 2015 with prices starting from just $ 50 ( £ 31 )			1

the idea is that the @entity63 phones will be able run on multiple batteries , so that when one battery dies , it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module			2
lower - resolution cameras can be swapped with higher - res versions , and users will be also be able to @entity126 replacement parts			0
