extreme temperatures , flash flooding is set to become far more common towards the end of the century , a group of respected scientists has predicted			1
changes in weather patterns globally will make people , especially ageing populations , far more vulnerable to extreme hot spells , according to a report published by the @entity11			1
and the experts also predict that the impact of blazing summers will increase ten-fold by 2100 , while the impact of flooding will more than quadruple over the same period , the report estimates			2
scientists calculated the impact of climate change and population changes on the chances of people being affected by floods , droughts and heatwaves around the world			1
these maps reveal the estimated changes , shown as ratios for the period 2080 to 2099 , compared to the period of 1986 to 2005 scientists calculated the impact of climate change and population changes on the chances of people being affected by floods , droughts and heatwaves around the world			1
extended hot periods like that seen in 2003 - when temperatures soared to 101 ° f ( 38.5 ° c ) and railway tracks buckled in the heat - will become far more common			0
more than 2,000 people are thought to have died of heat - related causes in the @entity43 in 2003 , along with 20,000 in the rest of @entity45			2
roads melted , trains were forced to slow down because of warped tracks , and hosepipe bans were imposed across the country			0
the report focuses on the risks to people from floods , droughts and heatwaves			2
@entity56 parts of the world are expected to get drier and wetter parts , wetter			1
increasing population numbers in areas that are exposed to extreme weather events exacerbate the risks from floods and droughts in many regions - especially @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
over- 65s are one of the groups most vulnerable to heatwaves , which could hit the @entity43 and @entity45			2
changes in temperature and humidity could result in significant reductions in ability to work outdoors across much of @entity68 , @entity70 , and parts of @entity81 , @entity70 and @entity82			0
this would impact rural communities and food production for a growing global population			0
animals in zoos were treated with sun - tan cream and their food was frozen into ice lollies			0
the new research suggests that such events could become much more common in years to come			2
scientists adopted a ‘ worst case ’ scenario by assuming an increase in average temperatures around the world of up to 4.8 ° c by 2100			0
the researchers defined a heatwave as a run of five days during which night - time temperatures are at least 5 ° c above the norm			0
professor @entity106 , from the @entity107 - one of the authors of the @entity11 report , said : ‘ we measure exposure to individuals			1
that goes up because of more extreme events and because the size of the vulnerable population increases			0
‘ climate change increases the risk to people by a factor of two or three and population change multiplies that by at least 1.5 and up to four times in the case of heatwaves			1
’ the report also found a dramatically increased risk of exposure to flooding in the @entity43 and parts of western @entity45 , while the threat of drought hung over the @entity131			1
climate change is expected to make wetter parts of the world wetter and drier parts drier			1
the report issued an urgent call to both governments and private companies to do more to address extreme weather hazards			1
scientists adopted a ‘ worst case ’ scenario by assuming an increase in average temperatures around the world of up to 4.8 ° c by 2100			0
climate change is expected to make wetter parts of the world wetter and drier parts drier ( pictured ) this chart shows the global average surface temperature change as predicted in the report			1
the blue section is based on the best case scenario , while the red section depicts how hot the globe will become if the worst case scenario happens up to 2100 engineering solutions such as dams , sea walls and levees were often costly and also at risk of failing ‘ cataclysmically ’ , it was claimed			0
co-author @entity165 , chairman of the @entity166 - which advises public and private institutions on risk , said it city planners need to factor in the increased likelihood of extreme weather events			1
between 1980 and 2004 the total cost of extreme - weather related events came to us $ 1.4 trillion ( of which only a quarter was insured			2
floods , droughts and heatwaves also cost lives			0
populations in poorer countries make up only 11 per cent of those exposed to hazards but account for 53 per cent of disaster mortality , according to the report			0
it compares various practical options for the most effective and affordable defence against the impacts of extreme weather events and calls for governments and private companies to work together in order to protect people			1
the @entity11 report also calls for changes to regulations to ensure financial experts are aware of the risks of extreme weather events			1
currently , business surveys , economic forecasts and country briefings that guide investment decisions and credit ratings are typically based on the availability of skilled labour , access to export markets , political and economic stability , and financial incentives – but there is little or no consideration of actual or potential exposure to disaster risks			0
experts want this to change			0
‘ we will re-build most of the world ’s cities in the next 30 years , literally , ’ he said			0
‘ we have a choice whether to build them to be vulnerable or resilient			0
’ professor @entity225 , from @entity226 - who chaired the @entity11 working group , said : ‘ resilience means people are able to do more than just cope with disastrous events			1
they ’re not just absorbing the impact , they ’re able to continue living their lives and to prepare for future such events			0
’ the report was welcomed by climate scientists and green groups , who said it is a wake - up call to governments around the world			2
professor @entity242 of the @entity243 said : ‘ this timely report reminds us that extreme weather events affect us all , that we are not as resilient to current extreme events as we could be and that the nature of extreme events is likely to change in the future			1
‘ it also highlights the range of actions we can take to increase our resilience in a changing world and the key roles that governments together with their agencies and the insurance industry must play			0
‘ at a time when deep cuts are being made in public spending it is essential that government does not lose sight of its key role in enabling resilience at both the international and national level			0
’ @entity270 climate campaigner @entity271 said : ‘ as the anniversary of @entity43 's wettest winter ever approaches , this @entity11 report is a timely wake - up call for politicians to get serious about protecting the country from climate change			1
‘ the chancellor must use next week ’s @entity279 to invest seriously in flood defence schemes to protect hundreds of thousands of @entity43 households and businesses increasingly at risk from extreme weather			1
‘ @entity285 must also do far more to tackle climate change in the first place – ending tax breaks for dirty gas and oil and investing in a massive energy efficiency programme instead would be a good first step			2
' this chart reveals how sea levels are expected to rise until the end of the century			2
again , the blue section is based on the best case scenario , while the red section depicts how hot the globe will become if the worst case scenario happens up to 2100			0

a @entity11 report claims extreme weather events will become more *frequent* across the world in the years to come
global *warming* could increase the risk of life - *threatening* heatwaves more than *10-fold* by the end of the century
heatwaves are also expected to pose threat to ageing people in @entity45
climate change will make wet parts of the world wetter and *dry* parts drier
