when the privacy storm erupted around @entity2 and other sites , one thing became readily apparent : most users were simply not aware of what they had signed up for			1
so , in a move to allay complaints , @entity2 has created a new section that makes it easier for the average user to understand the site 's terms and conditions			1
called @entity14 , the social network now breaks down all aspects of the site 's terms of use for users in simple infographics - and also shows people how to change their privacy settings			1
it also has step by step instructions for users to alter their settings the site details what other @entity2 users see about you when they use the site , as well as how they interact with you			1
it also includes guides on how to change various settings , and control how you share content on @entity2 , including how to change privacy settings			1
the move has been welcomed by privacy campaigners , but they warn this should be the first step of many taken to improve the transparency of social networks			0
- @entity53 data for posts and photos that are shared on the site			2
- the type of content you look at on @entity2 , as well as the frequency and duration spent looking at it			0
- information and content about you from other users ; including when they share a photo with you or send you a message			0

@entity74 , director of privacy rights group @entity75 said : ' it is certainly positive that steps are being taken to simplify privacy settings and to help educate users to have more control over their privacy			0
' however , there is always more that could and should be done			0
' with many internet companies ' privacy policies and terms and conditions being longer than @entity90 plays and requiring multiple law degrees to understand , users are undoubtedly still in the dark about how their information is accessed and manipulated			2
' until companies stop bamboozling their users with complicated and lengthy jargon , they simply can not claim to be transparent or take the privacy of their users seriously			0
' @entity2 ( stock image shown ) has been criticised in recent years for its privacy settings , but it is launching the site to make it simpler for people to understand the terms and conditions of the social network the new site ( screenshot shown ) is designed to make it easier for people to understand what they are signing up for			1
but one expert warns this should be just the first step of many @entity2 appear to be trying to do just that , with the @entity25 - based firm also confirming that a new version of their terms of service will come into effect on 1 january , with notifications being sent to @entity2 users alerting them to the change and encouraging them to read the new agreement - which is accepted through continued use of the site and its official apps			1
the new agreement has been made shorter , with parts relating to developers and advertisers both significantly cut down or moved to new pages in a move that @entity2 hopes will make the agreements easier to digest			2
in the blog post that announced the new @entity14 set - up , @entity2 's chief privacy officer @entity134 said that the aim was to better educate users on how they could take control of their data			1
' @entity141 offers interactive guides to answer the most commonly asked questions about how you can control your information on @entity2 , ' she said			0
' for example , you can learn about untagging , unfriending , and blocking , and how to choose an audience for your posts			0
' with the new system in place , @entity2 now also more clearly details the information about users it obtains .			2
